This application claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 61 523 756 entitled Revision Systems Tools and Methods for Revising Joint Arthroplasty Implants filed Aug. 15 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates to orthopedic methods systems and prosthetic devices and more particularly relates to methods systems and devices for articular resurfacing and for correcting failed surgical resurfacing and or replacement implants. The disclosure also includes surgical tools molds and or jigs designed to achieve optimal cut planes in a joint in preparation for installation of a joint revision implant.

Joint arthroplasties can be highly invasive and often require surgical resection of the entirety or a majority of the articular surface of one or more bones involved in the repair. In various procedures the marrow space can be fairly extensively reamed in order to fit the stem of the prosthesis within the bone. Reaming results in a loss of the patient s bone stock and over time subsequent osteolysis will frequently lead to loosening of the prosthesis. Further the area where the implant and the bone mate can degrade over time requiring the prosthesis to eventually be replaced. Since the patient s bone stock is limited the number of possible replacement surgeries is also limited for joint arthroplasty. In short over the course of 15 to 20 years and in some cases even shorter time periods the patient can run out of therapeutic options ultimately resulting in a painful non functional joint and or requiring fusion or partial fusion of the joint.

Current joint replacement and or resurfacing implants and the surgical corrections associated with implanting such devices are generally accepted to be of finite duration. That is assuming the patient s continued survival and or continued use of the joint every joint replacement and or repair procedure will eventually require further surgery to repair and or replace a failed or failing joint implant.

Failure of an implant and or surgical correction can be a result of various causes. The implant may fracture loosen or disassemble in some manner or components may simply wear out and or cease to properly function after prolonged use. Similarly implant failure may be due to failure of the underlying support and or anchoring structures either due to continued progression of disease or pursuant to unexpected and or excessive stresses. Moreover an implant may fail where it has been malpositioned or where it is experiencing unexpected unacceptable loading for a variety of factors. Another contributing failure factor could be excessive pain generated and or felt at the implant site. Other failure factors can include excessive debris generation scar tissue intrusion into the joint space and or unacceptable inflammation swelling of the joint uncontrollable infection at the implant site and or development of necrosis cysts malignant neoplasm or other localized or systemic disease necessitating implant removal.

Regardless of the underlying cause the removal of a failed implant generally necessitates a surgical intervention to remove or otherwise revise the original failed implant. Such a procedure also typically involves the placement of a subsequent or revision implant in the joint space to correct the underlying joint function and or otherwise address additional hard and soft tissue damage that may have occurred during the initial implant removal process and or during subsequent preparation and placement of the revision implant. However because a significant and potentially unknown amount of the original anatomical support structure is generally removed during the original implant surgery to place the original implant now failed or failing because additional native support structures may be removed with the failed implant because the amount of further degradation of the anatomical support structure post original surgery is generally unknown or undetermined prior to removal of the failed implant during the revision surgery and because artifacts from the failed or failing implant often distort or otherwise mask anatomical or other features obtained using non invasive imaging methods there remains a significant need for improvements in the planning and execution of revision surgeries.

Current surgical revision procedures typically fail to utilize many sources of highly relevant patient and or implant related information in planning and executing implant revision procedures. Moreover the information available to a surgeon and or information that is presented to the surgeon is generally not properly assessed for accuracy and or cross referenced compared to other available relevant information to ensure accurate reflection of the condition of the patient s anatomy and or the failed implant. The failure to assess multiple sources of information accurately the failure to cross reference and or evaluate such information to create a more comprehensive picture of the failed implant and the patient s disease state and the failure to provide a treating surgeon with an accurate pre operative evaluation of the failed implant the patient s anatomy the disease state and or the information regarding the potential surgical site significantly reduces the opportunity for a surgeon to correct the failed implant in a least invasive and or most effective manner. Moreover the failure to have such information available during the planning and implant design phase may result in designing or choosing an incorrect unsuitable implant and or an implant that requires removal of healthy bone stock which could have been preserved for future use if the patient s anatomy were appropriately assessed.

In addition this disclosure further includes the realization that one or more components of a failed or failing implant can often be utilized as one or more accurate reference points to facilitate the repair or replacement of a failed or failing partial or total joint replacement implant. In current revision surgery a surgeon initially removes the failed implant components and then prepares the anatomical support structure for the revision implant. Because much of the supporting anatomical structure may have been removed and or modified during the original surgery to accommodate the original failed implant and because addition anatomical degradation anatomical structure removal and or remodeling may have occurred prior to the revision surgery a significant amount of time and effort and a significant number of surgical tools are utilized by the surgeon to locate desired anatomical alignment and or positioning relative to any virgin anatomical reference points i.e. intramedullary canal reference points etc. . However much of the additional alignment efforts can be readily reduced or obviated by the use of anatomical reference points from the existing implant components which can often be readily visualized via non invasive imaging methods. When desired reference planes and or reference positions can be identified and or determined relative to such implant reference points such as through an electronic evaluation system utilizing non invasive imaging information such reference points can be particularly useful as anatomical reference points for the planning and or conduct of the surgery. Where surgical reference tools and or jigs incorporate surfaces that match or otherwise substantially conform to some portion of the failed implant and are connected to or otherwise positioned relative to the failed implant prior to component removal or other displacement of the component relative to the patient s joint the failed implant can provide a highly accurate reference for subsequent surgical steps including the placement of anatomical reference markers i.e. alignment pins etc. or for aligning surgical cutting and or drilling reaming tools for the creation of desired cutting planes openings. Moreover because implant failure can often be attributed to the failure of one component or portion of a component i.e. a tibial stem will loosen while the femoral stem remains intact or a condylar component will fracture with the remainder of the femoral component attached to the femur the remaining component or component portions can often be utilized as a highly accurate reference position as well.

This disclosure describes systems devices and methods for collecting and assessing multiple sources of patient implant and potentially general population anatomical data cross referencing and evaluating the various data sources and providing an evaluated output for a surgeon and or implant designer manufacturer to use in choosing designing manufacturing and implanting a replacement or revision implant in a selected patient or patients.

The various embodiments of systems devices and methods discussed herein including the various systems for collecting assessing utilizing and presenting multiple sources of patient and or other surgical data may be particularized or personalized for a selected target audience such as for a surgeon for planning and performing a surgical implant revision procedure for an implant designer for designing a revision implant or for a patient who wished to visualize and or evaluate the outcome of a knee replacement procedure. Such output may comprise different data different presentation methods differing evaluations and or analysis or various combinations particularized based upon an intended use for the information. In a similar manner various embodiments may compare and evaluate prior scan image data relative to later scan data and create an output map or other presentation of the patient s anatomy highlighting areas of bone growth or reduction as well as changes in bone quality i.e. increases decreases in cancellous or cortical bone quality or quantity as well as other tissue types i.e. changes in articular cartilage and or soft tissue quality and or scarification . Such outputs could be extremely useful in diagnosing and or treating underlying disease or other issues prior to during or after implant or implant revision surgery.

In addition this disclosure describes utilizing one or more portions of an existing failed implant either alone or in combination with other natural or artificial anatomical features as one or more anatomical reference points to assist in the planning surgical preparation and or alignment of surgical cutting instruments and or to facilitate placement of a revision implant.

The current disclosure also contemplates the use of various pre operative anatomical and failed implant data in the design and implantation of a desired revision implant. For example where an implant has fractured or otherwise failed in some manner such for example due to repetitive loading and wear over an extended period of time the pre operative data as well as other data may be utilized to determine the failure mode s of the implant and an implant design approach can be tailored to desirably alleviate or account for such potential failure after implantation of the revision implant. Where such failure has been due to long term repetitive wear the revision implant and associated surgical procedure could be chosen to correct of modify such loading in the joint or the implant procedure could be modified to increase the ability of the implant to withstand such loads and or wear such as by thickening the implant dimensions and or utilizing harder or more durable materials. Similar design changes could be utilized where patient implants have failed due to excessive stress such as where the patient participates in particular high impact sports or the like. Such improved implants might require additional or differing anatomical support i.e. a larger joint space to accommodate a thicker implant potentially requiring some additional bone resection in various regions which could alter the anticipated surgical procedure but potentially result in an implant having a significantly better long term outcome than one not tailored to accommodate specific loading conditions and or real world performance. Various embodiments contemplate the use of such additional modeling data in implant design as well as design of surgical tools and jigs to facilitate the implantation of such implant.

The various embodiments of systems devices and methods discussed herein can also desirably utilize pre operative data to assess and potentially accommodate unusual and or unexpected anatomical situations such as ideal alignment with the articular surfaces and the resultant joint congruity. Poor alignment and poor joint congruity can for example lead to instability of the joint. In the knee joint instability typically manifests as a lateral instability of the joint. Lateral instability may manifest itself in various ways including pain loosening of the implant and or excessive wear and or implant failure.

There is also a need for tools that increase the accuracy of positioning of a revision implant as well as increasing the accuracy of cuts made to the bone in a joint in preparation for surgical implantation of for example a revision system for replacing a failed artificial joint implant. This disclosure provides novel devices and methods for replacing a portion e.g. diseased area and or area slightly larger than the diseased area of a patient s joint e.g. cartilage and or bone with a non pliable non liquid e.g. hard implant material where the implant achieves a near anatomic fit with the surrounding structures and tissues of the patient s joint. In cases where the devices and or methods include an element associated with the underlying articular bone this disclosure also provides that the bone associated element achieves a near anatomic alignment with the subchondral bone.

This disclosure provides systems methods and compositions for repairing joints particularly for repairing and or replacing implants and implant components previously implanted into a patient s joint as well as repairing articular cartilage and for facilitating the integration of a wide variety of cartilage repair materials into a subject. Among other things the techniques described herein allow for the customization of implants and surgical tools to suit a particular subject for example in terms of size thickness shapes and or curvatures. Desirably such tools can utilize and existing failed implant information and or surfaces as one or more anatomical reference points to assist in the preparation positioning and or placement of a replacement implant for repairing a patient s joint.

When the shape e.g. size thickness and or curvature of the articular cartilage surface is an exact or near anatomic fit with the non damaged cartilage or with the subject s original cartilage the success of repair is enhanced. The repair material can be shaped prior to implantation and such shaping can be based for example on electronic images that provide information regarding curvature or thickness of any normal cartilage surrounding the defect and or on curvature of the bone underlying the defect. Thus the current invention provides among other things for minimally invasive methods for partial joint replacement. The methods will require only minimal or in some instances no loss in bone stock. Additionally unlike with current techniques the methods described herein will help to restore the integrity of the articular surface by achieving an exact or near anatomic match between the implant and the surrounding or adjacent cartilage and or subchondral bone. Moreover if the failed implant only requires replacement of one or more individual failed components the procedure may be less invasive than a complete joint removal and replacement and could thus be accomplished in a less invasive and or minimally invasive fashion desirably with commensurately less recovery time.

The various embodiments described in the present disclosure also contemplate the use of existing failed implant components or portions thereof as anchoring mechanisms attachment points anatomical reference structures and or as components of the revision implant ultimately used in repairing the patient s joint. In some instances components of the failed implant may be useful for a myriad of reasons including if the failed implant component is well fixed to the patient s anatomy and failure of the original failed implant was due to other implant components. In a similar manner certain components of a partial joint replacement may be integrated into the revision system either as a module or component of the revision implant or if the partial joint component is encased by the revision implant or otherwise used to support the revision implant components. Similarly well secured anchors or other components from a failed implant may be reused to anchor the revision implant if desired and available.

Advantages of this disclosure can include but are not limited to i customization of joint repair thereby enhancing the efficacy and comfort level for the patient following the repair procedure ii eliminating the need for a surgeon to measure the defect to be repaired intraoperatively in some embodiments iii eliminating the need for a surgeon to shape the material during the implantation procedure iv providing methods of evaluating curvature of the repair material based on implant bone or tissue images or based on intraoperative probing techniques v providing methods of repairing joints with only minimal or in some instances no loss in bone stock and vi improving postoperative joint congruity.

Thus the methods described herein allow for the design and use of joint repair material that more precisely fits the defect e.g. site of implantation and accordingly provides improved repair of the joint.

The methods and compositions described herein can be used to treat defects resulting from disease of the cartilage e.g. osteoarthritis bone damage cartilage damage trauma and or degeneration due to overuse or age. This disclosure allows among other things a health practitioner to evaluate and treat such defects. The size volume and shape of the area of interest can include only the region of cartilage that has the defect but preferably will also include contiguous parts of the cartilage surrounding the cartilage defect.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art size curvature and or thickness measurements can be obtained using any suitable technique. For example one dimensional two dimensional and or three dimensional measurements can be obtained using suitable mechanical means laser devices electromagnetic or optical tracking systems molds materials applied to the articular surface that harden and memorize the surface contour and or one or more imaging techniques known in the art. Measurements can be obtained non invasively and or intraoperatively e.g. using a probe or other surgical device . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the thickness of the repair device can vary at any given point depending upon the depth of the damage to the cartilage and or bone to be corrected at any particular location on an articular surface.

As illustrated in typically the process begins by first obtaining one or more images of a patient s joint that requires revision. This group of images will typically have a series of images of the patient s current joint which typically includes various images of the failed or failing implant i.e. failed implant images . If available the groups of images will desirably further include other images taken earlier in the treatment progression of the failed joint including 1 images of the joint and or implant taken between the time of original implantation and failure of the prior implant i.e. pre failure implant images 2 images of the joint and or implant taken at the time of original implantation i.e. initial implantation images 3 images taken prior to initial implantation of the failed implant i.e. pre implant work up images and 4 images taken prior to significant failure of the patient s natural joint i.e. healthy joint images . Various additional image sources useful for this disclosure could include images of the failed implant both pre and post failure i.e. implant data information or images regarding the types and locations of bone cement and or bony in growth structures and any other anatomical data available regarding the patient including resection surface information residual cartilage osteophytes osteolysis and or information regarding injuries or disease states that may affect joint and or bone strength in any manner i.e. osteoporosis arthritis etc. . Where such additional image groups are readily available it may be desirable to include such information in the current image group. Other sources of information could include databases of non patient individuals i.e. information from specific or general individuals including normalized information from specific or general population groups .

Table 1 provides a non exhaustive list of various data sources and image characteristics particularly useful in practicing the present invention 

At any point in the various disclosed embodiment the quality and reliability of various images may be assessed for accuracy completeness and are desirably normalized to a set standard or standards to facilitate their use during subsequent steps of the disclosed invention. It is desirable that images of poor quality and or low accuracy will desirably be identified and if of lesser utility given a rating of low confidence and or are discarded. In a similar manner higher quality images and or those of better accuracy may be given a higher confidence rating. If desired images may be processed and or enhanced to improve the usefulness of data contained therein in a known manner.

If desired the various images in the image group may be evaluated and or assessed or cross referenced against one another. For example it may be advantageous to compare contrast and evaluate the various anatomical image groups over time i.e. healthy joint initial implantation pre failure implant and or failed implant images to determine disease progression and or estimate future disease progression. In a similar manner it may be advantageous to compare contrast and evaluate the various implant image groups over time i.e. initial implantation pre failure implant and or failed implant images to determine and or identify implant failure modes i.e. implant fracture unacceptable or uneven wear zones dislocation modular failures etc. or underlying anatomical failure modes i.e. underlying support structure failure soft tissue disease kinematic imbalances tissue scarification metastatic disease or infection etc. .

 Cross Referencing of images in the context of the current disclosure contemplates the comparison of one image to another image in the same or a different group of images. Desirably the cross referenced images will have a common anatomical or other reference feature which facilitates the comparison of features between the relevant images. Cross referencing can be in 2D and 3D 2D data can be cross referenced against 3D data. Historical data can be cross referenced against current data. Such cross referencing and comparison can be between images as well as between individual anatomical features of each image against other anatomical features in the same image and or against similar features from other images.

In addition information from one set of images may be utilized in comparison with other images to identify inaccuracies or discrepancies across images and or among image groups which may decrease confidence in the accuracy of some images and or identify additional areas of anatomical concern i.e. implant fracture and or dislocation . In a similar manner information from one set of images may be utilized in comparison with other images to identify consistencies and or congruencies across images which may increase confidence in the accuracy of the various images and or image components features or areas of interest and or identify anatomical and or implant areas that remain unchanged or not of concern over time. The various accuracies and inaccuracies may be rated and identified in various ways including through the use of a heat map or color chart that provides a 2 D 3 D or 4 D i.e. time lapse or other such presentation rendering of the anatomy and implant with areas of high confidence in cool colors i.e. blue and green and areas of low confidence in hot colors i.e. yellow and red corresponding to various comparison factors such as 1 significant changes in anatomy 2 significant changes in implant characteristics and or alignment 3 significant perceived inaccuracies across image series and 4 significant areas or scarification bone remodeling etc. Various embodiments may display and or identify areas of estimated anatomical margins and or implant location as a confidence contour map or other display.

Another advantage for conducting comparisons across image series could include identifying and or correcting imaging inaccuracies caused or induced by artifacts or other factors during the imaging process. For example metallic artifacts including metallic joint replacement implants are known to affect the quality of some non invasive image methods i.e. x ray CT MRI etc. to various degrees especially where the location of interest is adjacent to the artifacts. Not only can such artifacts mask the anatomy near such objects but such artifacts may cause significant image distortion which significantly reduces the utility of such imaging in planning and assessing anatomical structures during revision procedures. If desired artifact reduction algorithms or other processing steps including enhancement of low metal artifact information as well as imaging techniques desirably less sensitive to artifact distortion may be utilized in an attempt to improve image quality and or reliability. In addition the use and comparison of multiple images of the same anatomical region and or implant utilizing differing imaging methods to desirably highlight different types and or portions of anatomy and or implant are contemplated in various embodiments. The use of other images in the image series including images taken prior to initial implantation of the artifact can be used to cross check the accuracy of such artifact laden images and may also be used to correct such distortion where applicable. In a similar manner data regarding the structure of the failed implant may be especially useful in such situations. The external margins of the failed implant are often readily discernable on non invasive images and knowledge of the internal and peripheral features of the implant i.e. implant design shape and size including bone facing surfaces of the implant can be calculated and or cross referenced from or against the external margins to estimate the location of corresponding internal surfaces which are desirably adjacent to estimated margins of the anatomical support structures . Moreover knowledge of the internal surface location can be used to cross reference against other images including against other images of the same implant from differing angles as well as can be used to identify limits or locations where anatomical structures can or cannot be. I.e. any image that identifies an anatomical structure within a location where the implant exists i.e. anatomy and implant structure at the same 3 dimensional location should be either incorrect or may indicate a fractured dislocated or otherwise displaced implant. Information regarding the thicknesses of implant material at various locations or along various planes may also be useful in evaluating the amount of distortion experienced in a given image or portion of image. Similar implant data can be utilized to determine the thickness of a metal implant along various planes of imaging and may be utilized to estimate the amount of implant distortion experienced as well as to identify preferred imaging angle to reduce or minimize distortion i.e. choose imaging planes to minimize implant thickness or to place known planar implant surfaces perpendicular to x ray imaging etc .

In one exemplary embodiment the use of images from a prior scan of the patient in combination with a current scan of the patient containing failed implant image s and known data regarding the shape and size of the failed implant including internal and external surface dimensions can be processed and or utilized to provide significant useful data regarding the quality and quantity of anatomical support structure available for use with a revision implant procedure. By knowing the amount of potential anatomical support structure remaining this embodiment allows the revision implant to be selected and or designed to require minimum resection and or preparation of remaining anatomical support structures after implant removal. In addition if the implant has fractured or otherwise failed in a manner whereby the anatomical support structure has remained substantially intact a replacement revision implant can be chosen or designed that requires little or no alteration to the underlying anatomical support structure prior to implantation. If desired the bone facing structures of the revision implant can replicate those of the failed implant to facilitate implantation with little or no cutting or preparation of the underlying anatomical surfaces while alterations to the joint facing or articulating structures and or the thickness of the implant can alter the biomechanics of the revision implant and revised joint in a desirable manner.

Another alternate embodiment could utilize the original scans of the patient s anatomy either prior to or after initial implantation of the primary implant to create a revision implant and or surgical tools for use in preparing the anatomical support surfaces for the revision implant. Such devices could include patient specific anatomical support surfaces for alignment and or placement of the revision implant. If desired the original scan data could be normalized assessed evaluated and or corrected as described herein to improve image accuracy and or quality.

In a similar manner the images may be corrected or otherwise evaluated for accuracies relevant to the type and size thickness of the implant other artifact or general or specific known or unknown inaccuracies in the imaging equipment and or modality. For example areas of high metal concentration i.e. thicker sections of an implant may be more prone to artifact distortion than areas of lesser metal concentration. Similarly various metal types may be more or less prone to artifact distortion as will artifacts having low metal content such as some ceramics and polymers. In addition the different types of imaging equipment are likely to have different accuracies not only due to the differing imaging modalities i.e. 2 D vs. 3D vs. 4D imaging MRI CT scan CAT fluoroscopy and x ray ultrasound PET and or other radiographic nuclear photo acoustic thermographic tomographic and or ultrasonic imaging techniques etc. but also calibration of the related equipment age of the scans i.e. older scans may have been held to a lower accuracy standard or may have degraded in storage and inherent differences in the equipment and or the various environments of use i.e. heat temperature etc . All of some of these various factors may be included with image data to increase decrease or otherwise assess the confidence of the data accuracy which may affect how such data is viewed and or rated during assessment evaluation comparison cross referencing and or correction of some of all of the image data. For example where an older image depicts an anatomical feature that does not correlate to more recent image groups the older image data may be considered less reliable than newer image data and may be appropriately assessed i.e. discarded or assigned a low reliability value or alternatively may be judged to be more reliable where the older image was taken without artifact interference or by a more reliable imaging modality etc. Each image or image group including individual features of interest within an image may if desired be assigned such reliability ratings or individual features of images may have differing reliability ratings or combinations thereof. The assessment system may also identify common anatomical features across differing image groups which may affect reliability ratings in either a positive or negative manner.

This disclosure contemplates a wide variety of priority or ranking systems for use with the various assessment and evaluation systems of the present invention. Virtually any combination of priorities can be incorporated into the assessment and evaluation process typically on a user defined basis although the use of pre defined priorities and or groups of priorities is also encompassed by this disclosure. For example higher priorities may be given to data assessed as having a greater likelihood of accuracy as defined by the user and or system. Such greater likelihood could be due to a wide variety of factors including 1 inherent accuracy of the imaging method 2 multiple groups of images identifying a common anatomical feature or features and or failed implant feature or features in the same or similar location and or 3 images where artifacts are absent or have been corrected for. Similarly the evaluation process can include varying priorities as defined by the user or others including 1 cost priorities for selecting and or designing an implant in the most cost efficient or least cost efficient or any variations thereof manner i.e. manufacturing costs material costs processing machining costs use of pre existing implants versus custom built implants etc. 2 scheduling or availability priorities for selecting and or designing an implant in the time efficient or least time efficient or any variations thereof manner i.e. to ensure an implant will be available for use within a specified time frame etc. and or 3 inventory management issues i.e. to utilize materials and or implant sizes that are already manufactured and or are being manufactured in larger quantities etc .

Once the images have been compared evaluated cross referenced and or normalized one or more composite image sets or output sets or generated images may be produced that desirably reflect one or more of the following 1 the most accurate and correct image or set of images of the failed implant 2 the most accurate and complete image or set of images of the underlying anatomical support structure s and or 3 one or more images or boundary diagrams of the anatomical support structures that are estimated to remain after removal of the failed implant. This information may then be used to create revision implants and surgical tools particularized for use in removing the failed implant revising the supporting anatomical structures and implanting the revision implant in a desired fashion. Such information may also assist in evaluating and assessing the patient s disease state and or progression of disease and or degeneration over a period of time.

If desired various embodiments may include a graphical user interface GUI that allows an operator surgeon implant designer patient etc. to conduct pre operative planning of the revision procedure including simulating post operative alignment of the revision implant incorporating augments and or spacers wherein the spacer and or augment can be selected by the user and the alignment information and possible surface information can be modeled displayed and or built into or otherwise incorporated into the surgical tools and or surgical implant including jigs or guides that the jigs include.

In various embodiments an exterior surface model or frame diagram of the failed implant and surrounding anatomical structure of the joint can be created electronically and or physically if desired . In a manner similar to the creation of implants and or surgical tools and molds described previously in various embodiments of this disclosure portions of the frame diagram or physical model may be utilized to create conforming surfaces for engagement by the surgical tools and molds i.e. utilizing only surface features of the failed implant using surface features of the failed implant in combination with anatomical features of the joint surfaces and or using only anatomical features of the joint surfaces to align the tools and or molds . Similarly portions of the frame diagram or physical model may be utilized to design and or select the interior and or exterior surfaces of the revision implant.

It may also be desirous for an evaluation system to have the capability of evaluating the type and or size of failed implant in various image sets including the capability to identify unidentified implants or implant components and possibly verify the identity of a known or suspected implant type from a database of known implant designs. In many cases the exact design shape and or size of the failed implant will be unknown either because surgical records are unavailable are disorganized or are incorrect and the use of proper implant information may be important to the evaluation and assessment of various patient information. In various embodiments the system is desirably capable of evaluation the condition of various implants and or implant components facilitating identification of failed or fractured components that may require replacement while the remaining components may remain in situ as desired. Once identified information and or data regarding the various implant components can be included in the various image data groups for assessment and or evaluation and preparation of the revision implant and or tools. Of course if information regarding the failed implant is already known or is available such implant information possibly available based on patient history surgical reports and or manufacturer s records may be included utilized and or verified by the evaluation system.

Once the processing assessment evaluation and or cross referencing correcting of patient and failed implant information has been accomplished to a desired degree the resulting image and or data information may be utilized to plan the revision surgery which can include the creation of revision implants implant components and surgical tools for preparation of anatomical surfaces and implantation of the revision implant. Revision surgery is particularly well suited to the systems and methods described herein as the disclosed methods are capable of determining and or estimating the patient s anatomical structure underlying the failed implant to a degree significantly greater than that allowed by current practice. For example in a typical knee revision procedure a physician is often unaware of the actual structure and or condition of the underling margins of the anatomical support structure i.e. bone and any remaining articular surfaces that may have supported the failed implant until the failed implant has been removed in surgery. Because of this revision implants typically plan and are designed for significant bone removal to accommodate a worst case scenario where most supporting bone has degraded and often also require an intramedullary stem that serves as an alignment structure for aligning the joint implant as well as a support structure for securing the implant to the surrounding bone. With the disclosed system however a more accurate estimate of the underlying bony support structure can be determined and thus less bone and other support structures need be removed in preparing for the revision implant as well as allowing for a revision implant or implant components to be constructed appropriate to the existing support structure. In addition the identification of existing support structures in combination with the use of the failed implant as an anatomical reference point allows positioning of the revision implant without necessarily resorting to intramedullary or other highly invasive reference points or methods. Moreover the present method enables a surgeon to determine prior to surgery whether sufficient anatomical support structures remain to support the revision implant without need for an intramedullary stem or other such support structure.

If desired an appropriate revision implant can be selected from a library or a revision implant can be generated based on the patient specific parameters obtained in the measurements and evaluation. If desired surgical tools such as custom jigs to assist in the preparation of the anatomical surface can be constructed using information regarding the implant as well as the generated image data. Prior to installing the implant in the joint the implantation site is prepared and then the implant is installed. One or more of these steps can be repeated as necessary or desired as shown by the optional repeat steps. In various embodiments the surgical tools of this disclosure can be particularized for use in a patient for the implantation of a standard joint replacement implant i.e. a standard or non patient specific implant as desired.

In various embodiments the resulting image and or data information may be utilized to create a custom revision implant well suited to match and or conform to the most accurate anatomical data. In various additional embodiments the resulting data and or image information may be utilized in combination with confidence or statistical accuracy data derived by the evaluation software to a degree defined by the user. For example an implant and or surgical tool may be specifically designed to have a 95 confidence that the implant surgical tool will fit the derived anatomical structure and would thus be designed such that the internal structural surfaces would accommodate encompass and or conform to an anatomical model that follows the estimated contours of the underlying anatomical structures to at least a 95 confidence level. If desired multiple implants of various confidence levels may be produced for use in a single surgery with an implant of relatively lower confidence value being designed for a patient specific application for use in a manner similar to a rescue revision implant where actual bone conditions significantly different from those estimated or if the primary revision implant will not accommodate or properly fit the actual anatomical surfaces.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art imaging techniques suitable for measuring thickness and or curvature e.g. of cartilage and or bone or size of areas of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss include the use of x rays magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography scanning CT also known as computerized axial tomography or CAT optical coherence tomography ultrasound imaging techniques optical imaging techniques and others disclosed herein and or are well known in the art. See also International Patent Publication WO 02 22014 to Alexander et al. published Mar. 21 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 373 250 to Tsoref et al. issued Apr. 16 2002 and Vandeberg et al. 2002 222 430 436 . Contrast or other enhancing agents can be employed using any route of administration e.g. intravenous intra articular etc.

Based on the imaging performed and any assessment evaluation correction and or cross referencing performed as previously described the software may evaluate the fit of different implants and or surgical guide templates with regard to dimensions overall size and shape. The dimensions overall size and shape may be optimized with regard to cortical bone shape and dimensions cortical bone thickness endosteal bone shape size of marrow cavity articular surface shape and dimensions subchondral bone shape and dimensions or subchondral bone thickness. Thus for example an implant may either be custom made or selected from a number of pre manufactured implants that is optimized with regard to any of the following or combinations thereof AP dimensions and shape mediolateral dimensions and shape superoinferior dimensions and shape shape of the articulating surface shape and dimensions of the interface in contact with cortical bone shape and dimensions of intramedullary portions or components. These parameters may also be optimized for implant function e.g. for different degrees of joint flexion or extension or abduction or adduction or internal or external rotation.

In certain embodiments CT or MRI is used to assess tissue bone cartilage and any defects therein for example cartilage lesions or areas of diseased cartilage to obtain information on subchondral bone or cartilage degeneration and to provide morphologic or biochemical or biomechanical information about the area of damage. Specifically changes such as fissuring partial or full thickness cartilage loss and signal changes within residual cartilage can be detected using one or more of these methods. For discussions of the basic NMR principles and techniques see MRI Basic Principles and Applications Second Edition Mark A. Brown and Richard C. Semelka Wiley Liss Inc. 1999 . For a discussion of MRI including conventional T1 and T2 weighted spin echo imaging gradient recalled echo GRE imaging magnetization transfer contrast MTC imaging fast spin echo FSE imaging contrast enhanced imaging rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement RARE imaging gradient echo acquisition in the steady state GRASS and driven equilibrium Fourier transform DEFT imaging to obtain information on cartilage see Alexander et al. WO 02 22014. Other techniques include steady state free precision flexible equilibrium MRI and DESS. Thus in preferred embodiments the measurements produced are based on three dimensional images of the joint obtained as described in Alexander et al. WO 02 22014 or sets of two dimensional images ultimately yielding 3D information. Two dimensional and three dimensional images or maps of the cartilage alone or in combination with a movement pattern of the joint e.g. flexion extension translation and or rotation can be obtained. Three dimensional images can include information on movement patterns contact points contact zone of two or more opposing articular surfaces and movement of the contact point or zone during joint motion. Two and three dimensional images can include information on biochemical composition of the articular cartilage. In addition imaging techniques can be compared over time for example to provide up to date information on the shape and type of repair material needed.

Traditional CT and MRI scans utilize two dimensional cross sectional images acquired in different imaging planes to visualize complex three dimensional articular anatomy. With computed tomography these slices are typically acquired in the axial plane. The in plane resolution is typically on the order of 0.25 0.25 millimeters. The slice thickness may vary from one to five millimeters. Thus the resolution obtained with these imaging studies is not isotropic. Moreover the CT slices and similarly with MRI may be separated by one or more millimeters. This means that the resolution of the images is excellent within the imaging plane. However two to ten fold loss in image resolution can be encountered in a plane perpendicular to the slices acquired by the CT or MRI scanner. This limitation in resolution perpendicular to the imaging plane can result in inaccuracies in deriving the three dimensional shape of without limitation an implant and or a 3 D guidance template described in more detail below.

In accordance with one embodiment spiral CT imaging is utilized to acquire the images rather than standard CT technology. With recent CT technology slip ring technology is incorporated in the scanner. A slip ring is a circular contact with sliding brushes that allows the gantry to rotate continuously untethered by electrical wires. The use of slip ring technology eliminates the initial limitations at the end of each slice acquisition. Thus the rotating gantry is free to rotate continuously throughout the examination of a joint. A slip ring CT scanner design allows greater rotational velocities thereby shortening scan times. With a spiral CT scan data is acquired while the table is moving. As a result the x ray source moves in a spiral or helical rather than a circular pattern around the patient. The speed of the table motion relative to the rotation of the CT gantry is a very important consideration for image quality in helical or spiral CT scanning. This parameter is call pitch. In a preferred embodiment spiral CT scans will be acquired through the joint wherein these spiral CT scans afford a resolution that is isotropic for example 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter in x y and z direction or more preferred 0.75 0.75 0.75 millimeters in x y and z direction or more preferred 0.5 0.5 0.5 millimeters in x y and z direction or more preferred 0.25 0.25 0.25 millimeters in x y and z direction. Near isotropic data sets are also acceptable particularly if the maximum resolution in any one of the three special orientations does not exceed 1.5 millimeters or more preferred 1.0 millimeters or more preferred 0.75 millimeters or more preferred 0.5 millimeters. Thus this disclosure recognizes that the accuracy in placing a 3 D guidance template on an articular surface or shaping an implant can be greatly improved with isotropic or near isotropic data sets as compared to traditional 2 D slice based data sets derived from either CT or MRI or other imaging technologies. For example a knee joint scan data acquired with near isotropic resolution of 0.4 0.4 0.7 millimeters e.g. a resolution ratio of less than 2 1 between the different dimensions and resolution in all three dimensions preferably better than 1 mm will yield greater positional accuracy in placing a 3 D guidance template on the articular surface than scan data acquired using traditional CT scans for example with a scan resolution of 0.4 0.4 1.2 millimeters.

With MRI standard acquisition call sequences also result in two dimensional slices for displaying complex three dimensional articular anatomy. The two dimensional slices can be acquired using 2 D or 3 D Fourier transformation. After the 2 D or 3 D transform 2 D slices are available for image viewing and image processing. Of note typically the image resolution in the imaging plane will be two or more fold greater than the image resolution perpendicular to the primary imaging plane. Similar to CT this limitation in spatial resolution in the plane perpendicular to the imaging plane can result in inaccuracies in deriving and subsequently placing D guidance molds. In a preferred embodiment MRI data is acquired or processed so that the data used for generating the 3 D guidance mold or implant has isotropic or near isotropic resolution. For example isotropic or near isotropic resolution may be achieved by fusing two non parallel imaging planes acquired using standard 2 D or 3 D Fourier transform images registering them relative to each other and performing an image fusion see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 728 731 entitled FMIPIIMRI QIAIN II hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Alternatively using latest generation scan technology for example with 3 D FSE 3 D DESS 3 D MENSA 3 D PAVA 3 D LAVA 3 D MERGE 3 D MEDIC imaging sequences multi channel coils high field magnets advanced gradient technology isotropic or near isotropic acquisition using 3 D Fourier transform can be obtained. Using such advanced imaging technology image resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.8 millimeters or greater may be obtained achieving near isotropic and even isotropic resolution with preferably resolution in all three dimensions of less than 1 mm.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art imaging techniques can be combined if desired. For example C arm imaging or x ray fluoroscopy can be used for motion imaging while MRI can yield high resolution cartilage information. C arm imaging can be combined with intra articular contrast to visualize the cartilage.

Any of the imaging devices described herein can also be used intra operatively see also below for example using a hand held ultrasound and or optical probe to image the articular surface intra operatively. illustrates a color reproduction of a three dimensional thickness map of the articular surface on the distal femur. The dark holes within the cartilage indicate areas of full cartilage loss.

Imaging can be used to determine the anatomical and biomechanical axes of an extremity associated with a joint which can then be used in creating an implant or surgical guide template or mold. Suitable tests include for example an x ray or an x ray combined with an MRI. Typically anatomical landmarks are identified on the imaging test results e.g. the x ray film and those landmarks are then utilized to directly or indirectly determine the desired axes. Thus for example if surgery is contemplated in a hip joint knee joint or ankle joint an x ray can be obtained. This x ray can be a weight bearing film of the extremity for example a full length leg film taken while the patient is standing. This film can be used to determine the femoral and tibial anatomical axes and to estimate the biomechanical axes. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art these processes for identifying e.g. anatomical and mechanical axis of the joint can be applied to other joints without departing from the scope of the invention. Similarly the use of processed and or evaluated images or image groups as described in various locations herein can be utilized as an exemplary imaging source in for further use in designing manufacturing and or choosing appropriate implants as described in the various embodiments disclosed and discussed herein.

Anatomical and biomechanical axes can also be determined using other imaging modalities including but not limited to computed tomography and MRI. For example a CT scan can be obtained through the hip joint the knee joint and the ankle joint. Optionally the scan can be reformatted in the sagittal coronal or other planes. The CT images can then be utilized to identify anatomical landmarks and to determine the anatomical and biomechanical axes of the hip joint knee joint and or ankle joint.

Similarly an MRI scan can be obtained for this purpose. For example an MRI scan of the thigh and pelvic region can be obtained using a body coil or a torso phased array coil. A high resolution scan of the knee joint can be obtained using a dedicated extremity coil. A scan of the calf tibia region and the ankle joint can be obtained again using a body coil or a torso phased array coil. Anatomical landmarks can be identified in each joint on these scans and the anatomical and biomechanical axes can be estimated using this information.

In various embodiments the imaging scan can be extended for 5 cm more preferably 10 cm or more preferably 15 cm above and or below the joint thereby deriving anatomic information that can be used to derive the anatomic and mechanical axis. For example an MRI or CT scan can be obtained through a knee joint. The scan can extend 15 cm above and below the joint. The mid femoral line and mid tibial line as well as other anatomic landmarks such as the femoral transepicondylar line or Whiteside line or posterior condylar line can be determined and can be used to estimate the anatomic and biomechanical axes. Thus in the example of a knee joint no additional scanning through the hip joint and ankle joints will be needed.

With for example MRI even larger coverage may be obtained for example with a series of axial sagittal or coronal slices obtained with a large field of view e.g. 20 cm or more preferably 25 cm or more preferably 30 cm or more preferably 35 cm. These large field of view scans can be utilized to estimate the anatomic and biomechanical axes as described above. They lack however information on the surface detail of the joint due to limitations in spatial resolution. A second or additional scan can be performed with high resolution e.g. with spatial resolution and x and y axis of less than 1.0 mm or more preferably less than 0.8 mm or more preferably less than 0.6 mm. The additional high resolution scan may be utilized to derive the articular surface detail needed for a good and accurate fit between the guidance template or implant and the articular surface or adjacent structures.

A mechanical axis and in some instances an anatomical axis may advantageously be defined by imaging the entire extremity in question or through imaging combinations and or assessment as disclosed herein. Such imaging may include cross sectional spiral or volumetric imaging via a CT or MRI scan or optical imaging through the entire extremity or acquisition of select images or slices or volumes through an area of interest such as a hip joint a knee joint or ankle joint.

In an illustrative embodiment scans through the entire or portions of an entire extremity covering multiple joints may be replaced with an extended scan through a single joint such as a knee joint. For example it may not be sufficient to estimate a mechanical axis or an anatomical access with a standard knee scan such as a CT scan or MRI scan that includes for example only ten centimeter of the area or volume of interest above or ten centimeters of area or volume of interest below the tibiofemoral joints space. With an extended scan a larger area adjacent to the target joint can be included in the scan e.g. fifteen centimeters above and below the medial tibia femoral joint space twenty centimeters above and below the medial tibia femoral joint space fifteen centimeters above and twenty centimeters below the medial tibiofemoral joint space twenty centimeters above and twenty five centimeters below the medial tibiofemoral joint space. While the extended scan is less involved on the operative side than the scan involving the neighboring joints it can optionally be used to provide an estimate of the anatomical axis mechanical axis and or an implant axes or related planes. Thus better ease of use is provided at the expense of possibly more radiation and possibly less accuracy.

In another embodiment cross sectional or volumetric images such as CT scans or MRI scans may be acquired through more than one joint typically one or more joints neighboring the one contemplated for surgery. For example CT or MRI slices CT spirals CT or MRI volumes MRI two plane acquisitions with optional image fusion or other tomographic acquisitions are acquired through the hip joint knee joint and ankle joint in a patient scheduled for total knee replacement surgery. The 3D surgical guidance templates may be optimized by using anatomic and or biomechanical information obtained in the adjacent neighboring joints for example resulting in an improved anatomic or functional result. By using cross sectional or volumetric imaging information more accurate identification of anatomic landmarks for identifying relevant anatomical and or mechanical axis relevant planes including surgical planes and implant planes as well as implant axes can be achieved when compared to x rays or CT scout scans in particular when the cross sectional or volumetric data are acquired through neighboring joints. The accuracy of the position orientation shape or combinations thereof of a 3D guide template can thus be improved with resulting improvement in accuracy of the surgical correction of underlying deformities such as varus valgus abduction adduction or rotation deformities.

An imaging test obtained during weight bearing conditions has some inherent advantages in that it demonstrates normal as well as pathological loading and load distribution. A cross sectional imaging study such as a CT scan or MRI scan has some advantages because it allows one to visualize and demonstrate the anatomical landmarks in three rather than two dimensions thereby adding accuracy. Moreover measurements can be performed in other planes such as the sagittal or oblique planes that may not be easily accessible in certain anatomical regions using conventional radiography. In principle any imaging test can be utilized for this purpose.

The mechanical axis can be defined as the axis going from the center of the femoral head between the condylar surfaces and through the ankle joint The software may automatically semi automatically or manually assisted find or identify the relevant anatomic points to calculate the anatomic and biomechanical axes in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. For example the software or the user can find the center of the femoral head. Optionally this can be done in 3D rather than only in 2D. Thus for example in the femoral head the software can find the center of the femoral head relative to its x y and z dimensions. Alternatively the relevant anatomic points can be selected manually and the axes can be calculated.

In another embodiment the software can compute methods of adjusting varus or valgus or ante or retroversion deformity or rotational deformity based on such anatomic and mechanical axis measurements. For example the surface of a surgical guide template can be adapted so that surgical cuts performed for a total knee implant can be placed to correct an underlying varus or valgus deformity or for example ante or retroversion. Alternatively the openings cut planes of a surgical guide template used for drilling cutting and the like can be adjusted to achieve a varus or valgus correction to a near anatomic or physiologic range. These adjustments can be optimized for the implants of different manufacturers e.g. Johnson Johnson Stryker Smith Nephew Biomet and Zimmer.

In various embodiments gait loading and other physical activities of a joint as well as static joint positions may be simulated using a computer workstation. The template and its apertures and the resultant surgical templates and or procedures e.g. cuts drilling rasping may be optimized using this information to achieve an optimal functional result. For example the template and its apertures and the resultant implant position may be optimized for different degrees of flexion and extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction and ante or retroversion. Thus the templates may be used to achieve motion that is optimized in one two or more directions. Not only anatomic but also functional optimization is possible in this manner.

The origin and insertion of ligaments e.g. the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments in the case of a knee can be visualized on the scan. With MRI the ligaments are directly visible. If the ligament is torn the location of the residual fibers at the origin or attachment can be visualized. Different joint positions can then be simulated and changes in ligament length can be determined for different angles of flexion and extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction and ante or retroversion. These simulations can be performed without but also with the implant in place. Thus ligament length and through this presumed tension can be estimated virtually with any given implant and implant size. Different implants or component s can be tested preoperatively on the computer workstation and the implant or component s yielding the optimal ligament performance e.g. minimal change in ligament length for different joint positions can be determined pre operatively. Thus this disclosure provides among others for pre operative ligament balancing including but not limited to by directly visualizing the ligaments or fiber remnants.

For example in one embodiment a loading apparatus may be applied to the patient to simulate weight bearing while acquiring the CT scan. A non limiting example of such a loading apparatus has been described by Dynamed with the Dynawell device. Any loading apparatus that can apply axial or other physiologic or near physiologic loading forces on the hip knee or ankle joints or two or three of them may be used. Other more sophisticated scanning procedures can be used to derive this information without departing from the scope of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment when imaging a joint of the lower extremity a standing weight bearing x ray can be obtained to determine the mechanical axis. In the case of a knee or hip joint for example a standing weight bearing x ray of the hip joint or the knee joint can be obtained. Alternatively standing weight bearing x rays can be obtained spanning the entire leg from the hip to the foot. The x ray can be obtained in the antero posterior or posterior anterior projection but also in a lateral projection or principally any other projection that is desired. The user can measure the mechanical axis for example by finding the centroid of the femoral head and the centroid of the ankle joint and by connecting these. This measurement can be performed manually for example on a x ray film or electronically for example on a digitized or digital image including with software assistance. The axis measured on the standing weight bearing x ray can be cross referenced with another imaging modality such a CT or MRI scan. For example a mechanical axis can be determined on a standing x ray of the leg. The result and data can be cross referenced for example by identifying corresponding bony anatomical landmarks to a CT scan or MRI scan. The result and information can then be utilized to determine the optimal shape of a 3 D guidance template. Specifically the orientation position or shape of the template can be influenced based on the measurement of the mechanical axis. Moreover the position or shape of any blocks attached to said templates or linkages or the position or shape instruments attached to the mold block or linkages can be influenced by this measurement. Combining the standing weight bearing imaging modality with CT scanning or MRI scanning has the principle advantage that the joint is evaluated during physiological loading. CT or MRI alone typically do not afford assessment in loaded weight bearing condition. If desired other embodiments can use unloaded image data to simulate loaded weight bearing conditions of such joint.

As described above the mechanical axis can be evaluated in different planes or in three dimensions. For example the actual mechanical axis can be assessed in the AP plane and a desired mechanical axis can be determined in this plane. In addition the actual mechanical axis can be determined in the lateral plane for example in the lateral projection radiograph and the desired mechanical axis can be determined in the lateral plane. By measuring the relevant biomechanical and anatomical axis in two or more planes the shape of a 3 D guidance template and or implant can be further refined and optimized with result in improvements in clinical and patient function.

The biomechanical or anatomical axis may also be measured using other approaches including a non weight bearing position. For example anatomical landmarks can be identified on a CT scout scan and cross referenced to a joint such as a knee joint or a hip joint for which surgery is contemplated. Thus for example the user can measure and determine the centroid of the ankle joint and the centroid of the hip joint for knee surgery using the CT scout scan.

In a preferred embodiment the anatomical landmarks are determined using CT slices or MRI slices rather than a scout scan. A CT scout scan or MRI scout scan can have inherent limitations in spatial resolution. A CT scout scan is typically a single 2 D radiographic image of the extremity lacking 3 D anatomical information and lacking high spatial resolution. An MRI scout scan is typically composed of multiple 2 D MRI slices possibly acquired in one two or three planes. However the resolution of the MRI scout scan is typically also limited. By acquiring selective slices and even isotropic or near isotropic data sets through neighboring joints anatomical landmarks can be identified in a more reliable manner thereby improving the accuracy of anatomical and mechanical axis determination. This improvement in accuracy translates into an improvement in accuracy in the resultant 3 D guidance mold for example a knee or hip joint including improved accuracy of its shape orientation or position.

The angles of the anatomical structures of the proximal and distal femur also show a certain variability level i.e. standard deviation comparable with the varus or valgus angle or the angle between the anatomical femoral axis and the mechanical axis Mahaisavariya B Sitthiseripratip K Tongdee T Bohez E Sloten J V Oris P.

In one embodiment 2 D sagittal and coronal reconstructions of CT slice images are used to manually estimate the mechanical axis. One skilled in the art can easily recognize many different ways to automate this process. For example a CT scan covering at least the hip knee and ankle region is acquired. This results in image slices axial which can be interpolated to generate the sagittal and coronal views.

In addition to the various comparison evaluation steps disclosed herein preprocessing filtering of the slice images can be used to improve the contrast of the bone regions so that they can be extracted accurately using simple thresholding or a more involved image segmentation tool like LiveWire or active contour models.

Identification of landmarks of interest like the centroid of the tibial shaft the ankle joint the intercondylar notch and the centroid of the femoral head can be performed. The mechanical axis can be defined as the line connecting the proximal and the distal centroids i.e. the femoral head centroid the tibial or ankle joint centroid. The position of the intercondylar notch can be used for evaluation of possible deviations errors or deformations including varus and valgus deformity.

In various embodiments multiple imaging tests can be combined. For example the anatomical and biomechanical axes can be estimated using a weight bearing x ray of the extremity or portions of the extremity. The anatomical information derived in this fashion can then be combined with a CT or MRI scan of one or more joints such as a hip knee or ankle joint. Landmarks seen on radiography can then for example be cross referenced on the CT or MRI scan. Axis measurements performed on radiography can be subsequently applied to the CT or MRI scans or other imaging modalities. Similarly the information obtained from a CT scan can be compared with that obtained with an MRI or ultrasound scan.

In one embodiment image fusion of different imaging modalities can be performed. For example if surgery is contemplated in a knee joint a full length weight bearing x ray of the lower extremity can be obtained. This can be supplemented by a spiral CT scan optionally with intra articular contrast of the knee joint providing high resolution three dimensional anatomical characterization of the knee anatomy even including the menisci and cartilage. This information along with the axis information provided by the radiograph can be utilized to select or derive therapies such as implants or surgical instruments.

In certain embodiments it may be desirable to characterize the shape and dimension of intra articular structures including subchondral bone or the cartilage. This may be done for example by using a CT scan preferably a spiral CT scan of one or more joints. The spiral CT scan can optionally be performed using intra articular contrast. Alternatively an MRI scan can be performed. If CT is utilized a full spiral scan or a few selected slices can be obtained through neighboring joints. Typically a full spiral scan providing full three dimensional characterization would be obtained in the joint for which therapy is contemplated. If implants or templates for surgical instruments are selected or shaped using this scan the subchondral bone shape can be accurately determined from the resultant image data. A standard cartilage thickness and similarly a standard cartilage loss can be assumed in certain regions of the articular surface. For example a standard thickness of 2 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied to the subchondral bone in the anterior third of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. Similarly a standard thickness of 2 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied to the subchondral bone in the posterior third of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. A standard thickness of 0 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied in the central weight bearing zone of the medial condyle and a different value can be applied to the lateral condyle. The transition between these zones can be gradual for example from 2 mm to 0 mm. These standard values of estimated cartilage thickness and cartilage loss in different regions of the joint can optionally be derived from a reference database. The reference database can include categories such as age body mass index BMI severity of disease pain severity of varus deformity severity of valgus deformity Kellgren Lawrence score along with other parameters that are determined to be relative and useful. Use of a standard thickness for the articular cartilage can facilitate the imaging protocols required for pre operative planning.

Alternatively however the articular cartilage can be fully characterized by performing a spiral CT scan of the joint in the presence of intra articular contrast or by performing an MRI scan using cartilage sensitive pulse sequences.

The techniques described herein can be used to obtain an image of a joint that is stationary either weight bearing or not or in motion or combinations thereof. Imaging studies that are obtained during joint motion can be useful for assessing the load bearing surface. This can be advantageous for designing or selecting implants e.g. for selecting reinforcements in high load areas for surgical tools and for implant placement e.g. for optimizing implant alignment relative to high load areas.

In accordance with other embodiments a method and system for determining joint space width is provided. Without limitation a CT scan MRI scan optical scan and or ultrasound imaging is performed. The medial and lateral joint space width in a knee joint the joint space in a hip joint ankle joint or other joint is evaluated. This evaluation may be performed in two dimensions using a single scan plane orientation such as sagittal or coronal plane or it may be performed in three dimensions. The evaluation of joint space width may include measuring the distance from the subchondral bone plate of one articular surface to the subchondral bone plate of the opposing articular surface. Alternatively the cartilage thickness may be measured directly on one or more articular surfaces. Joint space width or cartilage thickness may be measured for different regions of the joint and joint space width and cartilage loss can be evaluated in anterior posterior medial lateral superior and or inferior positions. The measurements may be performed for different positions of the joint such as a neutral position 45 degrees of flexion 90 degrees of flexion 5 degrees of abduction 5 degrees of internal rotation and so forth. For example in a knee joint the joint space width may be evaluated in extension and at 25 degrees of knee flexion and 90 degrees of knee flexion. The medial and lateral joint space width may be compared and differences in medial and lateral joint space width can be utilized to optimize the desired postoperative correction in anatomical or mechanical axis alignment based on this information. The shape orientation or position of a 3D guided template may be adjusted using this information for example in knee or hip implant placement or other surgeries.

For example the measurement may show reduced joint space width or cartilage thickness in the medial compartment when compared to a normal anatomic reference standard e.g. from age or sex or gender matched controls and or lateral compartment. This can coincide with valgus alignment of the knee joint measured for example on the scout scan of a CT scan or the localizer scan of an MRI scan including multiple localizer scans through the hip knee and ankle joints.

If the mechanical axis estimated on the comparison of the medial and lateral joint space width coincides with the mechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout scan no further adjustment may be necessary. If the mechanical axis estimated on the comparison of the medial and lateral joint space width does not coincide with the mechanical axis of the extremity measured on the CT or MRI scout scan additional correction of the valgus deformity or in other embodiments varus or other deformities can be achieved.

This additional correction may be determined for example by adding the difference in axis correction desired based on mechanical axis measured by comparison of the medial lateral joint space width and axis correction desired based on measurement of the mechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout or localizer scan to axis correction desired based on measurement of the mechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout or localizer scan alone. By combining the information from both measurement of joint space width of the median and lateral compartment and measurement of the mechanical axis using the scout scan or localizer scan or for example a weight bearing x ray an improved assessment of axis alignment during load bearing conditions can be obtained with resultant improvements in the shape orientation or position of the 3D guidance template and related attachments or linkages.

Optionally the extremity can be loaded while in the scanner for example using a compression harness. Examples for compression harnesses have been published for example by Dynawell.

In another embodiment an imaging modality such as spiral CT spiral CT arthography MRI optical imaging optical coherence tomography ultrasound and others may be used to estimate cartilage loss in one two or three dimensions. The information can be used to determine a desired correction of a measured biomechanical or anatomical axis. The correction can be in the anterior posterior medio lateral and or super inferior direction or any other direction applicable or desirable or combinations thereof. The information can be combined with other data e.g. from a standing weight bearing x ray or CT scout scan or an MRI localizer scan or a CT scan or MRI scan that includes axial spiral or other images through the hip knee and ankle joints. The information can be used to refine the axis correction desired based on for example standing x rays non weight bearing x rays CT scout scans MRI localizer scans and the like.

In another embodiment any axis correction can be performed in a single plane e.g. the medial lateral plane in two planes e.g. the medial lateral and anterior posterior planes or multiple planes including oblique planes that are biomechanically or anatomically relevant or desirable.

Additional improvements in accuracy of the 3D guide template and or implants surfaces may be obtained with use of imaging technology that yields high spatial resolution not only within the imaging plane but along all three planes specifically the X Y and Z axis. With CT scanning this can be achieved with the advent of spiral CT Scanning techniques. With MRI dual or more plane scanning or volumetric acquisition can be performed. If dual or more plane MRI scanning is performed these multiple scan planes can be fused for example by cross registration and resampling along the X Y and Z axis. The resultant effective resolution in X Y and Z direction is greatly improved as compared to standard CT scanning or standard MRI scanning. Improvements in resolution have the advantage that the resultant 3D guide templates can be substantially more accurate for example with regard to their position shape or orientation.

Imaging modalities are subject to scan to scan variations for example including spatial distortion. In one embodiment phantom scans may be performed in order to optimize the scan quality specifically spatial resolution and spatial distortion. A phantom scan can be performed prior to a patient scan simultaneously with a patient scan or after a patient scan. Using the phantom scan data it is possible to make adjustments and optimizations of the scanner and moreover to perform image post processing to perform corrections for example correction of geometric distortions. Thus if a phantom scan detects certain geometric distortion in the X Y or Z axis and the amount of distortion is measured on the phantom scan a correction factor can be included in the data prior to generating a 3D guide template. The resulting 3D guide template is thus more accurate with resulting improvement in intra operative cross reference to the anatomic surface and resultant improved accuracy in any surgical intervention such as drilling or cutting.

In another embodiment a smoothing operation e.g. using low frequency filtering can be performed in order to remove any image related artifacts such as stepping artifacts between adjacent CT or MRI slices. In some applications the smoothing operation can be helpful in improving the fit between the joint and the template.

Alternatively or in addition to non invasive imaging techniques described above measurements of the size of an area of diseased cartilage or an area of cartilage loss measurements of cartilage thickness and or curvature of cartilage or bone can be obtained intraoperatively during arthroscopy or open arthrotomy. Intraoperative measurements can but need not involve actual contact with one or more areas of the articular surfaces.

Devices suitable for obtaining intraoperative measurements of cartilage or bone or other articular structures and to generate a topographical map of the surface include but are not limited to Placido disks optical measurements tools and device optical imaging tools and devices and laser interferometers and or deformable materials or devices. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 382 028 to Wooh et al. issued May 7 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 057 927 to Levesque et al. issued May 2 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 5 523 843 to Yamane et al. issued Jun. 4 1996 U.S. Pat. No. 5 847 804 to Sarver et al. issued Dec. 8 1998 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 684 562 to Fujieda issued Nov. 4 1997 .

Other devices to measure cartilage and subchondral bone intraoperatively include for example ultrasound probes. An ultrasound probe preferably handheld can be applied to the cartilage and the curvature of the cartilage and or the subchondral bone can be measured. Moreover the size of a cartilage defect can be assessed and the thickness of the articular cartilage can be determined. Such ultrasound measurements can be obtained in A mode B mode or C mode. If A mode measurements are obtained an operator can typically repeat the measurements with several different probe orientations e.g. mediolateral and anteroposterior in order to derive a three dimensional assessment of size curvature and thickness.

One skilled in the art will easily recognize that different probe designs are possible using the optical laser interferometry mechanical and ultrasound probes. The probes are preferably handheld. In certain embodiments the probes or at least a portion of the probe typically the portion that is in contact with the tissue can be sterile. Sterility can be achieved with use of sterile covers for example similar to those disclosed in WO 99 08598A1 to Lang published Feb. 25 1999.

Analysis on the curvature of the articular cartilage or subchondral bone using imaging tests and or intraoperative measurements can be used to determine the size of an area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss. For example the curvature can change abruptly in areas of cartilage loss. Such abrupt or sudden changes in curvature can be used to detect the boundaries of diseased cartilage or cartilage defects.

As described above measurements can be made while the joint is stationary either weight bearing or not or in motion.

A wide variety of materials find use in the practice of the present invention including but not limited to plastics metals crystal free metals ceramics biological materials e.g. collagen or other extracellular matrix materials hydroxyapatite cells e.g. stem cells chondrocyte cells or the like or combinations thereof. Based on the information e.g. measurements obtained regarding the defect and the articular surface and or the subchondral bone a repair material can be formed or selected. Further using one or more of these techniques described herein a cartilage replacement or regenerating material having a curvature that will fit into a particular cartilage defect will follow the contour and shape of the articular surface and will match the thickness of the surrounding cartilage. The repair material can include any combination of materials and typically include at least one non pliable material for example materials that are not easily bent or changed.

Currently joint repair systems often employ metal and or polymeric materials including for example prostheses which are anchored into the underlying bone e.g. a femur in the case of a knee prosthesis . See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 203 576 to Afriat et al. issued Mar. 20 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 322 588 to Ogle et al. issued Nov. 27 2001 and references cited therein. A wide variety of metals are useful in the practice of the present invention and can be selected based on any criteria. For example material selection can be based on resiliency to impart a desired degree of rigidity. Non limiting examples of suitable metals include silver gold platinum palladium iridium copper tin lead antimony bismuth zinc titanium cobalt stainless steel nickel iron alloys cobalt alloys such as Elgiloy a cobalt chromium nickel alloy and MP35N a nickel cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy and Nitinol a nickel titanium alloy aluminum manganese iron tantalum crystal free metals such as Liquidmetal alloys available from LiquidMetal Technologies www.liquidmetal.com other metals that can slowly form polyvalent metal ions for example to inhibit calcification of implanted substrates in contact with a patient s bodily fluids or tissues and combinations thereof.

Suitable synthetic polymers include without limitation polyamides e.g. nylon polyesters polystyrenes polyacrylates vinyl polymers e.g. polyethylene polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride polycarbonates polyurethanes poly dimethyl siloxanes cellulose acetates polymethyl methacrylates polyether ether ketones ethylene vinyl acetates polysulfones nitrocelluloses similar copolymers and mixtures thereof. Bioresorbable synthetic polymers can also be used such as dextran hydroxyethyl starch derivatives of gelatin polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol poly N 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide poly hydroxy acids poly epsilon caprolactone polylactic acid polyglycolic acid poly dimethyl glycolic acid poly hydroxy butyrate and similar copolymers can also be used.

Other materials would also be appropriate for example the polyketone known as polyetheretherketone PEEK . This includes the material PEEK 450G which is an unfilled PEEK approved for medical implantation available from Victrex of Lancashire Great Britain. Victrex is located at www.matweb.com or see Boedeker www.boedeker.com . Other sources of this material include Gharda located in Panoli India www.ghardapolymers.com .

It should be noted that the material selected can also be filled. For example other grades of PEEK are also available and contemplated such as 30 glass filled or 30 carbon filled provided such materials are cleared for use in implantable devices by the FDA or other regulatory body. Glass filled PEEK reduces the expansion rate and increases the flexural modulus of PEEK relative to that portion which is unfilled. The resulting product is known to be ideal for improved strength stiffness or stability. Carbon filled PEEK is known to enhance the compressive strength and stiffness of PEEK and lower its expansion rate. Carbon filled PEEK offers wear resistance and load carrying capability.

As will be appreciated other suitable similarly biocompatible thermoplastic or thermoplastic polycondensate materials that resist fatigue have good memory are flexible and or deflectable have very low moisture absorption and good wear and or abrasion resistance can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. The implant can also be comprised of polyetherketoneketone PEKK .

Other materials that can be used include polyetherketone PEK polyetherketoneetherketoneketone PEKEKK and polyetheretherketoneketone PEEKK and generally a polyaryletheretherketone. Further other polyketones can be used as well as other thermoplastics.

Reference to appropriate polymers that can be used for the implant can be made to the following documents all of which are incorporated herein by reference. These documents include PCT Publication WO 02 02158 A1 dated Jan. 10 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials PCT Publication WO 02 00275 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials and PCT Publication WO 02 00270 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials.

The polymers can be prepared by any of a variety of approaches including conventional polymer processing methods. Preferred approaches include for example injection molding which is suitable for the production of polymer components with significant structural features and rapid prototyping approaches such as reaction injection molding and stereo lithography. The substrate can be textured or made porous by either physical abrasion or chemical alteration to facilitate incorporation of the metal coating. Other processes are also appropriate such as extrusion injection compression molding and or machining techniques. Typically the polymer is chosen for its physical and mechanical properties and is suitable for carrying and spreading the physical load between the joint surfaces.

More than one metal and or polymer can be used in combination with each other. For example one or more metal containing substrates can be coated with polymers in one or more regions or alternatively one or more polymer containing substrate can be coated in one or more regions with one or more metals.

The system or prosthesis can be porous or porous coated. The porous surface components can be made of various materials including metals ceramics and polymers. These surface components can in turn be secured by various means to a multitude of structural cores formed of various metals. Suitable porous coatings include but are not limited to metal ceramic polymeric e.g. biologically neutral elastomers such as silicone rubber polyethylene terephthalate and or combinations thereof or combinations thereof. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 605 123 to Hahn issued Sep. 20 1971. U.S. Pat. No. 3 808 606 to Tronzo issued May 7 1974 and U.S. Pat. No. 3 843 975 to Tronzo issued Oct. 29 1974 U.S. Pat. No. 3 314 420 to Smith issued Apr. 18 1967 U.S. Pat. No. 3 987 499 to Scharbach issued Oct. 26 1976 and German Offenlegungsschrift 2 306 552. There can be more than one coating layer and the layers can have the same or different porosities. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 938 198 to Kahn et al. issued Feb. 17 1976.

The coating can be applied by surrounding a core with powdered polymer and heating until cured to form a coating with an internal network of interconnected pores. The tortuosity of the pores e.g. a measure of length to diameter of the paths through the pores can be important in evaluating the probable success of such a coating in use on a prosthetic device. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4 213 816 to Morris issued Jul. 22 1980. The porous coating can be applied in the form of a powder and the article as a whole subjected to an elevated temperature that bonds the powder to the substrate. Selection of suitable polymers and or powder coatings can be determined in view of the teachings and references cited herein for example based on the melt index of each.

Repair materials can also include one or more biological material either alone or in combination with non biological materials. For example any base material can be designed or shaped and suitable cartilage replacement or regenerating material s such as fetal cartilage cells can be applied to be the base. The cells can be then be grown in conjunction with the base until the thickness and or curvature of the cartilage surrounding the cartilage defect has been reached. Conditions for growing cells e.g. chondrocytes on various substrates in culture ex vivo and in vivo are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 739 to Slivka et al. issued Dec. 26 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 842 477 to Naughton et al. issued Dec. 1 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 6 283 980 to Vibe Hansen et al. issued Sep. 4 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 405 to Salzmann et al. issued Apr. 2 2002. Non limiting examples of suitable substrates include plastic tissue scaffold a bone replacement material e.g. a hydroxyapatite a bioresorbable material or any other material suitable for growing a cartilage replacement or regenerating material on it.

Biological polymers can be naturally occurring or produced in vitro by fermentation and the like. Suitable biological polymers include without limitation collagen elastin silk keratin gelatin polyamino acids cat gut sutures polysaccharides e.g. cellulose and starch and mixtures thereof. Biological polymers can be bioresorbable.

Biological materials used in the methods described herein can be autografts from the same subject allografts from another individual of the same species and or xenografts from another species . See also International Patent Publications WO 02 22014 to Alexander et al. published Mar. 21 2002 and WO 97 27885 to Lee published Aug. 7 1997. In certain embodiments autologous materials are preferred as they can carry a reduced risk of immunological complications to the host including re absorption of the materials inflammation and or scarring of the tissues surrounding the implant site.

In one embodiment a probe is used to harvest tissue from a donor site and to prepare a recipient site. The donor site can be located in a xenograft an allograft or an autograft. The probe is used to achieve a good anatomic match between the donor tissue sample and the recipient site. The probe is specifically designed to achieve a seamless or near seamless match between the donor tissue sample and the recipient site. The probe can for example be cylindrical. The distal end of the probe is typically sharp in order to facilitate tissue penetration. Additionally the distal end of the probe is typically hollow in order to accept the tissue. The probe can have an edge at a defined distance from its distal end e.g. at 1 cm distance from the distal end and the edge can be used to achieve a defined depth of tissue penetration for harvesting. The edge can be external or can be inside the hollow portion of the probe. For example an orthopedic surgeon can take the probe and advance it with physical pressure into the cartilage the subchondral bone and the underlying marrow in the case of a joint such as a knee joint. The surgeon can advance the probe until the external or internal edge reaches the cartilage surface. At that point the edge will prevent further tissue penetration thereby achieving a constant and reproducible tissue penetration. The distal end of the probe can include one or more blades saw like structures or tissue cutting mechanism. For example the distal end of the probe can include an iris like mechanism consisting of several small blades. The blade or blades can be moved using a manual motorized or electrical mechanism thereby cutting through the tissue and separating the tissue sample from the underlying tissue. Typically this will be repeated in the donor and the recipient. In the case of an iris shaped blade mechanism the individual blades can be moved so as to close the iris thereby separating the tissue sample from the donor site.

In another embodiment a laser device or a radiofrequency device can be integrated inside the distal end of the probe. The laser device or the radiofrequency device can be used to cut through the tissue and to separate the tissue sample from the underlying tissue.

In one embodiment the same probe can be used in the donor and in the recipient. In another embodiment similarly shaped probes of slightly different physical dimensions can be used. For example the probe used in the recipient can be slightly smaller than that used in the donor thereby achieving a tight fit between the tissue sample or tissue transplant and the recipient site. The probe used in the recipient can also be slightly shorter than that used in the donor thereby correcting for any tissue lost during the separation or cutting of the tissue sample from the underlying tissue in the donor material.

Any biological repair material can be sterilized to inactivate biological contaminants such as bacteria viruses yeasts molds mycoplasmas and parasites. Sterilization can be performed using any suitable technique for example radiation such as gamma radiation.

Any of the biological materials described herein can be harvested with use of a robotic device. The robotic device can use information from an electronic image for tissue harvesting.

In certain embodiments the cartilage replacement material has a particular biochemical composition. For instance the biochemical composition of the cartilage surrounding a defect can be assessed by taking tissue samples and chemical analysis or by imaging techniques. For example WO 02 22014 to Alexander describes the use of gadolinium for imaging of articular cartilage to monitor glycosaminoglycan content within the cartilage. The cartilage replacement or regenerating material can then be made or cultured in a manner to achieve a biochemical composition similar to that of the cartilage surrounding the implantation site. The culture conditions used to achieve the desired biochemical compositions can include for example varying concentrations. Biochemical composition of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material can for example be influenced by controlling concentrations and exposure times of certain nutrients and growth factors.

Using information on thickness and curvature of the cartilage a physical model of the surfaces of the articular cartilage and of the underlying bone can be created. This physical model can be representative of a limited area within the joint or it can encompass the entire joint. For example in the knee joint the physical model can encompass only the medial or lateral femoral condyle both femoral condyles and the notch region the medial tibial plateau the lateral tibial plateau the entire tibial plateau the medial patella the lateral patella the entire patella or the entire joint. The location of a diseased area of cartilage can be determined for example using a 3D coordinate system or a 3D Euclidian distance as described in WO 02 22014.

In this way the size of the defect to be repaired can be determined. As will be apparent some but not all defects will include less than the entire cartilage. Thus in one embodiment the thickness of the normal or only mildly diseased cartilage surrounding one or more cartilage defects is measured. This thickness measurement can be obtained at a single point or preferably at multiple points for example 2 point 4 6 points 7 10 points more than 10 points or over the length of the entire remaining cartilage. Furthermore once the size of the defect is determined an appropriate therapy e.g. articular repair system can be selected such that as much as possible of the healthy surrounding tissue is preserved.

In other embodiments the curvature of the articular surface can be measured to design and or shape the repair material. Further both the thickness of the remaining cartilage and the curvature of the articular surface can be measured to design and or shape the repair material. Alternatively the curvature of the subchondral bone can be measured and the resultant measurement s can be used to either select or shape a cartilage replacement material. For example the contour of the subchondral bone can be used to re create a virtual cartilage surface the margins of an area of diseased cartilage can be identified. The subchondral bone shape in the diseased areas can be measured. A virtual contour can then be created by copying the subchondral bone surface into the cartilage surface whereby the copy of the subchondral bone surface connects the margins of the area of diseased cartilage.

Turning now to various stages of knee resurfacing steps are shown. illustrates an example of normal thickness cartilage in the anterior central and posterior portion of a femoral condyle with a cartilage defect in the posterior portion of the femoral condyle. shows the detection of a sudden change in thickness indicating the margins of a cartilage defect that would be observed using the imaging techniques or the mechanical optical laser or ultrasound techniques described above. shows the margins of a weight bearing surface mapped onto the articular cartilage . Cartilage defect is located within the weight bearing surface .

By providing a softer first component and a firmer second component the overall implant can be configured so that its relative hardness is analogous to that of the bone cartilage or bone meniscus area that it abuts. Thus the softer material first component being formed of a softer material could perform the cushioning function of the nearby meniscus or cartilage.

Now turning to these figures depict exemplary knee imaging and resurfacing processes. depicts a magnified view of an area of diseased cartilage demonstrating decreased cartilage thickness when compared to the surrounding normal cartilage . The margins of the defect have been determined. depicts the measurement of cartilage thickness adjacent to the defect . depicts the placement of a multi component mini prosthesis for articular resurfacing. The thickness of the first component closely approximates that of the adjacent normal cartilage . The thickness can vary in different regions of the prosthesis. The curvature of the distal portion of the first component closely approximates an extension of the normal cartilage surrounding the defect. The curvature of the distal portion of the second component is a projection of the surface of the adjacent subchondral bone and can have a curvature that is the same or substantially similar to all or part of the surrounding subchondral bone.

In another embodiment a container or well can be formed to the selected specifications for example to match the material needed for a particular subject or to create a stock of repair materials in a variety of sizes. The size and shape of the container can be designed using the thickness and curvature information obtained from the joint and from the cartilage defect. More specifically the inside of the container can be shaped to follow any selected measurements for example as obtained from the cartilage defect s of a particular subject. The container can be filled with a cartilage replacement or regenerating material for example collagen containing materials plastics bioresorbable materials and or any suitable tissue scaffold. The cartilage regenerating or replacement material can also consist of a suspension of stem cells or fetal or immature or mature cartilage cells that subsequently develop to more mature cartilage inside the container. Further development and or differentiation can be enhanced with use of certain tissue nutrients and growth factors.

The material is allowed to harden and or grow inside the container until the material has the desired traits for example thickness elasticity hardness biochemical composition etc. Molds can be generated using any suitable technique for example computer devices and automation e.g. computer assisted design CAD and for example computer assisted modeling CAM . Because the resulting material generally follows the contour of the inside of the container it will better fit the defect itself and facilitate integration.

Examples of one component systems include but are not limited to a plastic a polymer a metal a metal alloy crystal free metals a biologic material or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone can be smooth. In other embodiments the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone can be porous or porous coated. In another aspect the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone is designed with one or more grooves for example to facilitate the in growth of the surrounding tissue. The external surface of the device can have a step like design which can be advantageous for altering biomechanical stresses. Optionally flanges can also be added at one or more positions on the device e.g. to prevent the repair system from rotating to control toggle and or prevent settling into the marrow cavity . The flanges can be part of a conical or a cylindrical design. A portion or all of the repair system facing the underlying bone can also be flat which can help to control depth of the implant and to prevent toggle.

Non limiting examples of multiple component systems include combinations of metal plastic metal alloys crystal free metals and one or more biological materials. One or more components of the articular surface repair system can be composed of a biologic material e.g. a tissue scaffold with cells such as cartilage cells or stem cells alone or seeded within a substrate such as a bioresorable material or a tissue scaffold allograft autograft or combinations thereof and or a non biological material e.g. polyethylene or a chromium alloy such as chromium cobalt .

One or more regions of the articular surface repair system e.g. the outer margin of the first portion and or the second portion can be bioresorbable for example to allow the interface between the articular surface repair system and the patient s normal cartilage over time to be filled in with hyaline or fibrocartilage. Similarly one or more regions e.g. the outer margin of the first portion of the articular surface repair system and or the second portion can be porous. The degree of porosity can change throughout the porous region linearly or non linearly for where the degree of porosity will typically decrease towards the center of the articular surface repair system. The pores can be designed for in growth of cartilage cells cartilage matrix and connective tissue thereby achieving a smooth interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding cartilage.

The repair system e.g. the second component in multiple component systems can be attached to the patient s bone with use of a cement like material such as methylmethacrylate injectable hydroxy or calcium apatite materials and the like.

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the articular surface repair system can be pliable or liquid or deformable at the time of implantation and can harden later. Hardening can occur for example within 1 second to 2 hours or any time period therebetween preferably with in 1 second to 30 minutes or any time period therebetween more preferably between 1 second and 10 minutes or any time period therebetween .

One or more components of the articular surface repair system can be adapted to receive injections. For example the external surface of the articular surface repair system can have one or more openings therein. The openings can be sized to receive screws tubing needles or other devices which can be inserted and advanced to the desired depth for example through the articular surface repair system into the marrow space. Injectables such as methylmethacrylate and injectable hydroxy or calcium apatite materials can then be introduced through the opening or tubing inserted therethrough into the marrow space thereby bonding the articular surface repair system with the marrow space. Similarly screws or pins or other anchoring mechanisms can be inserted into the openings and advanced to the underlying subchondral bone and the bone marrow or epiphysis to achieve fixation of the articular surface repair system to the bone. Portions or all components of the screw or pin can be bioresorbable for example the distal portion of a screw that protrudes into the marrow space can be bioresorbable. During the initial period after the surgery the screw can provide the primary fixation of the articular surface repair system. Subsequently ingrowth of bone into a porous coated area along the undersurface of the articular cartilage repair system can take over as the primary stabilizer of the articular surface repair system against the bone.

The articular surface repair system can be anchored to the patient s bone with use of a pin or screw or other attachment mechanism. The attachment mechanism can be bioresorbable. The screw or pin or attachment mechanism can be inserted and advanced towards the articular surface repair system from a non cartilage covered portion of the bone or from a non weight bearing surface of the joint. The anchoring component e.g. pegs pins can have a porous structure or porous coating to facilitate bone in growth. For example a peg or pin can have a porous structure through its cross sectional diameter such that it can be readily sawed through when desired e.g. removing an existing implant in a patient to prepare for a revision surgery.

The interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage can be at an angle for example oriented at an angle of 90 degrees relative to the underlying subchondral bone. Suitable angles can be determined in view of the teachings herein and in certain cases non 90 degree angles can have advantages with regard to load distribution along the interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage.

The interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage and or bone can be covered with a pharmaceutical or bioactive agent for example a material that stimulates the biological integration of the repair system into the normal cartilage and or bone. The surface area of the interface can be irregular for example to increase exposure of the interface to pharmaceutical or bioactive agents.

As described herein repair systems including surgical instruments templates guides and or molds of various sizes curvatures and thicknesses can be derived designed or otherwise obtained. These repair systems including surgical instruments guides templates and or molds can be catalogued and stored to create a library of systems from which an appropriate system for an individual patient can then be selected. In other words a defect or an articular surface is assessed in a particular subject and a pre existing repair system including surgical instruments templates guides and or molds having a suitable shape and size is selected from the library for further manipulation e.g. shaping and implantation.

As noted above the methods and compositions described herein can be used to replace only a portion of the articular surface for example an area of diseased cartilage or lost cartilage on the articular surface. In these systems the articular surface repair system can be designed to replace only the area of diseased or lost cartilage or it can extend beyond the area of diseased or lost cartilage e.g. 3 or 5 mm into normal adjacent cartilage. In certain embodiments the prosthesis replaces less than about 70 to 80 or any value therebetween of the articular surface e.g. any given articular surface such as a single femoral condyle etc. preferably less than about 50 to 70 or any value therebetween more preferably less than about 30 to 50 or any value therebetween more preferably less than about 20 to 30 or any value therebetween even more preferably less than about 20 of the articular surface.

The prosthesis can include multiple components for example a component that is implanted into the bone e.g. a metallic device attached to a component that is shaped to cover the defect of the cartilage overlaying the bone. Additional components for example intermediate plates meniscal repair systems and the like can also be included. It is contemplated that each component replaces less than all of the corresponding articular surface. However each component need not replace the same portion of the articular surface. In other words the prosthesis can have a bone implanted component that replaces less than 30 of the bone and a cartilage component that replaces 60 of the cartilage. The prosthesis can include any combination provided each component replaces less than the entire articular surface.

The articular surface repair system can be formed or selected so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage. Typically the articular surface repair system is formed and or selected so that its outer margin located at the external surface will be aligned with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage.

Thus the articular repair system can be designed to replace the weight bearing portion or more or less than the weight bearing portion of an articular surface for example in a femoral condyle. The weight bearing surface refers to the contact area between two opposing articular surfaces during activities of normal daily living e.g. normal gait . At least one or more weight bearing portions can be replaced in this manner e.g. on a femoral condyle and on a tibia.

In other embodiments an area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss can be identified in a weight bearing area and only a portion of the weight bearing area specifically the portion containing the diseased cartilage or area of cartilage loss can be replaced with an articular surface repair system.

In another embodiment the articular repair system can be designed or selected to replace substantially all of the articular surface e.g. a condyle.

In another embodiment for example in patients with diffuse cartilage loss the articular repair system can be designed to replace an area slightly larger than the weight bearing surface.

In certain aspects the defect to be repaired is located only on one articular surface typically the most diseased surface. For example in a patient with severe cartilage loss in the medial femoral condyle but less severe disease in the tibia the articular surface repair system can only be applied to the medial femoral condyle. Preferably in any methods described herein the articular surface repair system is designed to achieve an exact or a near anatomic fit with the adjacent normal cartilage.

In other embodiments more than one articular surface can be repaired. The area s of repair will be typically limited to areas of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss or areas slightly greater than the area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss within the weight bearing surface s .

The implant and or the implant site can be sculpted to achieve a near anatomic alignment between the implant and the implant site. In another embodiment an electronic image is used to measure the thickness curvature or shape of the articular cartilage or the subchondral bone and or the size of a defect and an articular surface repair system is selected using this information. The articular surface repair system can be inserted arthroscopically. The articular surface repair system can have a single radius. More typically however the articular surface repair system has varying curvatures and radii within the same plane e.g. anteroposterior or mediolateral or superoinferior or oblique planes or within multiple planes. In this manner the articular surface repair system can be shaped to achieve a near anatomic alignment between the implant and the implant site. This design allows not only allows for different degrees of convexity or concavity but also for concave portions within a predominantly convex shape or vice versa.

In another embodiment the articular surface repair system has an anchoring stem used to anchor the device for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 224 632 to Pappas et al issued May 1 2001. The stem or peg can have different shapes including conical rectangular fin among others. The mating bone cavity is typically similarly shaped as the corresponding stem.

As shown in discussed above the articular surface repair system can be affixed to the subchondral bone with one or more stems or pegs extending through the subchondral plate into the marrow space. In certain instances this design can reduce the likelihood that the implant will settle deeper into the joint over time by resting portions of the implant against the subchondral bone. The stems or pegs can be of any shape suitable to perform the function of anchoring the device to the bone. For example the pegs can be cylindrical or conical. Optionally the stems or pegs can further include notches or openings or other porous structures to allow bone in growth. In addition the stems can be porous coated for bone in growth. The anchoring mechanisms such as stems or pegs with porous structures can be readily sawed through when desired e.g. removing an existing implant in a patient to prepare for a revision surgery.

The anchoring stems or pegs can be affixed to the bone using bone cement. An additional anchoring device can also be affixed to the stem or peg. The anchoring device can have an umbrella shape e.g. radially expanding elements with the wider portion pointing towards the subchondral bone and away from the peg. The anchoring device can be advantageous for providing immediate fixation of the implant. The undersurface of the articular repair system facing the subchondral bone can be textured or rough thereby increasing the contact surface between the articular repair system and the subchondral bone. Alternatively the undersurface of the articular repair system can be porous coated thereby allowing in growth. The surgeon can support the in growth of bone by treating the subchondral bone with a rasp typically to create a larger surface area and or until bleeding from the subchondral bone occurs.

In another embodiment the articular surface repair system can be attached to the underlying bone or bone marrow using bone cement. Bone cement is typically made from an acrylic polymeric material. Typically the bone cement is comprised of two components a dry powder component and a liquid component which are subsequently mixed together. The dry component generally includes an acrylic polymer such as polymethylmethacrylate PMMA . The dry component can also contain a polymerization initiator such as benzoylperoxide which initiates the free radical polymerization process that occurs when the bone cement is formed. The liquid component on the other hand generally contains a liquid monomer such as methyl methacrylate MMA . The liquid component can also contain an accelerator such as an amine e.g. N N dimethyl p toluidine . A stabilizer such as hydroquinone can also be added to the liquid component to prevent premature polymerization of the liquid monomer. When the liquid component is mixed with the dry component the dry component begins to dissolve or swell in the liquid monomer. The amine accelerator reacts with the initiator to form free radicals that begin to link monomer units to form polymer chains. In the next two to four minutes the polymerization process proceeds changing the viscosity of the mixture from a syrup like consistency low viscosity into a dough like consistency high viscosity . Ultimately further polymerization and curing occur causing the cement to harden and affix a prosthesis to a bone.

In certain aspects bone cement or another liquid attachment material such as injectable calciumhydroxyapatite can be injected into the marrow cavity through one or more openings in the prosthesis. These openings in the prosthesis can extend from the articular surface to the undersurface of the prosthesis. After injection the openings can be closed with a polymer silicon metal metal alloy or bioresorbable plug.

In another embodiment one or more components of the articular surface repair e.g. the surface of the system that is pointing towards the underlying bone or bone marrow can be porous or porous coated. A variety of different porous metal coatings have been proposed for enhancing fixation of a metallic prosthesis by bone tissue in growth. Thus for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 855 638 to Pilliar issued Dec. 24 2974 discloses a surgical prosthetic device which can be used as a bone prosthesis comprising a composite structure consisting of a solid metallic material substrate and a porous coating of the same solid metallic material adhered to and extending over at least a portion of the surface of the substrate. The porous coating consists of a plurality of small discrete particles of metallic material bonded together at their points of contact with each other to define a plurality of connected interstitial pores in the coating. The size and spacing of the particles which can be distributed in a plurality of monolayers can be such that the average interstitial pore size is not more than about 200 microns. Additionally the pore size distribution can be substantially uniform from the substrate coating interface to the surface of the coating. In another embodiment the articular surface repair system can contain one or more polymeric materials that can be loaded with and release therapeutic agents including drugs or other pharmacological treatments that can be used for drug delivery. The polymeric materials can for example be placed inside areas of porous coating. The polymeric materials can be used to release therapeutic drugs e.g. bone or cartilage growth stimulating drugs. This embodiment can be combined with other embodiments wherein portions of the articular surface repair system can be bioresorbable. For example the first layer of an articular surface repair system or portions of its first layer can be bioresorbable. As the first layer gets increasingly resorbed local release of a cartilage growth stimulating drug can facilitate in growth of cartilage cells and matrix formation.

In any of the methods or compositions described herein the articular surface repair system can be pre manufactured with a range of sizes curvatures and thicknesses. Alternatively the articular surface repair system can be custom made for an individual patient.

In certain instances shaping of the repair material will be required before or after formation e.g. growth to desired thickness for example where the thickness of the required cartilage material is not uniform e.g. where different sections of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material require different thicknesses .

The replacement material can be shaped by any suitable technique including but not limited to mechanical abrasion laser abrasion or ablation radiofrequency treatment cryoablation variations in exposure time and concentration of nutrients enzymes or growth factors and any other means suitable for influencing or changing cartilage thickness. See e.g. WO 00 15153 to Mansmann published Mar. 23 2000 If enzymatic digestion is used certain sections of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material can be exposed to higher doses of the enzyme or can be exposed longer as a means of achieving different thicknesses and curvatures of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material in different sections of said material.

The material can be shaped manually and or automatically for example using a device into which a pre selected thickness and or curvature has been input and then programming the device using the input information to achieve the desired shape.

In addition to or instead of shaping the cartilage repair material the site of implantation e.g. bone surface any cartilage material remaining etc. can also be shaped by any suitable technique in order to enhance integration of the repair material.

The articular repair system can be formed or selected so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci and other tissue. The shape of the repair system can be based on the analysis of an electronic image e.g. MRI CT digital tomosynthesis optical coherence tomography or the like . If the articular repair system is intended to replace an area of diseased cartilage or lost cartilage the near anatomic fit can be achieved using a method that provides a virtual reconstruction of the shape of healthy cartilage in an electronic image or alternatively the shape of the failed implant it replaces.

In one embodiment a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect can be reconstructed by interpolating the healthy cartilage surface across the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. This can for example be achieved by describing the healthy cartilage by means of a parametric surface e.g. a B spline surface for which the control points are placed such that the parametric surface follows the contour of the healthy cartilage and bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. The continuity properties of the parametric surface will provide a smooth integration of the part that bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage with the contour of the surrounding healthy cartilage. The part of the parametric surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage.

In another embodiment a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be reconstructed using morphological image processing. In a first step the cartilage can be extracted from the electronic image using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques e.g. manual tracing region growing live wire model based segmentation resulting in a binary image. Defects in the cartilage appear as indentations that can be filled with a morphological closing operation performed in 2 D or 3 D with an appropriately selected structuring element. The closing operation is typically defined as a dilation followed by an erosion. A dilation operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if at least one pixel of the structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. An erosion operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if the whole structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. The filling of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage creates a new surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage that can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone.

As described above the articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. can be formed or selected from a library or database of systems of various sizes curvatures and thicknesses so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage and or subchondral bone. These systems can be pre made or made to order for an individual patient. In order to control the fit or match of the articular repair system with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci and other tissues preoperatively a software program can be used that projects the articular repair system over the anatomic position where it will be implanted. Suitable software is commercially available and or readily modified or designed by a skilled programmer.

In yet another embodiment the articular repair system including unicompartmental and total knee implants as well as hip devices can be projected over the implantation site using one or more 2 D or 3 D images. The cartilage and or subchondral bone and other anatomic structures can be optionally extracted from a 2 D or 3 D electronic image such as an MRI or a CT using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques. A 2 D or 3 D representation of the cartilage and or bone and other anatomic structures as well as the articular repair system can be generated for example using a polygon or NURBS surface or other parametric surface representation. Ligaments menisci and other articular structures can be displayed in 2 D and 3 D. For a description of various parametric surface representations see for example Foley J. D. et al. Computer Graphics Principles and Practice in C Addison Wesley 2edition 1995 .

The 2 D or 3 D representations of the cartilage and or subchondral bone and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system can be merged into a common coordinate system. The articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The representations of the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system are rendered into a 2 D or 3 D image for example application programming interfaces APIs OpenGL standard library of advanced 3 D graphics functions developed by SGI Inc. available as part of the drivers for PC based video cards for example from www.nvidia.com for NVIDIA video cards or www.3dlabs.com for 3Dlabs products or as part of the system software for Unix workstations or DirectX multimedia API for Microsoft Windows based PC systems available from www.microsoft.com . The 2 D or 3 D image can be rendered or displayed showing the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci or other anatomic objects and the articular repair system from varying angles e.g. by rotating or moving them interactively or non interactively in real time or non real time.

In another embodiment the implantation site may be visualized using one or more cross sectional 2 D images as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 305 652 entitled Methods and Compositions for Articular Repair filed Nov. 27 2002 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Typically a series of 2 D cross sectional images will be used. The 2 D images can be generated with imaging tests such as CT MRI digital tomosynthesis ultrasound optical imaging optical coherence tomography other imaging modalities using methods and tools known to those of skill in the art. The articular repair system or implant can then be superimposed onto one or more of these 2 D images. The 2 D cross sectional images may be reconstructed in other planes e.g. from sagittal to coronal etc. Isotropic data sets e.g. data sets where the slice thickness is the same or nearly the same as the in plane resolution or near isotropic data sets can also be used. Multiple planes may be displayed simultaneously for example using a split screen display. The operator may also scroll through the 2 D images in any desired orientation in real time or near real time the operator can rotate the imaged tissue volume while doing this. The articular repair system or implant may be displayed in cross section utilizing different display planes e.g. sagittal coronal or axial typically matching those of the 2 D images demonstrating the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci or other tissue. Alternatively a three dimensional display may be used for the articular repair system. The 2 D electronic image and the 2 D or 3 D representation of the articular repair system or implant may be merged into a common coordinate system. The cartilage repair system or implant can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The series of 2 D cross sections of the anatomic structures the implantation site and the articular repair system or implant may be displayed interactively e.g. the operator can scroll through a series of slices or non interactively e.g. as an animation that moves through the series of slices in real time or non real time.

The software can be designed so that the articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. with the best fit relative to the cartilage and or subchondral bone is automatically selected for example using one or more of the techniques described above. Alternatively the operator can select an articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. and project it or drag it onto the implantation site displayed on the cross sectional 2 D or the 3 D images. The operator can then move and rotate the articular repair system relative to the implantation site and scroll through a cross sectional 2 D or 3 D display of the articular repair system and of the anatomic structures. The operator can perform a visual and or computer assisted inspection of the fit between the articular repair system and the implantation site. This can be performed for different positions of the joint e.g. extension 45 90 degrees of flexion adduction abduction internal or external rotation. The procedure can be repeated until a satisfactory fit has been achieved. The procedure can be entirely manual by the operator it can however also be computer assisted. For example the software can select a first trial implant that the operator can test e.g. evaluate the fit . Software that highlights areas of poor alignment between the implant and the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci or other tissues can also be designed and used. Based on this information the software or the operator can select another implant and test its alignment.

In all of the above embodiments the mechanical axis and relevant anatomical axes or planes can be displayed simultaneous with the joint and or articular repair device in the 2 D or 3 D display. Simultaneous display of at least one or more biomechanical axes or anatomical axes or planes can help improve the assessment of fit of the articular repair system. Biomechanical axis or relevant anatomical axes or planes can also be displayed for different positions of the joint.

Rapid protyping is a technique for fabricating a three dimensional object from a computer model of the object. A special printer is used to fabricate the prototype from a plurality of two dimensional layers. Computer software sections the representations of the object into a plurality of distinct two dimensional layers and then a three dimensional printer fabricates a layer of material for each layer sectioned by the software. Together the various fabricated layers form the desired prototype. More information about rapid prototyping techniques is available in US Patent Publication No 2002 0079601A1 to Russell et al. published Jun. 27 2002. An advantage to using rapid prototyping is that it enables the use of free form fabrication techniques that use toxic or potent compounds safely. These compounds can be safely incorporated in an excipient envelope which reduces worker exposure

A powder piston and build bed are provided. Powder includes any material metal plastic etc. that can be made into a powder or bonded with a liquid. The power is rolled from a feeder source with a spreader onto a surface of a bed. The thickness of the layer is controlled by the computer. The print head then deposits a binder fluid onto the powder layer at a location where it is desired that the powder bind. Powder is again rolled into the build bed and the process is repeated with the binding fluid deposition being controlled at each layer to correspond to the three dimensional location of the device formation. For a further discussion of this process see for example US Patent Publication No 2003 017365A1 to Monkhouse et al. published Sep. 18 2003.

The rapid prototyping can use the two dimensional images obtained as described above in Section I to determine each of the two dimensional shapes for each of the layers of the prototyping machine. In this scenario each two dimensional image slice would correspond to a two dimensional prototype slide. Alternatively the three dimensional shape of the defect can be determined as described above and then broken down into two dimensional slices for the rapid prototyping process. The advantage of using the three dimensional model is that the two dimensional slices used for the rapid prototyping machine can be along the same plane as the two dimensional images taken or along a different plane altogether.

Rapid prototyping can be combined or used in conjunction with casting techniques. For example a shell or container with inner dimensions corresponding to an articular repair system including surgical instruments molds alignment guides or surgical guides can be made using rapid prototyping. Plastic or wax like materials are typically used for this purpose. The inside of the container can subsequently be coated for example with a ceramic for subsequent casting. Using this process personalized casts can be generated.

Rapid prototyping can be used for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc. Rapid prototyping can be performed at a manufacturing facility. Alternatively it may be performed in the operating room after an intraoperative measurement has been performed.

Alternatively milling techniques can be utilized for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc.

Alternatively laser based techniques can be utilized for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc.

Following one or more manipulations e.g. shaping growth development etc the cartilage replacement implant or regenerating material can then be implanted into the area of the defect. Implantation can be performed with the cartilage replacement or regenerating material still attached to the base material or removed from the base material. Any suitable methods and devices can be used for implantation for example devices as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 375 658 to Hangody et al. issued Apr. 23 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 358 253 to Torrie et al. issued Mar. 19 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 328 765 to Hardwick et al. issued Dec. 11 2001 and International Publication WO 01 19254 to Cummings et al. published Mar. 22 2001.

In selected cartilage defects the implantation site can be prepared with a single cut across the articular surface for example. If desired single and multi component prostheses can be utilized.

The various system and methods described herein may also be utilized to repair revise or otherwise correct a previously treated implant that has failed in some manner. Typically joint replacement candidates and the surgeries they experience follow a cascade process where less invasive solutions and joint treatments are initially attempted and are eventually followed by more invasive surgical procedures as the patient s joints and or any implanted joint resurfacing and or replacement components continue to degenerate. In the case of the knee joint a patient can be diagnosed with a degenerative knee condition and is preferably treated in a non surgical manner until the joint has degenerated sufficiently to mandate surgical intervention. Minimally invasive repair techniques and or partial knee replacement implants may be surgically implanted but in most cases the degenerative process will continue eventually requiring the implantation of a total knee replacement. As the degenerative cascade continues total knee implants that require revision are typically assumed to involve significant bone loss and often a lack of normal bony reference points or landmarks for properly aligning the implant. In these cases surgeons often default to the use of the intramedullary canals of the femur and or tibia as landmarks and or anchoring points for positioning the various components of the revision prosthesis. Once such intramedullary stems are in place further implant revision may be difficult or impossible and may involve significantly more invasive procedures to anchor and or position the prosthetic components. Alternatively joint fusion may eventually be necessary.

Similar degenerative cascades are faced during virtually all joint replacement procedures with each level of surgery typically involving more invasive surgical procedures and often requiring removal of additional joint structure to accommodate the increasingly invasive revision prosthesis. As with virtually all types of joints joint fusion is often the eventual last resort. 

One objective of this disclosure is to allow for accurate pre operative assessment and modeling of the failed implant and associated anatomical structures desirably to facilitate selection or design and manufacture of a revision implant and associated surgical tools that facilitate removal of the failed implant preparation of the anatomical support structure and implantation of the revision implant with preservation of a maximum of the existing anatomical support structure i.e. underlying structures such as cortical and cancellous bone while ensuring good support for the revision implant. Moreover such objectives will desirably reduce or delay the need for anchoring support from intramedullary rods which will desirably be reserved for a last step in revision implant replacement for treating the degenerative cascade.

The evaluated and or corrected final image set may then be used to select and or create a revision implant as well as to plan the surgical procedure and the surgical instruments used therein. In some embodiments the revision implant will be chosen from a pre formed library of implants or the revision implant may be created from a pre existing electronic data file or may be custom designed as known in the art . If an implant is selected from a pre formed library it can optionally be adapted for the patient s anatomic or pathological conditions for example using a CNC or other abrasion or additive process. Similarly the final image set may be utilized to create custom surgical tools for use in preparation of the anatomical support structures either before or after removal of some or all of the failed implant components or in certain embodiments some or all of the implant components may remain in situ . Once the site has been prepared and any failed implant components removed if desired the revision implant is implanted.

The various embodiments of this disclosure contemplate the design and manufacture of numerous surgical tools and jigs useful for preparing the anatomical structures for the revision implant. Desirably the various surgical tools and jigs described herein will incorporate various patient specific and or implant specific features including failed and revision implant features or dimensions which facilitate their use during the preparation of anatomical structures and implantation of the revision implant components.

Aside from patient specific anatomical features the various embodiments contemplate the use of various features of the failed implant to assist in alignment and or positioning of the various surgical tools and or jigs. For example it may be desirous to design and manufacture an alignment jig having one or more surfaces that fit over and or abut against a portion of the failed implant prior to removal of the failed implant from the patient s anatomy optionally with one or more alignment guides for placement of alignment pins or other indicia i.e. marker pins for cutting plane jigs etc . After placement of such indicia and removal of the jig and subsequently the failed implant the preparation of the underlying anatomical support structure for the revision implant may proceed as known in the art. In this way the use of intramedullary rods and other such alignment guides may be rendered superfluous and or obviated facilitating the preparation of appropriate bone structures without the sacrifice of unnecessary additional anatomical structures as is current practice in the art.

Table 3 provides a non exhaustive list of various failed implant features that could be used as anatomical reference points from alignment and or placement of surgical tools as described herein 

In a similar manner the various embodiments of surgical tools and or jigs described herein could include various combinations of failed implant surfaces or features patient specific anatomical features and or combinations thereof. For example a jig could include surfaces that only interact and align with external surface s or other features of the failed implant. Alternatively the jig could include surfaces that only interact and align with external anatomical features of the patient either those accessible with the failed implant in position within the anatomy or those revealed after removal of some or all of the failed implant components. As another alternative the jig could include surfaces that interact and align with both some external surface feature s of the failed implant as well as some accessible anatomical features. In various other embodiments the jig may incorporate combinations of the above listed interacting alignment surfaces in concert with other surfaces that do not interact or align with either failed implant or accessible anatomical surfaces i.e. surfaces that avoid contact or alignment including anatomical relief surfaces disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 207 396 . In addition the jig could include surfaces that interact and align with the failed implant on one articular surface and an accessible anatomic surface or an anatomic surface revealed after removal of an implant component on the opposite articular surface.

The various jigs and other surgical tools disclosed herein could have numerous uses during the surgical preparation and implantation procedure including 1 as guides for removal of cement or other biologic and non biologic material s 2 as alignment and or depth guides for creating reaming an intramedullary canal 3 as alignment or depth guides for creation of desirable anatomical features and or cut planes 4 as alignment guides for removal of osteophytes and or other undesirable bone features 5 as guides and or molds for cement or other biologic non biologic placement 6 as measuring or alignment guide for determining size and location of spacers wedges etc. 7 as guides to set a femoral tibial humeral glenoid or other implant rotation internal or external orientation and or anteversion or retroversion flexion or extension for the implant and or a revision implant 8 as jigs for ligament balancing measuring or simulating flexion and extension gaps 9 as jigs for placement of augments spacers wedges etc. including non patient specific and patient specific augments modular or non modular components or having openings or voids for accommodating augments 10 as jigs for controlling component rotation or flexion extension or ante or retroversion NP cutting guides optionally referencing medullary canal or peg holes from primary implant or from revision implant and or anatomical features 11 as jigs for augment cuts and or 12 as jigs for controlling the alignment of constraining features or mating components of revision implants. The various jig features can interact with anatomical and or failed implant features or combinations thereof to align the implant along multiple planes displacements and or at one or more orientations to provide desired alignment data and or provide one or more guides for preparation of the anatomical support structure for the revision implant. These features can be helpful in implanting devices that have constraining mating or interlocking features.

Table 4 provides an non exhaustive exemplary list of proposed functions for surgical tools and jigs of the present invention 

The following list provides various combinations of implants jigs and support alignment surfaces using tibia as an example contemplated by the present embodiments 

Performing a total knee arthroplasty primary or revision procedure is a complicated procedure. In replacing the knee with an artificial knee or revising a failed or failing knee implant it is important to get the anatomical and mechanical axes of the lower extremity aligned correctly to ensure optimal functioning of the implanted knee.

As shown in the center of the hip located at the head of the femur the center of the knee located at the notch where the intercondular tubercle of the tibia meet the femur and ankle lie approximately in a straight line which defines the mechanical axis of the lower extremity. The anatomic axis aligns 5 7 offset from the mechanical axis in the valgus or outward direction.

The long axis of the tibia is collinear with the mechanical axis of the lower extremity . From a three dimensional perspective the lower extremity of the body ideally functions within a single plane known as the median anterior posterior plane MAP plane throughout the flexion extension arc. In order to accomplish this the femoral head the mechanical axis of the femur the patellar groove the intercondylar notch the patellar articular crest the tibia and the ankle remain within the MAP plane during the flexion extension movement. During movement the tibia rotates as the knee flexes and extends in the epicondylar axis which is perpendicular to the MAP plane.

A variety of image slices can be taken at each individual joint e.g. the knee joint and the hip joint . These image slices can be used as described above in Section I along with an image of the full leg to ascertain the axis.

With disease and malfunction of the knee alignment of the anatomic axis is altered. Performing a total knee arthroplasty is one solution for correcting a diseased knee. Implanting a total knee joint such as the PFC Sigma RP Knee System by Johnson Johnson requires that a series of resections be made to the surfaces forming the knee joint in order to facilitate installation of the artificial knee. The resections should be made to enable the installed artificial knee to achieve flexion extension movement within the MAP plane and to optimize the patient s anatomical and mechanical axis of the lower extremity.

First the tibia is resected to create a flat surface to accept the tibial component of the implant. In most cases the tibial surface is resected perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia in the coronal plane but is typically sloped 4 7 posteriorly in the sagittal plane to match the normal slope of the tibia. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the sagittal slope can be 0 where the device to be implanted does not require a sloped tibial cut. The resection line is perpendicular to the mechanical axis but the angle between the resection line and the surface plane of the plateau varies depending on the amount of damage to the knee.

The plateau of the femur is resected to provide flat surfaces that communicate with the interior of the femoral prosthesis. The cuts made to the femur are based on the overall height of the gap to be created between the tibia and the femur. Typically a 20 mm gap is desirable to provide the implanted prosthesis adequate room to achieve full range of motion. The bone is resected at a 5 7 angle valgus to the mechanical axis of the femur. Resected surface forms a flat plane with an angular relationship to adjoining surfaces . The angle between the surfaces and varies according to the design of the implant.

As illustrated in the external geometry of the proximal femur includes the head the neck the lesser trochanter the greater trochanter and the proximal femoral diaphysis. The relative positions of the trochanters the femoral head center and the femoral shaft are correlated with the inclination of the neck shaft angle. The mechanical axis and anatomic axis are also shown. Assessment of these relationships can change the reaming direction to achieve neutral alignment of the prosthesis with the femoral canal.

Using anteroposterior and lateral radiographs measurements are made of the proximal and distal geometry to determine the size and optimal design of the implant.

Typically after obtaining surgical access to the hip joint the femoral neck is resected e.g. along the line . Once the neck is resected the medullary canal is reamed. Reaming can be accomplished for example with a conical or straight reamer or a flexible reamer. The depth of reaming is dictated by the specific design of the implant. Once the canal has been reamed the proximal reamer is prepared by serial rasping with the rasp directed down into the canal.

Further surgical assistance can be provided by using a device applied to the outer surface of the articular cartilage the bone including the subchondral bone in order to match the alignment of the articular repair system and the recipient site or the joint. The device can be round circular oval ellipsoid curved or irregular in shape. The shape can be selected or adjusted to match or enclose an area of diseased cartilage or an area slightly larger than the area of diseased cartilage or substantially larger than the diseased cartilage. The area can encompass the entire articular surface or the weight bearing surface. Such devices are typically preferred when replacement of a majority or an entire articular surface is contemplated.

Mechanical devices can be used for surgical assistance e.g. surgical tools for example using gels molds plastics or metal. One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be utilized to either shape the device e.g. using a CAD CAM technique to be adapted to a patient s articular anatomy or alternatively to select a typically pre made device that has a good fit with a patient s articular anatomy. The device can have a surface and shape that will substantially match or conform to all or portions of the articular cartilage subchondral bone and or other bone surface and shape e.g. similar to a negative. The device can include without limitation one or more cut planes apertures slots and or holes to accommodate surgical instruments such as drills reamers curettes k wires screws and saws.

The device may have a single component or multiple components. The components may be attached to the unoperated and operated portions of the intra or extra articular anatomy. For example one component may be attached to the femoral neck while another component may be in contact with the greater or lesser trochanter. Typically the different components can be used to assist with different parts of the surgical procedure. When multiple components are used one or more components may also be attached to a different component rather than the articular cartilage subchondral bone or other areas of osseous or non osseous anatomy. For example a tibial mold may be attached to a femoral mold and tibial cuts can be performed in reference to femoral cuts.

Components may also be designed to fit to the joint after an operative step has been performed. For example in a knee one component may be designed to fit all or portions of a distal femur before any cuts have been made while another component may be designed to fit on a cut that has been made with the previously used mold or component. In a hip one component may be used to perform an initial cut for example through the femoral neck while another subsequently used component may be designed to fit on the femoral neck after the cut for example covering the area of the cut with a central opening for insertion of a reamer. Using this approach subsequent surgical steps may also be performed with high accuracy e.g. reaming of the marrow cavity.

In another embodiment a guide may be attached to a mold to control the direction and orientation of surgical instruments. For example after the femoral neck has been cut a mold may be attached to the area of the cut whereby it fits portions or all of the exposed bone surface. The mold may have an opening adapted for a reamer. Before the reamer is introduced a femoral reamer guide may be inserted into the mold and advanced into the marrow cavity. The position and orientation of the reamer guide may be determined by the femoral mold. The reamer can then be advanced over the reamer guide and the marrow cavity can be reamed with improved accuracy. Similar approaches are feasible in the knee and other joints.

All mold components may be disposable. Alternatively some molds components may be re usable. Typically mold components applied after a surgical step such as a cut as been performed can be reusable since a reproducible anatomic interface will have been established.

Interconnecting or bridging components may be used. For example such interconnecting or bridging components may couple the mold attached to the joint with a standard preferably unmodified or only minimally modified cut block used during knee or hip surgery. Interconnecting or bridging components may be made of plastic or metal. When made of metal or other hard material they can help protect the joint from plastic debris for example when a reamer or saw would otherwise get into contact with the mold.

The accuracy of the attachment between the component or mold and the cartilage or subchondral bone or other osseous structures is typically better than 2 mm more preferred better than 1 mm more preferred better than 0.7 mm more preferred better than 0.5 mm or even more preferred better than 0.5 mm. The accuracy of the attachment between different components or between one or more molds and one or more surgical instruments is typically better than 2 mm more preferred better than 1 mm more preferred better than 0.7 mm more preferred better than 0.5 mm or even more preferred better than 0.5 mm.

The angular error of any attachments or between any components or between components molds instruments and or the anatomic or biomechanical axes is preferably less than 2 degrees more preferably less than 1.5 degrees more preferably less than 1 degree and even more preferably less than 0.5 degrees. The total angular error is preferably less than 2 degrees more preferably less than 1.5 degrees more preferably less than 1 degree and even more preferably less than 0.5 degrees.

Typically a position will be chosen that will result in an anatomically desirable cut plane drill hole or general instrument orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system or for facilitating placement of the articular repair system. Moreover the device can be designed so that the depth of the drill reamer or other surgical instrument can be controlled e.g. the drill cannot go any deeper into the tissue than defined by the device and the size of the hole in the block can be designed to essentially match the size of the implant. Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of these slots or holes. Alternatively the openings in the device can be made larger than needed to accommodate these instruments. The device can also be configured to conform to the articular shape. The apertures or openings provided can be wide enough to allow for varying the position or angle of the surgical instrument e.g. reamers saws drills curettes and other surgical instruments. An instrument guide typically comprised of a relatively hard material can then be applied to the device. The device helps orient the instrument guide relative to the three dimensional anatomy of the joint.

The mold may contact the entire articular surface. In various embodiments the mold can be in contact with only a portion of the articular surface. Thus the mold can be in contact without limitation with 100 of the articular surface 80 of the articular surface 50 of the articular surface 30 of the articular surface 30 of the articular surface 20 of the articular surface or 10 or less of the articular surface. An advantage of a smaller surface contact area is a reduction in size of the mold thereby enabling cost efficient manufacturing and more important minimally invasive surgical techniques. The size of the mold and its surface contact areas have to be sufficient however to ensure accurate placement so that subsequent drilling and cutting can be performed with sufficient accuracy.

In various embodiments the maximum diameter of the mold is less than 10 cm. In other embodiments the maximum diameter of the mold may be less than 8 cm 5 cm 4 cm 3 cm or even less than 2 cm.

The mold may be in contact with three or more surface points rather than an entire surface. These surface points may be on the articular surface or external to the articular surface. By using contact points rather than an entire surface or portions of the surface the size of the mold may be reduced.

Reductions in the size of the mold can be used to enable minimally invasive surgery MIS in the hip the knee the shoulder and other joints. MIS technique with small molds will help to reduce intraoperative blood loss preserve tissue including possibly bone enable muscle sparing techniques and reduce postoperative pain and enable faster recovery. Thus in one embodiment of this disclosure the mold is used in conjunction with a muscle sparing technique. In another embodiment the mold may be used with a bone sparing technique. In another embodiment the mold is shaped to enable MIS technique with an incision size of less than 15 cm or more preferred less than 13 cm or more preferred less than 10 cm or more preferred less than 8 cm or more preferred less than 6 cm.

The mold may be placed in contact with points or surfaces outside of the articular surface. For example the mold can rest on bone in the intercondylar notch or the anterior or other aspects of the tibia or the acetabular rim or the lesser or greater trochanter. Optionally the mold may only rest on points or surfaces that are external to the articular surface. Furthermore the mold may rest on points or surfaces within the weight bearing surface or on points or surfaces external to the weight bearing surface.

The mold may be designed to rest on bone or cartilage outside the area to be worked on e.g. cut drilled etc. In this manner multiple surgical steps can be performed using the same mold. For example in the knee the mold may be stabilized against portions of the intercondylar notch which can be selected external to areas to be removed for total knee arthroplasty or other procedures. In the hip the mold may be attached external to the acetabular fossa providing a reproducible reference that is maintained during a procedure for example total hip arthroplasty. The mold may be affixed to the underlying bone for example with pins or drills etc.

In additional embodiments the mold may rest on the articular cartilage. The mold may rest on the subchondral bone or on structures external to the articular surface that are within the joint space or on structures external to the joint space. If the mold is designed to rest on the cartilage an imaging test demonstrating the articular cartilage can be used in one embodiment. This can for example include ultrasound spiral CT arthrography MRI using for example cartilage displaying pulse sequences or MRI arthrography. In another embodiment an imaging test demonstrating the subchondral bone e.g. CT or spiral CT can be used and a standard cartilage thickness can be added to the scan. The standard cartilage thickness can be derived for example using an anatomic reference database age gender and race matching age adjustments and any method known in the art or developed in the future for deriving estimates of cartilage thickness. The standard cartilage thickness may in some embodiments be uniform across one or more articular surfaces or it can change across the articular surface.

The mold may be adapted to rest substantially on subchondral bone. In this case residual cartilage can create some offset and inaccurate result with resultant inaccuracy in surgical cuts drilling and the like. In one embodiment the residual cartilage is removed in a first step in areas where the mold is designed to contact the bone and the subchondral bone is exposed. In a second step the mold is then placed on the subchondral bone.

In various alternative embodiments the mold may include one or more surfaces that contact or interact with i.e. match or substantially conform to surfaces of a failed implant .

With advanced osteoarthritis significant articular deformity can result. The articular surface s can become flattened. There can be cyst formation or osteophyte formation. Tram track like structures can form on the articular surface. In one embodiment osteophytes or other deformities may be removed by the computer software prior to generation of the mold. The software can automatically semi automatically or manually with input from the user simulate surgical removal of the osteophytes or other deformities and predict the resulting shape of the joint and the associated surfaces. The mold can then be designed based on the predicted shape. Intraoperatively these osteophytes or other deformities can then also optionally be removed prior to placing the mold and performing the procedure. Alternatively the mold can be designed to avoid such deformities. For example the mold may only be in contact with points on the articular surface or external to the articular surface that are not affected or involved by osteophytes. The mold can rest on the articular surface or external to the articular surface on three or more points or small surfaces with the body of the mold elevated or detached from the articular surface so that the accuracy of its position cannot be affected by osteophytes or other articular deformities. The mold can rest on one or more tibial spines or portions of the tibial spines. Alternatively all or portions of the mold may be designed to rest on osteophytes or other excrescences or pathological changes.

The surgeon can optionally make fine adjustments between the alignment device and the instrument guide. In this manner an optimal compromise can be found for example between biomechanical alignment and joint laxity or biomechanical alignment and joint function e.g. in a knee joint flexion gap and extension gap. By oversizing the openings in the alignment guide the surgeon can utilize the instruments and insert them in the instrument guide without damaging the alignment guide. Thus in particular if the alignment guide is made of plastic debris will not be introduced into the joint. The position and orientation between the alignment guide and the instrument guide can be also be optimized with the use of for example interposed spacers wedges screws and other mechanical or electrical methods known in the art.

A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose for example spacers can be introduced that are attached or that are in contact with one or more molds. The surgeon can intraoperatively evaluate the laxity or tightness of a joint using spacers with different thickness or one or more spacers with the same thickness. For example spacers can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. The knee joint can then be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon will select an optimal combination of spacers for a given joint and mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the mold with the spacers optionally interposed between the mold and the cut guide. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Thus the position of a mold can be optimized relative to the joint bone or cartilage for soft tissue tension ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion. The position of a cut block or other surgical instrument may be optimized relative to the mold for soft tissue tension or for ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion. Both the position of the mold and the position of other components including cut blocks and surgical instruments may be optimized for soft tissue tension or for ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion.

Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts or other interventions. As stated above expandable or ratchet like devices may be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the mold see also . Such devices can extend from a cutting block or other devices attached to the mold optimizing the position of drill holes or cuts for different joint positions or they can be integrated inside the mold. Integration in the cutting block or other devices attached to the mold is preferable since the expandable or ratchet like mechanisms can be sterilized and re used during other surgeries for example in other patients. Optionally the expandable or ratchet like devices may be disposable. The expandable or ratchet like devices may extend to the joint without engaging or contacting the mold alternatively these devices may engage or contact the mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of the cut guide relative to the molds may be used. These embodiments are helpful for soft tissue tension optimization and ligament balancing in different joints for different static positions and during joint motion.

A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose for example spacers or expandable or ratchet like can be utilized that can be attached or that can be in contact with one or more molds.

For example spacers or a ratchet like device can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. The knee joint can then be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon will select an optimal combination of spacers or an optimal position for an expandable or ratchet like device for a given joint and mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the mold with the spacers or the expandable or ratchet like device optionally interposed between the mold and the cut guide or in select embodiments between the mold and the joint or the mold and an opposite articular surface. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts or drill holes. For example expandable or ratchet like devices can be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of the cut guide relative to the molds can be used.

The template and any related instrumentation such as spacers or ratchets can be combined with a tensiometer to provide a better intraoperative assessment of the joint. The tensiometer can be utilized to further optimize the anatomic alignment and tightness of the joint and to improve post operative function and outcomes. Optionally local contact pressures may be evaluated intraoperatively for example using a sensor like the ones manufactured by Tekscan South Boston Mass. The contact pressures can be measured between the mold and the joint or between the mold and any attached devices such as a surgical cut block.

The template may be a mold that can be made of a plastic or polymer. The mold may be produced by rapid prototyping technology in which successive layers of plastic are laid down as know in the art. In other embodiments the template or portions of the template can be made of metal. The mold can be milled or made using laser based manufacturing techniques.

The template may be casted using rapid prototyping and for example lost wax technique. It may also be milled. For example a preformed mold with a generic shape can be used at the outset which can then be milled to the patient specific dimensions. The milling may only occur on one surface of the mold preferably the surface that faces the articular surface. Milling and rapid prototyping techniques may be combined.

Curable materials may be used which can be poured into forms that are for example generated using rapid prototyping. For example liquid metal may be used. Cured materials may optionally be milled or the surface can be further refined using other techniques.

Metal inserts may be applied to plastic components. For example a plastic mold may have at least one guide aperture to accept a reaming device or a saw. A metal insert may be used to provide a hard wall to accept the reamer or saw. Using this or similar designs can be useful to avoid the accumulation of plastic or other debris in the joint when the saw or other surgical instruments may get in contact with the mold. Other hard materials can be used to serve as inserts. These can also include for example hard plastics or ceramics.

In another embodiment the mold does not have metallic inserts to accept a reaming device or saw. The metal inserts or guides may be part of an attached device that is typically in contact with the mold. A metallic drill guide or a metallic saw guide may thus for example have metallic or hard extenders that reach through the mold thereby for example also stabilizing any devices applied to the mold against the physical body of the mold.

The template may not only be used for assisting the surgical technique and guiding the placement and direction of surgical instruments. In addition the templates can be utilized for guiding the placement of the implant or implant components. For example in the hip joint tilting of the acetabular component is a frequent problem with total hip arthroplasty. A template can be applied to the acetabular wall with an opening in the center large enough to accommodate the acetabular component that the surgeon intends to place. The template can have receptacles or notches that match the shape of small extensions that can be part of the implant or that can be applied to the implant. For example the implant can have small members or extensions applied to the twelve o clock and six o clock positions. See for example discussed below. By aligning these members with notches or receptacles in the mold the surgeon can ensure that the implant is inserted without tilting or rotation. These notches or receptacles can also be helpful to hold the implant in place while bone cement is hardening in cemented designs.

One or more templates can be used during the surgery. For example in the hip a template can be initially applied to the proximal femur that closely approximates the 3D anatomy prior to the resection of the femoral head. The template can include an opening to accommodate a saw see . The opening is positioned to achieve an optimally placed surgical cut for subsequent reaming and placement of the prosthesis. A second template can then be applied to the proximal femur after the surgical cut has been made. The second template can be useful for guiding the direction of a reamer prior to placement of the prosthesis. As can be seen in this as well as in other examples templates can be made for joints prior to any surgical intervention. However it is also possible to make templates that are designed to fit to a bone portions of a joint and or surface of a failed implant after the surgeon has already performed selected surgical procedures such as cutting reaming drilling etc. The template can account for the shape of the bone or the joint resulting from these procedures.

In certain embodiments the surgical assistance device comprises an array of adjustable closely spaced pins e.g. plurality of individually moveable mechanical elements . One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be entered or transferred into the device for example manually or electronically and the information can be used to create a surface and shape that will match all or portions of the articular and or bone surface and shape by moving one or more of the elements e.g. similar to an image. The device can include slots and holes to accommodate surgical instruments such as drills curettes k wires screws and saws. The position of these slots and holes may be adjusted by moving one or more of the mechanical elements. Typically a position will be chosen that will result in an anatomically desirable cut plane reaming direction or drill hole or instrument orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system or for facilitating the placement of an articular repair system.

Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of the without limitation cut planes apertures slots or holes on the template in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The biomechanical and or anatomic axes may be derived using above described imaging techniques including without limitation a standard radiograph including a load bearing radiograph for example an upright knee x ray or a whole leg length film e.g. hip to foot These radiographs may be acquired in different projections for example anteroposterior posteroanterior lateral oblique etc. The biomechanical and anatomic axes may also be derived using other imaging modalities such as CT scan or MRI scan a CT scout scan or MRI localized scans through portions or all of the extremity either alone or in combination as described in above embodiments. For example when total or partial knee arthroplasty is contemplated a spiral CT scan may be obtained through the knee joint. The spiral CT scan through the knee joint serves as the basis for generating the negative contour template s mold s that will be affixed to portions or all of the knee joint. Additional CT or MRI scans may be obtained through the hip and ankle joint. These may be used to define the centroids or centerpoints in each joint or other anatomic landmarks for example and then to derive the biomechanical and other axes.

In another embodiment the mechanical axis may be established using non image based approaches including traditional surgical instruments and measurement tools such as intramedullary rods alignment guides and also surgical navigation. For example in a knee joint optical or radiofrequency markers can be attached to the extremity. The lower limb may then be rotated around the hip joint and the position of the markers can be recorded for different limb positions. The center of the rotation will determine the center of the femoral head. Similar reference points may be determined in the ankle joint etc. The position of the templates or more typically the position of surgical instruments relative to the templates may then be optimized for a given biomechanical load pattern for example in varus or valgus alignment. Thus by performing these measurements pre or intraoperatively the position of the surgical instruments may be optimized relative to the molds and the cuts can be placed to correct underlying axis errors such as varus or valgus malalignment or ante or retroversion.

Upon imaging a physical template of a joint such as a knee joint or hip joint or ankle joint or shoulder joint is generated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The template can be modified or analyzed using additional image groups as previously described and can be used to perform image guided surgical procedures such as partial or complete joint replacement articular resurfacing or ligament repair. The template may include reference points or opening or apertures for surgical instruments such as drills saws burrs and the like.

In order to derive the preferred orientation of drill holes cut planes saw planes and the like openings or receptacles in said template or attachments will be adjusted to account for at least one axis e.g. mechanical or anatomical . The axis can be anatomic or mechanical for example for a knee joint a hip joint an ankle joint a shoulder joint or an elbow joint.

In one embodiment only a single axis e.g. mechanical or anatomical is used for placing and optimizing such drill holes saw planes cut planes and or other surgical interventions. This axis may be for example an anatomical or mechanical axis. In a preferred embodiment a combination of axis and or planes can be used for optimizing the placement of the drill holes saw planes cut planes or other surgical interventions. For example two axes e.g. one anatomical and one biomechanical can be factored into the position shape or orientation of the 3D guided template and related attachments or linkages. For example two axes e.g. one anatomical and biomechanical and one plane e.g. the top plane defined by the tibial plateau can be used. Alternatively two or more planes can be used e.g. a coronal and a sagittal plane as defined by the image or by the patients anatomy.

Angle and distance measurements and surface topography measurements may be performed in these one or more preferably two or more preferably three or more multiple planes as necessary. These angle measurements can for example yield information on varus or valgus deformity flexion or extension deficit hyper or hypo flexion or hyper or hypo extension abduction adduction internal or external rotation deficit or hyper or hypo abduction hyper or hypo adduction hyper or hypo internal or external rotation.

Single or multi axis line or plane measurements can then be utilized to determine preferred angles of correction e.g. by adjusting surgical cut or saw planes or other surgical interventions. Typically two axis corrections will be preferred over a single axis correction a two plane correction will be preferred over a single plane correction and so forth.

In accordance with another embodiment more than one drilling cut boring and or reaming or other surgical intervention is performed for a particular treatment such as the placement of a joint resurfacing or replacing implant or components thereof. These two or more surgical interventions e.g. drilling cutting reaming sawing are made in relationship to a mechanical axis and or an anatomical axis and or an implant axis. The 3D guidance template or attachments or linkages thereto include two or more openings guides apertures or reference planes to make at least two or more drillings reamings borings sawings or cuts in relationship to a mechanical axis an anatomical axis an implant axis or other axis derived therefrom or related thereto.

While in simple embodiments it is possible that only a single cut or drilling will be made in relationship to a mechanical axis an anatomical axis an implant axis and or an axis related thereto in most meaningful implementations two or more drillings borings reamings cuttings and or sawings will be performed or combinations thereof in relationship to a biomechanical anatomical and or implant axis.

For example an initial cut may be placed in relationship to a mechanical axis of particular joint. A subsequent drilling cut or other intervention can be performed in relation to an anatomical axis. Both can be designed to achieve a correction in a mechanical axis and or anatomical axis. In another example an initial cut can be performed in relationship to a mechanical axis while a subsequent cut is performed in relationship to an implant axis or an implant plane. Any combination in surgical interventions and in relating them to any combination of biomechanical anatomical implant axis or planes related thereto is possible. In many embodiments it is desirable that a single cut or drilling be made in relationship to a biomechanical or anatomical axis. Subsequent cuts or drillings or other surgical interventions can then be made in reference to said first intervention. These subsequent interventions can be performed directly off the same 3D guidance template or they can be performed by attaching surgical instruments or linkages or reference frames or secondary or other templates to the first template or the cut plane or hole and the like created with the first template.

In another embodiment a frame can be applied to the bone or the cartilage in areas other than the diseased bone or cartilage. The frame can include holders and guides for surgical instruments. The frame can be attached to one or preferably more previously defined anatomic reference points. Alternatively the position of the frame can be cross registered relative to one or more anatomic landmarks using an imaging test or intraoperative measurement for example one or more fluoroscopic images acquired intraoperatively. One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements including using mechanical devices can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be entered or transferred into the device for example manually or electronically and the information can be used to move one or more of the holders or guides for surgical instruments. Typically a position will be chosen that will result in a surgically or anatomically desirable cut plane or drill hole orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system. Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of these slots or holes.

Furthermore re useable tools e.g. templates or molds can be also be created and employed. Non limiting examples of re useable materials include putties and other deformable materials e.g. an array of adjustable closely spaced pins that can be configured to match the topography of a joint surface .

In various embodiments the template may include a reference element such as a pin that upon positioning of the template on the articular surface establishes a reference plane relative to a mechanical axis or an anatomical axis or plane of a limb. For example in a knee surgery the reference element may establish a reference plane from the center of the hip to the center of the ankle. In other embodiments the reference element may establish an axis that subsequently be used a surgical tool to correct an axis deformity.

In these embodiments the template can be created directly from the joint during surgery or alternatively created from an image of the joint for example using one or more computer programs to determine object coordinates defining the surface contour of the joint and transferring e.g. dialing in these co ordinates to the tool. Subsequently the tool can be aligned accurately over the joint and or existing implant component and accordingly the surgical instrument guide or the implant will be more accurately placed in or over the articular surface.

In both single use and re useable embodiments the tool can be designed so that the instrument controls the depth and or direction of the drill i.e. the drill cannot go any deeper into the tissue than the instrument allows and the size of the hole or aperture in the instrument can be designed to essentially match the size of the implant. The tool can be used for general prosthesis implantation including but not limited to the articular repair implants described herein and for reaming the marrow in the case of a total arthroplasty.

These surgical tools devices can also be used to remove an area of diseased cartilage and underlying bone or an area slightly larger than the diseased cartilage and underlying bone. In addition the device can be used on a donor e.g. a cadaveric specimen to obtain implantable repair material. The device is typically positioned in the same general anatomic area in which the tissue was removed in the recipient. The shape of the device is then used to identify a donor site providing a seamless or near seamless match between the donor tissue sample and the recipient site. This can be achieved by identifying the position of the device in which the articular surface in the donor e.g. a cadaveric specimen has a seamless or near seamless contact with the inner surface when applied to the cartilage.

The device can be molded rapid prototyped machine and or formed based on the size of the area of diseased cartilage and based on the curvature of the cartilage or the underlying subchondral bone or a combination of both or using adjacent structures inside or external to the joint space. The device can take into consideration surgical removal of for example the meniscus in arriving at a joint surface configuration.

In one embodiment the device can then be applied to the donor e.g. a cadaveric specimen and the donor tissue can be obtained with use of a blade or saw or other tissue removing device. The device can then be applied to the recipient in the area of the joint and the diseased cartilage where applicable and underlying bone can be removed with use of a blade or saw or other tissue cutting device whereby the size and shape of the removed tissue containing the diseased cartilage will closely resemble the size and shape of the donor tissue. The donor tissue can then be attached to the recipient site. For example said attachment can be achieved with use of screws or pins e.g. metallic non metallic or bioresorable or other fixation means including but not limited to a tissue adhesive. Attachment can be through the cartilage surface or alternatively through the marrow space.

The implant site can be prepared with use of a robotic device. The robotic device can use information from an electronic image for preparing the recipient site.

Identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant can be supported by a surgical navigation system. In such a system the position or orientation of a surgical instrument with respect to the patient s anatomy can be tracked in real time in one or more 2D or 3D images. These 2D or 3D images can be calculated from images that were acquired preoperatively such as MR or CT images. Non image based surgical navigation systems that find axes or anatomical structures for example with use of joint motion can also be used. The position and orientation of the surgical instrument as well as the mold including alignment guides surgical instrument guides reaming guides drill guides saw guides etc. can be determined from markers attached to these devices. These markers can be located by a detector using for example optical acoustical or electromagnetic signals.

Identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant can also be supported with use of a C arm system. The C arm system can afford imaging of the joint in one or preferably multiple planes. The multiplanar imaging capability can aid in defining the shape of an articular surface. This information can be used to selected an implant with a good fit to the articular surface. Currently available C arm systems also afford cross sectional imaging capability for example for identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant. C arm imaging can be combined with administration of radiographic contrast.

In various embodiments the surgical devices described herein can include one or more materials that harden to form a mold of the articular surface. In preferred embodiments the materials used are biocompatible such as without limitation acylonitrile butadiene styrene polyphenylsulfone and polycarbonate. As used herein biocompatible shall mean any material that is not toxic to the body e.g. produces a negative reaction under ISO 10993 standards incorporated herein by reference . In various embodiments these biocompatible materials may be compatible with rapid prototyping techniques.

In further embodiments the mold material is capable of heat sterilization without deformation. An exemplary mold material is polyphenylsulfone which does not deform up to a temperature of 207 C. Alternatively the mold may be capable of sterilization using gases e.g. ethyleneoxide. The mold may be capable of sterilization using radiation e.g. radiation. The mold may be capable of sterilization using hydrogen peroxide or other chemical means. The mold may be capable of sterilization using any one or more methods of sterilization known in the art or developed in the future.

A wide variety of materials capable of hardening in situ include polymers that can be triggered to undergo a phase change for example polymers that are liquid or semi liquid and harden to solids or gels upon exposure to air application of ultraviolet light visible light exposure to blood water or other ionic changes. Any biocompatible material that is sufficiently flowable to permit it to be delivered to the joint and there undergo complete cure in situ under physiologically acceptable conditions can be used. The material can also be biodegradable.

The curable materials can be used in conjunction with a surgical tool as described herein. For example the surgical tool can be a template that includes one or more apertures therein adapted to receive injections and the curable materials can be injected through the apertures. Prior to solidifying in situ the materials will conform to the articular surface subchondral bone and or articular cartilage facing the surgical tool and accordingly will form a negative impression of the surface upon hardening thereby recreating a normal or near normal articular surface.

In addition curable materials or surgical tools can also be used in conjunction with any of the imaging tests and analysis described herein for example by molding these materials or surgical tools based on an image of a joint. For example rapid prototyping may be used to perform automated construction of the template. The rapid prototyping may include the use of without limitation 3D printers stereolithography machines or selective laser sintering systems. Rapid prototyping is a typically based on computer aided manufacturing CAM . Although rapid prototyping traditionally has been used to produce prototypes they are now increasingly being employed to produce tools or even to manufacture production quality parts. In an exemplary rapid prototyping method a machine reads in data from a CAD drawing and lays down successive millimeter thick layers of plastic or other engineering material and in this way the template can be built from a long series of cross sections. These layers are glued together or fused often using a laser to create the cross section described in the CAD drawing.

A variety of techniques can be used to derive the shape of the template as described above. For example a few selected CT slices through the hip joint along with a full spiral CT through the knee joint and a few selected slices through the ankle joint can be used to help define the axes if surgery is contemplated of the knee joint. Once the axes are defined the shape of the subchondral bone can be derived followed by applying standardized cartilage loss.

Methodologies for stabilizing the 3D guidance templates will now be described. The 3D guide template may be stabilized using multiple surgical tools such as without limitation K wires a drill bit anchored into the bone and left within the template to stabilize it against the bone one or more convexities or cavities on the surface facing the cartilage bone stabilization against intra extra articular surfaces optionally with extenders for example from an articular surface onto an extra articular surface and or stabilization against newly placed cuts or other surgical interventions.

Specific anatomic landmarks including landmarks from one or more surfaces of a failed implant may be selected in the design and make of the 3D guide template in order to further optimize the anatomic stabilization. For example a 3D guidance template may be designed to cover portions or all off an osteophyte or bone spur in order to enhance anchoring of the 3D guide template against the underlying articular anatomy. The 3D guidance template may be designed to the shape of a trochlear or intercondylar notch and can encompass multiple anatomic areas such as a trochlea a medial and a lateral femoral condyle at the same time. In the tibia a 3D guide template may be designed to encompass a medial and lateral tibial plateau at the same time and it can optionally include the tibial spine for optimized stabilization and cross referencing. In a hip the fovea capitis may be utilized in order to stabilize a 3D guide template. Optionally the surgeon may elect to resect the ligamentum capitis femoris in order to improve the stabilization. Also in the hip an acetabular mold can be designed to extend into the region of the tri radiate cartilage the medial lateral superior inferior anterior and posterior acetabular wall or ring. By having these extensions and additional features for stabilization a more reproducible position of the 3D template can be achieved with resulted improvement in accuracy of the surgical procedure. Typically a template with more than one convexity or concavity or multiple convexities or concavities will provide better cross referencing in the anatomic surface and higher accuracy and higher stabilization than compared to a mold that has only few surface features such as a singular convexity. Thus in order to improve the implementation and intraoperative accuracy careful surgical planning and preoperative planning is desired that encompasses preferably more than one convexity more preferred more than two convexities and even more preferred more than three convexities or that encompasses more than one concavity more preferred more than two concavities or even more preferred more than three concavities on an articular surface or adjoined surface including bone and cartilage outside the weight bearing surface.

In an even more preferred embodiment more than one convexity and concavity more preferred more than two convexities and concavities and even more preferred more then three convexities and concavities are included in the surface of the mold in order to optimize the interoperative cross referencing and in order to stabilize the mold prior to any surgical intervention.

Turning now to particular 3D surgical template configurations and to templates for specific joint applications which are intended to teach the concept of the design as it would then apply to other joints in the body 

The 3D guidance template may include a surface that duplicates the inner surface of an implant an implant component a failed implant surface a revision implant surface and or that conforms to an articular surface at least partially in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. More than one of the surfaces of the template may match or conform to one or more of the surfaces or portions of one or more of these surfaces of an implant implant component and or articular surface.

In one embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint includes a portion that substantially conforms to at least portions of the surface of the joint that is healthy or substantially unaffected by the arthritic process. A recessed area can be present to avoid contact with the diseased joint region. This design can be favorable when an imaging test is used that does not provide sufficient detail about the diseased region of the joint to accurately generate a template or where information about the anatomical margins of the underlying anatomical support structure are of insufficient confidence as desired by the user operator.

In a similar embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint includes a portion that substantially conforms to at least portions of the surface of the joint that is healthy or substantially unaffected by the arthritic process. The diseased area is covered by the template but the template is not substantially in contact with it.

In another embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint includes a portion that substantially conforms to at least portions of the surface of the joint that are arthritic. The diseased area is covered by the template and the template is in close contact with it. This design can be advantageous to obtain greater accuracy in positioning the template if the arthritic area is well defined on the imaging test e.g. with high resolution spiral CT or near isotropic MRI acquisitions or MRI with image fusion. This design can also provide enhanced stability during surgical interventions by more firmly fixing the template against the irregular underlying surface.

In another embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint includes a portion that substantially conforms to at least portions of the surface of the joint that are arthritic. The diseased area is covered by the template and the template is in close contact with it. Moreover healthy or substantially normal regions are covered by the template and the template is in close contact with them. The template is also closely mirroring the shape of the interface between substantially normal or near normal and diseased joint tissue . This design can be advantageous to obtain even greater accuracy in positioning the template due to the change in surface profile or contour at the interface and resultant improved placement of the template on the joint surface. This design can also provide enhanced stability during surgical interventions by more firmly fixing and anchoring the template against the underlying surface and the interface .

The template may include guide apertures or reference points for two or more planes or at least one of a cut plane and one of a drill hole or reaming opening for a peg or implant stem in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

The distance between two opposing articulating implant components may be optimized intraoperatively for different pose angles of the joint or joint positions such as different degrees of section extension abduction adduction internal and external rotation. For example spacers typically at least partially conforming to the template may be placed between the template of the opposite surface where the opposite surface can be the native uncut joint the cut joint the surgically prepared joint the trial implant the failed implant the revision implant and or any other implant component for that articular surface. Alternatively spacers may be placed between the template and the articular surface for which it will enable subsequent surgical interventions. For example by placing spacers between a tibial template and the tibia the tibial cut height can be optimized. The thicker the spacer or the more spacers interposed between the tibial template and the tibial plateau the less deep the cut will be i.e. the less bone will be removed from the top of the tibia.

The spacers may be non conforming to the template e.g. they may be of a flat nature. The spacers may be convex or concave or include multiple convexities or concavities. The spacers may be partially conforming to the template. For example in one embodiment the surface of the spacer optionally facing the articular surface can be molded and individualized to the articular surface thereby forming a template mold while the opposite surface of the spacer can be flat or curved or have any other non patient specific design. The opposite surface may allow for placement of blocks or other surgical instruments or for linkages to other surgical instruments and measurement devices.

In another embodiment the template may include multiple slots spaced at equal distance or at variable distances wherein these slots allow to perform cuts at multiple cut heights or cut depths that can be decided on intraoperatively. In another embodiment the template may include a ratchet like mechanism wherein the ratchet can be placed between the articular surface and the template or between the template and the opposite surface wherein the opposite surface may include the native uncut opposite surface the cut opposite surface an opposite surface template a trial implant or the implant component designed for the opposite surface. By using a ratchet like device soft tissue tension can be optimized for example for different pose angles of the joint or joint positions such as flexion extension abduction adduction internal rotation and external rotation at one or more degrees for each direction.

Optimizing soft tissue tension will improve joint function that advantageously enhances postoperative performance. Soft tissue tension may for example be optimized with regard to ligament tension or muscle tension but also capsular tension. In the knee joint soft tissue tension optimization includes typically ligament balancing e.g. the cruciate ligaments and or the collateral ligaments for different degrees of knee flexion and knee extension.

In a preferred embodiment a 3D guidance template may attach to two or more points on the joint and or implant component. In an even more preferred embodiment a template may attach to three or more points even more preferred four or more points even more preferred five or more points even more preferred six or more points even more preferred seven or more points even more preferred ten or more points even more preferred portions for the entire surface to be replaced.

In another embodiment the template may include one or more linkages for surgical instruments. The linkages may also be utilized for attaching other measurement devices such as alignment guides intramedullary guides laser pointing devices laser measurement devices optical measurement devices radio frequency measurement devices surgical navigation and the like. Someone skilled in the art will recognize many surgical instruments and measurement in alignment devices may be attached to the template. Alternatively these surgical instruments or alignment devices may be included within the template.

In another embodiment a link or a linkage may be attached or may be incorporated or may be part of a template that rests on a first articular or implant surface. Said link or linkage may further extend to a second articular or implant surface which is typically an opposing articular surface. Said link or linkage can thus help cross reference the first surface with the second surface ultimately assisting the performance of surgical interventions on the second surface using the cross reference to the first surface. The second surface may optionally be cut with a second template. Alternatively the second surface may be cut using a standard surgical instrument non individualized that is cross referenced via the link to the surgical mold placed on the first surface. The link or linkage may include adjustment means such as ratchets telescoping devices and the like to optimize the spatial relationship between the first surface and the second opposing articular surface. This optimization may be performed for different degrees of joint flexion extension abduction adduction and rotation.

In another embodiment the linkage may be made to the cut articular surface or more general an articular surface that has been altered using a template and related surgical intervention. Thus cross reference can be made from the first articular surface from a mold attached to said first articular surface the mold attached to a surgically altered for example cut articular surface the surgical instrument attached to said articular surface altered using the mold e.g. cut or drilled and the like. Someone skilled in the art will easily recognize multiple different variations of this approach. Irrespective of the various variations in a first step the articular surface is surgically altered for example via cutting drilling or reaming using a mold while in the second step cross reference is established with a second articular surface.

By establishing cross reference between said first and said second articular surface either via the template and or prior to or after a surgical intervention the surgical intervention performed on the second articular surface can be performed using greater accuracy and improved usability in relation to said articulating opposing first articular surface.

A fourth template may optionally be used in order to perform an anterior chamfer cut . The fourth template may have a guide aperture or reference plane that can determine the anterior chamfer cut . The fourth template can but must not have at least one surface matching one or more cut articular surfaces . The fourth template may have one or more outriggers or extenders stabilizing the template against the cut or uncut articular surface.

A fifth template may optionally be used to perform a anterior chamfer cut . The fifth template may have a guide aperture or reference plane that can determine the posterior chamfer cut . The fifth template may have at least one surface matching one or more cut articular surfaces . Oblique planes may help to further stabilize the template during the procedure. The fifth template may have one or more outriggers or extenders stabilizing the template against the cut or uncut articular surface.

In another embodiment an opposite articular side may be cut in reference to a first articular side . Any order or sequence of cutting is possible femur first then tibia tibia first then femur patella first and so forth. A template may be shaped to the uncut or in this example cut first articular side. The template may have stabilizers against the first articular surface for example with extenders into a previously created peg hole for an implant. The template may have a linkage or an extender to a second articular surface . Surgical instruments may be attached to the linkage or extender . In this example a tibial cut guide with multiple apertures or reference planes for a horizontal tibial cut is attached. The tibial cut guide may but may not have a surface matching the tibial surface.

By referencing a first e.g. femoral to a second e.g. tibial cut greater accuracy can be achieved in the alignment of these cuts which will result in improved implant component alignment and less wear. Ratchet like devices or hinge like devices or spacers may be inserted into the space between the first and the second articular surface and soft tissue tension and ligament balancing can be evaluated for different distances achieved between the first and second articular surface with one or more of them being cut or uncut. In this manner soft tissue tension and ligament balancing can be tested during different pose angles e.g. degrees of flexion or extension. Optionally tensiometers can be used. Once an ideal soft tissue tension and or ligament balancing has been achieved the tibial cut may be performed through one of the guide apertures in reference to the femoral cut.

This disclosure optionally provides for trial implants and trial devices that help test intraoperatively the result of the surgical intervention achieved using the 3D guidance mold. Trial implants or devices can be particularly useful for subsequent adjustments and fine tuning of the surgical intervention for example optimizing soft tissue tension in different articular pose angles.

In another embodiment the templates may also allow for intraoperative adjustments. For example the template may include an opening for a pin. The pin can be placed in the bone and the template can be rotated around the pin thereby optimizing for example medial and lateral ligament tension in a knee joint or thereby optimizing the cut orientation and resultant rotation and alignment of an implant relative to the anatomic or mechanical axis.

In another embodiment standard tools including alignment guides may be attached to the mold via linkages for example and the attachment can allow for additional adjustments in mold and subsequently implant alignment and rotation.

The above described embodiments can be particularly useful for optimization of soft tissue tension including ligament balancing for example in a knee joint. Optimization of soft tissue tension can advantageously improve post operative function and range of motion.

Linkages may also be utilized to stabilize and fix additional molds or surgical instruments on the articular surface.

Moreover linkages can allow separation of one large mold into multiple smaller molds. The use of multiple smaller linked molds advantageously enable smaller surgical axis with the potential to enhance muscle sparing and to reduce the size of the skin cut.

In another embodiment all or portions of the template may be made of metal metal alloys teflon ceramics. In a more preferred embodiment metal metal alloys teflon ceramics and other hard materials typically materials that offer a hardness of without limitation greater than shore 60D is placed in areas where the surgical instruments will be in contact with the template.

3D guidance templates may also be utilized to treat impingement syndromes for example by template guided removal of osteophytes or exophytic bone growth. In one embodiment an imaging test such as a CT scan or an MRI scan is obtained through the area of concern. If a joint is imaged the images can demonstrate an osteophyte or more generally exophytic bone growth in intra and extra articular locations. The scan data may then be utilized to design a template that matches the surface adjacent to the exophytic bone growth or osteophyte the surface overlying the exophytic bone growth or osteophyte or both or portions of one or both. The template may have openings or apertures or linkages that allow placement of surgical tools for removal of the exophytic bone growth or the osteophyte such as reamers drills rotating blades and the like. Someone skilled in the art will recognize many different surgical instruments that can be utilized in this manner.

Two representative examples where a 3D guidance template can be applied to treat local impingement syndromes are the pincer and Cam impingement syndromes in the hip joint. Pincer and Cam impingement represent femoro acetabular impingement syndromes caused by an abutment between the proximal femur and the acetabular rim during the end range of motion. Untreated femoral acetabular impingement can cause osteoarthritis of the hip.

In Cam impingement a non spherical portion of the femoral head typically located near the head neck junction is jammed into the acetabulum during hip joint motion. The Cam impingement can lead to considerable shear forces and subsequently chondral erosion.

In one embodiment an imaging test such as a CT scan or MRI scan may be performed pre operatively. The imaging test may be used to identify the non spherical portion of the femoral head at the head neck junction that is responsible for the impingement. A 3D guidance template may be designed that can be applied intraoperatively to this region. The template is designed to fulfill three principle functions 

1. Intraoperative highly accurate identification of the non spherical portion of the femoral head by placement of the individualized portion of the 3D template onto the area or immediately adjacent to the area.

2. Guidance of surgical instrumentation to remove the non spherical portion and to re establish a spherical or essentially spherical shape.

3. Control of the depth of the bone removal and the shape of the bone removal. For this purpose a stop may be incorporated into the design of the 3D guidance template. Of note the stop may be asymmetrical and can even be designed to have a shape that is substantially a negative of the desired articular contour.

In Pincer impingement linear bony contact occurs between the normal femoral head neck junction and enlarged or hypertrophied portion of the acetabulum. Pre operatively an imaging test may be performed in order to identify the abnormal over covered or enlarged area of the acetabulum. The amount of bone removal may be determined on the imaging study e.g. a CT scan or MRI scan. A 3D guidance template may then be designed that will achieve the identical three functions described above in Cam impingement.

Accurate and reproducible identification of the abnormal bony surface causing the impingement is critical in any form of musculoskeletal impingement syndrome. 3D guidance template systems are ideally suited to achieve this purpose and to guide the surgical instrumentation for removal of the source of impingement. Moreover since the localization of the impinging area is performed pre operatively during the imaging test and intra operatively using the 3D guidance template this approach allows for minimally invasive tissue specifically muscle sparing approaches.

3D guidance template technology as described herein may be combined with surgical navigation techniques. Surgical navigation techniques may be image guided or non image guided for this purpose. Passive or active surgical navigation systems may be employed. Surgical navigation systems that use optical or radiofrequency transmission or registration may be used. A representative example is the Vector Vision navigation system manufactured by Brain Lab Germany. This is a passive infrared navigation system. Once the patient is positioned appropriately in the operating room retro reflective markers can be applied to the extremity near the area of intended surgery. With image guided navigation an imaging study such as a CT scan or MRI scan can be transferred into the workstation of the navigation system. For registration purposes the surgeon can for example utilize a pointer navigation tool to touch four or more reference points that are simultaneously co identified and cross registered on the CT or MRI scan on the workstation. In the knee joint reference points may include the trochlear groove the most lateral point of the lateral condyle the most medial femoral condyle the tip of the tibial spines and so forth. Using image guided navigation anatomical and mechanical axis of the joint can be determined reliably.

Alternatively non image guided navigation may be utilized. In this case retro reflective markers or small radio frequency transmitters are positioned on the extremity. Movement of the extremity and of the joints is utilized for example to identify the center of rotation. If surgery of the knee joint is contemplated the knee joint may be rotated around the femur. The marker or radiofrequency transmitter motion may be utilized to identify the center of the rotation which will coincide with the center of the femoral head. In this manner the mechanical axis may be determined non invasively.

The information resulting in imaging guided navigation pertaining to either anatomical or mechanical axis can be may be utilized to optimize the position of any molds blocks linkages or surgical instruments attached to or guided through the 3D guidance molds.

In one embodiment the joint or more specifically the articular surface may be scanned intra operatively for example using ultrasound or optical imaging methods. The optical imaging methods may include stereographic or stereographic like imaging approaches for example multiple light path stereographic imaging of the joint and the articular surface or even single light path 3D optical imaging. Other scan technologies that are applicable are for example C arm mounted fluoroscopic imaging systems that can optionally also be utilized to generate cross sectional images such as a CT scan. Intraoperative CT scanners are also applicable. Utilizing the intraoperative scan a point cloud of the joint or the articular surface or a 3D reconstruction or a 3D visualization and other 3D representations may be generated that can be utilized to generate an individualized template wherein at least a portion of said template includes a surface that includes a portion that substantially conforms to the joint e.g. including non articular surface portions or the articular surface. A rapid prototyping or a milling or other manufacturing machine can be available in or near the operating room and the 3D guidance template may be generated intraoperatively.

The intraoperative scan in conjunction with the rapid production of an individualized 3D guidance template matching the joint or the articular surface in whole or at least in part has the advantage to generate rapidly a tool for rapid intraoperative localization of anatomical landmarks including articular landmarks. A 3D guidance template may then optionally be cross registered for example using optical markers or radiofrequency transmitters attached to the template with the surgical navigation system. By cross referencing the 3D guidance template with the surgical navigation system surgical instruments can now be reproducibly positioned in relationship to the 3D guidance template to perform subsequent procedures in alignment with or in a defined relationship to at least one or more anatomical axis and or at least one or more mechanical axis or planes.

In addition to cross sectional or volumetric imaging technologies including CT spiral CT and MRI stereoscopic imaging modalities may be utilized. Stereoscopic imaging is any technique capable of recording three dimensional information from two two dimensional projectional imaging. Traditional stereoscopic imaging includes creating a 3D visualization or representation starting from a pair of 2D images. The projection path of the 2D images is offset. The offset is for example designed to create an impression of object depth for the eyes of the viewer. The offset or minor deviation between the two images is similar to the prospectors that both eyes naturally receive inbinocular vision. Using two or more images with an offset or minor deviation in perspective it is possible to generate a point cloud or 3D surface or 3D visualization of a joint or an articular surface which can then be input into a manufacturing system such as a rapid prototyping or milling machine. Dual or more light path as well as single light path systems can be employed

When a revision procedure for a total knee arthroplasty or repair of a less than total knee implant device is contemplated the patient can undergo an imaging test as discussed in more detail above that will demonstrate the articular anatomy of the knee joint as well as the condition and image of the existing failed implant e.g. width of the femoral condyles the tibial plateau artifact images etc. Additionally other joints can be included in the imaging test thereby yielding information on femoral and tibial axes deformities such as varus and valgus and other articular alignment. The imaging test can be an x ray image preferably in standing load bearing position a CT or spiral CT scan or an MRI scan or combinations thereof. A spiral CT scan may be advantageous over a standard CT scan due to its improved spatial resolution in z direction in addition to x and y resolution. The articular surface and shape as well as alignment information generated with the imaging test along with any additional image groups and or image assessment evaluation comparison and or corrections can be used to shape the surgical assistance device to select the surgical assistance device from a library of different devices with pre made shapes and sizes or can be entered into the surgical assistance device and can be used to define the preferred location and orientation of saw guides or drill holes or guides for reaming devices or other surgical instruments. Intraoperatively the surgical assistance device is applied to the tibial plateau and subsequently the femoral condyle s by matching its surface with the articular surface and or any remaining failed implant components or by attaching it to anatomic reference points on the bone or cartilage. The surgeon can then introduce a reamer or saw through the guides and prepare the joint for the implantation. By cutting the cartilage and bone along anatomically defined planes a more reproducible placement of the implant can be achieved. This can ultimately result in improved postoperative results by optimizing biomechanical stresses applied to the implant and surrounding bone for the patient s anatomy and by minimizing axis mal alignment of the implant. In addition the surgical assistance device can greatly reduce the number of surgical instruments needed for total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Thus the use of one or more surgical assistance devices can help make joint arthroplasty more accurate improve postoperative results improve long term implant survival reduce cost by reducing the number of surgical instruments used. Moreover the use of one or more surgical assistance device can help lower the technical difficulty of the procedure and can help decrease operating room OR times.

Thus surgical tools described herein can also be designed and used to control drill alignment depth and width for example when preparing a site to receive an implant. For example the tools described herein which typically conform to the joint surface and or surfaces of the failed implant can provide for improved drill alignment and more accurate placement of any implant. An anatomically correct tool can be constructed by a number of methods and can be made of any material preferably a substantially translucent and or transparent material such as plastic Lucite silastic SLA or the like and typically is a block like shape prior to molding.

Turning now to a variety of illustrations are provided showing a tibial cutting block and mold system. illustrates the tibial cutting block in conjunction with a tibia that has not been resected. In this depiction the cutting block consists of at least two pieces. The first piece is a patient specific interior piece or mold that is designed on its inferior surface to mate or substantially mate with the existing geography of the patient s tibia . The superior surface and side surfaces of the first piece are configured to mate within the interior of an exterior piece . The reusable exterior piece fits over the interior piece . The system can be configured to hold the mold onto the bone.

The reusable exterior piece has a superior surface and an inferior surface that mates with the first piece . The reusable exterior piece includes cutting guides to assist the surgeon in performing the tibial surface cut described above. As shown herein a plurality of cutting guides can be provided to provide the surgeon a variety of locations to choose from in making the tibial cut. If necessary additional spacers can be provided that fit between the first patient configured or molded piece and the second reusable exterior piece or cutting block .

Clearly the mold may be a single component or multiple components. In a preferred embodiment one or more components are patient specific while other components such as spacers or connectors to surgical instruments are generic. In one embodiment the mold can rest on portions of the joint on the articular surface or external to the articular surface as well as on one or more surfaces or other features of the failed implant . Other surgical tools then may connect to the mold. For example a standard surgical cut block as described for standard implants for example in the knee the J J PFC Sigma system the Zimmer Nexgen system or the Stryker Duracon system can be connected or placed on the mold. In this manner the patient specific component can be minimized and can be made compatible with standard surgical instruments.

The mold may include receptacles for standard surgical instruments including alignment tools or guides. For example a tibial mold for use in knee surgery may have an extender or a receptacle or an opening to receive a tibial alignment rod. In this manner the position of the mold can be checked against the standard alignment tools and methods. Moreover the combined use of molds and standard alignment tools including also surgical navigation techniques can help improve the accuracy of or optimize component placement in joint arthroplasty such as hip or knee arthroplasty. For example the mold can help define the depth of a horizontal tibial cut for placement of a tibial component. A tibial alignment guide for example an extramedullary or intramedullary alignment guide used in conjunction with a tibial mold can help find the optimal anteroposterior angulation posterior slope tibial slant or varus valgus angle of the tibial cut. The mold may be designed to work in conjuction with traditional alignment tools known in the art.

The mold may include markers e.g. optoelectronic or radiofrequency for surgical navigation. The mold may have receptacles to which such markers can be attached either directly or via a linking member.

The molds can be used in combination with a surgical navigation system. They can be used to register the bones associated with a joint into the coordinate system of the surgical navigation system. For example if a mold for a joint surface includes tracking markers for surgical navigation the exact position and orientation of the bone can be detected by the surgical navigation system after placement of the mold in its unique position. This helps to avoid the time consuming need to acquire the coordinates of tens to hundreds of points on the joint surface for registration.

Referring back to the variable nature of the interior piece facilitates obtaining the most accurate cut despite the level of disease of the joint because it positions the exterior piece such that it can achieve a cut that is perpendicular to the mechanical axis. Either the interior piece or the exterior piece can be formed out of any of the materials discussed above in Section II or any other suitable material. Additionally a person of skill in the art will appreciate that this disclosure is not limited to the two piece configuration described herein. The reusable exterior piece and the patient specific interior piece can be a single piece that is either patient specific where manufacturing costs of materials support such a product or is reusable based on a library of substantially defect conforming shapes developed in response to known or common tibial surface sizes and defects.

The interior piece is typically molded to the tibia including the subchondral bone and or the cartilage. The surgeon will typically remove any residual meniscal tissue prior to applying the mold. Optionally the interior surface of the mold can include shape information of portions or all of the menisci.

Turning now to a variety of views of the removable exterior piece . The top surface of the exterior piece can be relatively flat. The lower surface which abuts the interior piece conforms to the shape of the upper surface of the interior piece. In this illustration the upper surface of the interior piece is flat therefore the lower surface of the reusable exterior surface is also flat to provide an optimal mating surface.

A guide plate is provided that extends along the side of at least a portion of the exterior piece . The guide plate provides one or more slots or guides through which a saw blade can be inserted to achieve the cut desired of the tibial surface. Additionally the slot or guide can be configured so that the saw blade cuts at a line perpendicular to the mechanical axis or so that it cuts at a line that is perpendicular to the mechanical axis but has a 4 7 slope in the sagittal plane to match the normal slope of the tibia.

Optionally a central bore can be provided that for example enables a drill to ream a hole into the bone for the stem of the tibial component of the knee implant.

As is evident from the views shown in and D the length of the guide plate can be such that it extends along all or part of the tibial plateau e.g. where the guide plate is asymmetrically positioned as shown in or symmetrical as in . If total knee arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the guide plate typically extends along all of the tibial plateau. If unicompartmental arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the guide plate typically extends along the length of the compartment that the surgeon will operate on. Similarly if total knee arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the molded interior piece typically extends along all of the tibial plateau it can include one or both tibial spines. If unicompartmental arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the molded interior piece typically extends along the length of the compartment that the surgeon will operate on it can optionally include a tibial spine.

Turning now to an alternative embodiment is depicted of the aperture . In this embodiment the aperture features lateral protrusions to accommodate using a reamer or punch to create an opening in the bone that accepts a stem having flanges.

As illustrated in the surface of the mold can be configured such that the upper surface forms a convex dome that fits within a concave well provided on the interior surface of the cutting block . This configuration enables greater rotational movement about the mechanical axis while limiting lateral movement or translation.

Other embodiments and configurations could be used to achieve these results without departing from the scope of the invention.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art more than two pieces can be used where appropriate to comprise the system. For example the patient specific interior piece can be two pieces that are configured to form a single piece when placed on the tibia. Additionally the exterior piece can be two components. The first component can have for example the cutting guide apertures . After the resection using the cutting guide aperture is made the exterior piece can be removed and a secondary exterior piece can be used which does not have the guide plate with the cutting guide apertures but has the aperture which facilitates boring into the tibial surface an aperture to receive a stem of the tibial component of the knee implant. Any of these designs could also feature the surface configurations shown in if desired.

Turning now to a femoral mold system is depicted that facilitates preparing the surface of the femur such that the finally implanted femoral implant will achieve optimal mechanical and anatomical axis alignment.

Turning now to the femur with a first portion of the cutting block placed on the femur and a second exterior portion placed over the first portion is illustrated. The second exterior portion features a series of rectangular grooves that facilitate inserting a saw blade therethrough to make the cuts necessary to achieve the femur shape illustrated in . These grooves can enable the blade to access at a 90 angle to the surface of the exterior portion or for example at a 45 angle. Other angles are also possible without departing from the scope of the invention.

As shown by the dashed lines the grooves of the second portion overlay the apertures of the first layer.

Similar to the designs discussed above with respect to alternative designs can be used to control the movement and rotation of the cutting block relative to the mold . As shown in a series of protrusions illustrated as pegs are provided that extend from the superior surface of the mold. These pegs or protrusions can be telescoping to facilitate the use of molds if necessary. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art one or more pegs or protrusions can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. For purposes of illustration two pegs have been shown in . Depending on the control desired the pegs are configured to fit within for example a curved slot that enables rotational adjustment similar to the slots illustrated in or within a recess that conforms in shape to the peg similar to that shown in and described with respect to the tibial cutting system. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the recess can be sized to snugly encompass the peg or can be sized larger than the peg to allow limited lateral and rotational movement.

As illustrated in the surface of the mold can be configured such that the upper surface forms a convex dome that fits within a concave well provided on the interior surface of the cutting block . This configuration enables greater rotational movement about the mechanical axis while limiting lateral movement or translation.

In installing an implant first the tibial surface is cut using a tibial block such as those shown in . The patient specific mold is placed on the femur. The knee is then placed in extension and spacers such as those shown in or shims are used if required until the joint optimal function is achieved in both extension and flexion. The spacers or shims are typically of an incremental size e.g. 5 mm thick to provide increasing distance as the leg is placed in extension and flexion. A tensiometer can be used to assist in this determination or can be incorporated into the mold or spacers in order to provide optimal results. The design of tensiometers are known in the art and are not included herein to avoid obscuring the invention. Suitable designs include for example those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 630 820 to Todd issued May 20 1997.

As illustrated in sagittal view and O coronal view the interior surface of the mold can include small teeth or extensions that can help stabilize the mold against the cartilage or subchondral bone .

3D guidance templates may be used to create more that one cut on the same and or on the opposite articular surface or opposite articular bone in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. These cuts may be cross referenced with other cuts using one or more guidance template s .

In accordance with one embodiment the 3D guidance template s are utilized to perform more than one cut on the same articular side such as the femoral side of a knee joint. In another embodiment a 3D guidance template may be utilized to cross reference surgical interventions on an opposing articular surface. In a knee for example the first articular surface can be the femoral surface. The opposing articular surface can be the tibial surface or the patella surface. In a hip the first articular surface can be the acetabulum. The opposing articular surface or the opposing bone can be the proximal femur.

Thus in a knee a horizontal femur cut can be cross referenced with an anterior or posterior femur cut or optionally also chamfer oblique cuts. Similarly a tibial horizontal cut can be cross referenced with any tibial oblique or vertical cuts on the same articular side or surface.

In accordance with another embodiment one or more femur cuts can be crossed referenced with one or more tibial cuts. Or in a hip one or more acetabular cuts or surgical interventions can be cross referenced with one or more femoral cuts or surgical interventions such as drilling reaming or boring. Similarly in a knee again one or more femur cuts can be cross referenced with one or more patella cuts. Any combination and order is possible.

The cross referencing can occur via attachments or linkages including spacers or hinge or ratchet like devices from a first articular bone cartilage and or implant surface to a second articular bone and or cartilage surface. The resulting positioning of the cut on the opposing articular bone or cartilage surface can be optimized by testing the cut for multiple pose angles or joint positions such as flexion extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction. Thus for example in a knee a distal femur cut can be performed with a mold. Via a linkage or an attachment a tibial template may be attached thereto or to the cut or other surgical intervention thus a cross reference can be related from the femoral cut to a tibial cut or other surgical intervention. Cross referencing from a first articular surface to a second articular surface via without limitation attachments or linkages to a template has the advantage of insuring an optimal alignment between the implant or other therapeutic device components of the first articular surface to that on a second articular surface. Moreover by cross referencing surgical interventions on a first surface to a second articular surface improved efficiencies and time savings can be obtained with the resulted surgical procedure.

Cross referencing the first the second and optionally a third or more articular surface such as in a knee joint may be performed with a single linkage or attachment or multiple linkages or attachments. A single pose angle or position of a joint or multiple pose angles or positions of a joint may be tested and optimized during the entire surgical intervention. Moreover any resulting surgical interventions on the opposite second articular surface bone or cartilage may be further optimized by optionally cross referencing to additional measurement tools such as standard alignment guides.

For example in a knee joint a 3D template may be utilized to perform one or more surgical interventions on the femoral side such as a femoral cut. This can then be utilized via a linkage an attachment or via indirect cross referencing directly onto the site of surgical intervention to guide a surgical intervention such as a cut of the tibial side. Prior to performing the surgical intervention on the tibial side a traditional tibial alignment guide with cross reference to the medial and lateral malleolus of the ankle turn may be used to optimize the position orientation and or depth and extent of the planned surgical intervention such as the cut. For example cross referencing to the femoral cut can aid in defining the relative superior inferior height of the tibial cut while cross referencing a tibial alignment guide can optionally be utilized to determine the slant of the cut in the interior posterior direction.

An exemplary system and methodology is now described in which a femoral template is used to make a cut on the femur which is then cross referenced to properly align a tibial template for making a cut on the tibial plateau. Initially an electronic image s of the leg is obtained using imaging techniques elaborated in above described embodiments. For example a pre operative CT scan of a patient s leg may be obtained to obtain electronic image data.

Image processing is then applied to the image data to derive without limitation relevant joint surfaces axis and or cut planes. Image processing techniques may include without limitation segmentation and propagation of point clouds.

Relevant biomechanical and or anatomical axis data may be obtained by identifying for example the central femoral head central knee joint and center of the distal tibia. The cutting planes may then be defined based on at least one of these axis. For example the tibial implant bearing surface may be defined as being perpendicular to the axis defined by the center of the tibial plateau and the center of the distal tibia as illustrated in the tibial implant s medial margin may project towards the femoral head as illustrated in and the anterior to posterior slope of the tibia may be approximated by the natural anatomical slope alternatively excessive tibial slope may be corrected .

The tibial and femoral templates and implants may be designed based at least in part on the derived joint surfaces axis and or cut planes. show isometric views of a femoral template and a tibial template respectively in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The femoral template has an interior surface that in various embodiments conforms or substantially conforms with the anatomic surface bone and or cartilage of the femur . Furthermore the interior surface of the femoral template may extend a desired amount around the anatomical bony surfaces of the condyle to further ensure proper fixation. The interior surface of the tibial cutting block may conform or substantially conform to the surface bone and or cartilage of the tibia .

In an exemplary use the femoral template is placed on the femoral condyle for example when the knee is flexed. The femoral template may be fixed to the femoral condyle using without limitation anchoring screws drill pins inserted through drill bushing holes and . The position of holes and on the condyle may be the same used to anchor the final implant to the femur. In various embodiments the holes and may include metal inserts bushings to prevent degradation when drilling. Fixing the template to the femoral condyle advantageously prevents movement of the template during subsequent cutting or other surgical interventions thereby ensuring the accuracy of the resultant surgical cuts.

To assist in accurately positioning the femoral template a femoral guide reference tool may be attached to the femoral template as shown in . The femoral guide reference tool may without limitation attach to one of holes and . The femoral guide reference tool may reference off the tangential margin of the posterior condyle and aid for example in correct anterior posterior positioning of the femoral template .

Upon proper fixation of the femoral template to the femoral condyle a cut to the femoral condyle is made using cut guide surface or element . The cut guide surface or element may be integral to the femoral template or may be an attachment to the femoral template with the attachment made of a harder material than the femoral template . For example the cut guide surface or element may be a metal tab that slides onto the femoral template which may be made without limitation of a softer plastic material.

Upon making the femoral cut and removing the femoral template a sample implant template not the final implant is optionally positioned on the condyle as shown in in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The sample implant template may be attached to the condyle by using without limitation anchoring screws drill pins inserted through the same holes used to anchor the final implant to the femur.

The sample implant template includes an attachment mechanism for attaching the tibial template thereby cross referencing the placement of the distal tibial cut with respect to the femoral cut implant s placement. The attachment mechanism may be without limitation a boss as shown in or other attachment mechanism known in the art such as a snap fit mechanism. Note that in alternative embodiments a sample implant template is not required. For example the tibial template may attach directly to the femoral template . However in the subject embodiment the drill bushing features of the femoral template will interfere with the knee going into extension preventing the tibial cut.

In illustrative embodiments the thickness of the sample implant template may not only include the thickness of the final femoral implant but may include an additional thickness that corresponds to a preferred joint space between tibial and femoral implants. For example the additional thickness may advantageously provide a desired joint space identified for proper ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion.

Thus the tibial template used on the tibia can be cross referenced to the femoral template femoral cut and or sample implant . Similarly in the hip femoral templates can be placed in reference to an acetabular mold or vice versa. In general when two or more articular surfaces will be repaired or replaced a template can be placed on one or more of them and surgical procedures including cutting drilling sawing or rasping can be performed on the other surface or other surfaces in reference to said first surface s .

In illustrative embodiments three dimensional guidance templates may be utilized to determine an optimized implant rotation. Examples are provided below with reference to the knee however it is to be understood that optimizing implant rotation may be applied other joints as well.

The optimal rotation of a femoral component or femoral implant for a uni compartmental patello femoral replacement or total knee replacement may be ascertained in a number of different ways. Implant rotation is typically defined using various anatomic axes or planes. These anatomic axes may include without limitation the transepicondylar axis the Whiteside line i.e. the trochlea anteroposterior axis which is typically perpendicular to at least one of the cuts and or the posterior condylar axis. Another approach for optimizing femoral component rotation is a so called balancing gap technique. With the balancing gap technique a femoral cut is made parallel to the tibia i.e. the tibia is cut first typically. Prior to performing the femoral cut the femoral cut plate is optimized so that the medial and lateral ligament and soft tissue tension are approximately equal.

By measuring the relevant anatomic axis or planes the optimal implant rotation may be determined. The measurement may be factored into the shape position or orientation of the 3D guidance template in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Any resultant surgical interventions including cuts drilling or sawings are then made incorporating this measurement thereby achieving an optimal femoral component rotation.

Moreover in order to achieve an optimal balancing the rotation of the template may be changed so that the cuts are parallel to the tibial cut with substantially equal tension medially and laterally applied.

A 3D guidance template may also be utilized to optimize tibial component rotation for uni compartmental or total knee replacements in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Tibial component rotation may be measured using a number of different approaches known in the art. In one example of a tibial component rotation measurement the anteroposterior axis of the tibia is determined. For a total knee replacement the tibial component can be placed so that the axis of the implant coincides with the medial one third of the tibial tuberosity. This approach works well when the tibia is symmetrical.

In another embodiment the symmetrical tibial component is placed as far as possible posterolateral and externally rotated so that the posteromedial corner of the tibial plateau is uncovered to an extent of between three 3 and five 5 millimeters.

The above examples are only representative of the different approaches that have been developed in the literature. Clearly other various anatomic axis plane and area measurements may be performed in order to optimize implant rotation.

In illustrative embodiments these measurements may be factored into the design of a 3D guidance template and the position shape or orientation of the 3D guidance template may be optimized utilizing this information. Thus any subsequent surgical intervention such as cutting sawing and or drilling will result in an optimized implant rotation for example in the horizontal or in a near horizontal plane.

Turning now to a variety of illustrations are provided showing a patellar cutting block and mold system. illustrates the patellar cutting block in conjunction with a patella that has not been resected. In this depiction the cutting block can consist of only one piece or a plurality of pieces if desired. The inner surface is patient specific and designed to mate or substantially mate with the existing geography of the patient s patella . Small openings are present to accept the saw. The mold or block can have only one or multiple openings. The openings can be larger than the saw in order to allow for some rotation or other fine adjustments. is a view in the sagittal plane S. The quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon are shown.

The second reusable exterior piece or cutting block can have grooves and extensions designed to mate with surgical instruments such as a patellar clamp . The patellar clamp can have ring shaped graspers and locking mechanisms for example ratchet like . The opening in the grasper fits onto the extension of the second reusable exterior piece . Portions of a first portion of the handle of the grasper can be at an oblique angle relative to the second portion of the handle or curved not shown in order to facilitate insertion. Typically the portion of the grasper that will be facing towards the intra articular side will have an oblique or curved shaped thereby allowing a slightly smaller incision.

The variable nature of the interior piece facilitates obtaining the most accurate cut despite the level of disease of the joint because it positions the exterior piece in the desired plane. Either the interior piece or the exterior piece can be formed out of any of the materials discussed above in Section II or any other suitable material. Additionally a person of skill in the art will appreciate that this disclosure is not limited to the two piece configuration described herein. The reusable exterior piece and the patient specific interior piece can be a single piece that is either patient specific where manufacturing costs of materials support such a product or is reusable based on a library of substantially defect conforming shapes developed in response to known or common tibial surface sizes and defects.

The interior piece is typically molded to the patella including the subchondral bone and or the cartilage.

From this determination an understanding of the amount of space needed to balance the knee is determined and an appropriate number of spacers is then used in conjunction with the cutting block and mold to achieve the cutting surfaces and to prevent removal of too much bone. Where the cutting block has a thickness of for example 10 mm and each spacer has a thickness of 5 mm in preparing the knee for cuts two of the spacers would be removed when applying the cutting block to achieve the cutting planes identified as optimal during flexion and extension. Similar results can be achieved with ratchet or jack like designs interposed between the mold and the cut guide.

Turning now to a variety of views showing sample mold and cutting block systems for use in the hip joint are shown. illustrates femur with a mold and cutting block system placed to provide a cutting plane across the femoral neck to facilitate removal of the head of the femur and creation of a surface for the hip ball prosthesis.

Various steps may be performed in order to design and make 3D guidance templates for hip implants in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

For example in an initial step a discrepancy in the length of the left leg and right leg may be determined for example in millimeters. Leg length discrepancy may be determined for example using standing x rays typically including the entire leg but also cross sectional imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.

A CT scout scan may be utilized to estimate leg length. Alternatively select image slices through the hip and ankle joint may be utilized to estimate leg length either using CT or MRI.

Pre operative planning is then performed using the image data including final image data assessed evaluated cross referenced derived and or corrected from image groups as previously described . A first 3D guidance template is designed to rest on the femoral neck. shows an example of an intended site for placement of a femoral neck mold for total hip arthroplasty. In a similar manner an existing failed implant component may be utilized as an alignment surface or surfaces alone or in combination with anatomical surfaces for preparation of the joint to receive a revision implant. A cut or saw plane integrated into this template can be derived. The position shape and orientation of the 3D guidance mold or jig or template may be determined on the basis of anatomical axis such as the femoral neck axis the mechanical axis and or also any underlying leg length discrepancy . Specifically the superoinferior cut or saw guide height can be adapted to account for leg length discrepancy. For example if the left leg is five 5 millimeters shorter than the right leg then the cut height can be moved by five 5 millimeters to account for this difference. The femoral neck cut height ultimately determines the position of the femoral stem. Thus in this manner using this type of pre operative planning the femoral neck cut height can be optimized using a 3D guidance template.

In the acetabulum the position and orientation of the acetabular component or acetabular cup is also critical for the success of hip surgery. For example the lowest portion of the acetabular cup may be placed so that it is five 5 millimeters lateral to an anatomic landmark on a pelvic x ray coinciding with the inferior border of the radiographic tear drop. If the acetabular component is for example placed too far superiorly significant bone may be lost.

Placing the acetabular component using the 3D guidance template may include for example the following steps 

Step Two Determining the anterior rotation of the acetabulum and the desired rotation of the acetabular cup.

The template may be optionally designed to rest primarily on the margin of the acetabular fossa. In this manner it is possible to ream through the template.

For purposes of reaming the template may be fixed to the pelvis for example using metal spikes or K wires. The template may also have a grip for fixing it to the bone. Thus a surgeon may optionally press the template against the bone while a second surgeon will perform the reaming through the opening in the template. The grip or any stabilizers can extend laterally and optionally serve as tissue retractors keeping any potentially interfering soft tissue out of the surgical field. The template may also include stoppers to avoid over penetration of the reamer. These stoppers may be designed in the form of metal stops defining the deepest penetration area for the peripheral portion or other portions of the reamer. Optionally the template may also taper and decrease in inner radius thereby creating a stop once the reamer once the reaches the innermost portion of the template. Any stop known in the art can be used. The imaging test can be used to design or shape the mold in a manner that will help achieve the optimal reaming depth. The stops can be placed on the mold or reamer in reference to the imaging test in order to achieve the optional reaming depth.

A 3D guidance template may be utilized to optimize the anteversion of the acetabular cup. For example with the posteriolateral approach typically an anteversion of forty to forty five degrees is desired in both males and females. With an anterolateral approach zero degrees anteversion may be desired. Irrespective of the desired degree of anti version the shape orientation and or position of the template may be optimized to include the desired degree of anteversion.

Similarly on the femoral side the 3D guidance template may be optimized with regard to its shape orientation and position in order to account for neutral varus or valgus position of the femoral shaft. A 3D guidance template may also be utilized to optimize femoral shaft anteversion.

Thus after a first template has been utilized for performing the femoral neck cut and a second template has been utilized for performing the surgical intervention on the acetabular side a third template may optionally be utilized to be placed onto the femoral cut.

Optionally modular hip implant components may be utilized such as a modular stem. Such modular designs can be helpful in further optimizing the resultant femoral anteversion by selecting for example different stem shapes.

In another embodiment the surgeon may perform a femur first technique wherein a first cut is applied to the femur using a first 3D guidance mold. Optionally the broach in the cut femoral shaft may be left in place. Optionally a trial implant head may be applied to the broach. The trial implant head may be variable in radius and superoinferior diameter and may be utilized to determine the optimal soft tissue tension. Optionally the trial head may also be utilized to determine the acetabular cup position wherein said acetabular cup position is derived on the basis of the femoral cut. Thus the acetabular position can be optionally derived using the opposite articular surface. In a reverse acetabulum first technique the acetabulum can be prepared first and using soft tissue balancing techniques the femoral component can be placed in reference to the acetabular component. Optionally the femoral cut may even be placed intentionally too proximal and is subsequently optimized by measuring soft tissue tension utilizing various trial heads with the option to then change the height of the optimal femoral cut.

In an illustrative embodiment in order to make a guidance template reliably and reproducibly a portion of the joint is identified in a first step wherein said portion of the joint has not been altered by the arthritic process. In a second step the surface or a point cloud of said portion of the joint is derived and may optionally be used to derive a virtual 3D model and in a third step to generate a physical model as part of the guidance template. Using a portion of the joint that has not been altered by the arthritic process can advantageously improve the reproducibility and the accuracy of the resultant mold or jig or template. In a similar manner the use of existing feature s of a failed implant may be useful for alignment of the template as described herein.

The step of identifying said portion of the joint may be visual semiautomatic or fully automatic. Anatomic models may assist in the process. Anatomic reference standards may be utilized.

As known in the art various methods for image segmentation may be used to derive the point cloud or the surface. Suitable algorithms include for example but are not limited to snakes live wire thresholding active contours deformable models and the like. Artificial neural networks may be employed to improve the accuracy of the molds.

In another embodiment the current mechanical axis may determined or estimated in a first step. In a second step the desired mechanical axis is determined. In a third step adjustments for example via change in slot position or position for openings for saws and drills and the like may be made to alter the cut or drill position in order to correct the mechanical axis in a fourth step. In a fifth step the position of the slot or openings for saws and drills and the like may be adjusted for ligament balancing and or for optimizing flexion and extension gap. This adjustment may be performed in the 3D model prior to the manufacturing process. Alternatively adjustments may be made intraoperatively for example via spacers or ratchet like devices or pins to allow for some degree of rotation.

In another embodiment at least a portion of the surface of the mold or jig or template is derived from a portion of the joint and or implant that is affected by the arthritic process. Optionally adjustment means can be performed for example via the software to simulate a normal shape. The difference between the actual shape and the adjusted shape can be utilized to optimize the position of the slots or openings in the mold or template or jig.

In a preferred embodiment at least a portion of the surface of the mold or jig or template that is in contact with the joint may be derived from a portion of the joint that is affected by the arthritic process and a portion of the joint that has not been altered by the arthritic process. By spanning both normal and diseased portions of the joint the interface between normal and diseased portions of the joint is included in the surface of the mold. The interface between normal and diseased portions of the joint is typically characterized by a sudden change in contour or shape e.g. a reduction in cartilage thickness a change in subchondral bone contour a cyst or a bone spur. This change in joint contour or shape provides additional reference points for accurately placing the mold or jig or template. In addition this change in joint contour or shape provides also additional stabilization or fixation of the mold or jig or template on the surface of the joint in particular while performing surgical interventions such as cutting drilling or sawing.

The design is proposed such that the guide is molded to precisely fit the anatomy of the articular surface of the patella for each patient thus providing precise location of the patella planing needed. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art while an exact or precise fit is desired deviations from a precise fit can occur without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus it is anticipated that a certain amount of error in the design can be tolerated.

After identification of the cartilage defect and marking of the skin surface using the proprietary U shaped cartilage defect locator device as described herein a 3 cm incision is placed and the tissue retractors are inserted. The cartilage defect is visualized.

A first Lucite block matching the 3D surface of the femoral condyle is placed over the cartilage defect. The central portion of the Lucite block contains a drill hole with an inner diameter of for example 1.5 cm corresponding to the diameter of the base plate of the implant. A standard surgical drill with a drill guide for depth control is inserted through the Lucite block and the recipient site is prepared for the base component of the implant. The drill and the Lucite block are then removed.

A second Lucite block of identical outer dimensions is then placed over the implant recipient site. The second Lucite block has a rounded cylindrical extension matching the size of the first drill hole and matching the shape of the base component of the implant with a diameter 0.1 mm smaller than the first drill hole and 0.2 mm smaller than that of the base of the implant. The cylindrical extension is placed inside the first drill hole.

The second Lucite block contains a drill hole extending from the external surface of the block to the cylindrical extension. The inner diameter of the second drill hole matches the diameter of the distal portion of the fin shaped stabilizer strut of the implant e.g. 3 mm. A drill e.g. with 3 mm diameter with a drill guide for depth control is inserted into the second hole and the recipient site is prepared for the stabilizer strut with a four fin and step design. The drill and the Lucite block are then removed.

A plastic model trial implant matching the 3 D shape of the final implant with a diameter of the base component of 0.2 mm less than that of the final implant and a cylindrical rather than tapered strut stabilizer with a diameter of 0.1 mm less than the distal portion of the final implant is then placed inside the cartilage defect. The plastic model trial implant is used to confirm alignment of the implant surface with the surrounding cartilage. The surgeon then performs final adjustments.

The implant is subsequently placed inside the recipient site. The anterior fin of the implant is marked with red color and labeled A. The posterior fin is marked green with a label P and the medial fin is color coded yellow with a label M. The Lucite block is then placed over the implant. A plastic hammer is utilized to advance the implant slowly into the recipient site. A press fit is achieved with help of the tapered and four fin design of the strut as well as the slightly greater diameter 0.1 mm of the base component relative to the drill hole. The Lucite block is removed. The tissue retractors are then removed. Standard surgical technique is used to close the 3 cm incision. The same procedure described above for the medial femoral condyle can also be applied to the lateral femoral condyle the medial tibial plateau the lateral tibial plateau and the patella. Immediate stabilization of the device can be achieved by combining it with bone cement if desired.

Also described herein are kits comprising one or more of the methods systems and or compositions described herein. In particular a kit can include one or more of the following instructions methods of obtaining electronic images systems or instructions for evaluating electronic images one or more computer means capable of analyzing or processing the electronic images and or one or more surgical tools for implanting an articular repair system. For example a kit may include an articular repair system e.g. one or more implant components designed made selected engineered or adapted for a patient and one or more single use surgical tools that facilitate placement of the articular repair system into the patient.

The following examples are included to more fully illustrate the present invention. Additionally these examples provide preferred embodiments of this disclosure and are not meant to limit the scope thereof.

Areas of cartilage are imaged as described herein to detect areas of cartilage loss and or diseased cartilage. The margins and shape of the cartilage and subchondral bone adjacent to the diseased areas are determined. The thickness of the cartilage is determined. The size of the articular repair system is determined based on the above measurements. In particular the repair system is either selected based on best fit from a catalogue of existing pre made implants with a range of different sizes and curvatures or custom designed using CAD CAM technology. The library of existing shapes is typically on the order of about 30 sizes.

The implant is a chromium cobalt implant. The articular surface is polished and the external dimensions slightly greater than the area of diseased cartilage. The shape is adapted to achieve perfect or near perfect joint congruity utilizing shape information of surrounding cartilage and underlying subchondral bone. Other design features of the implant can include a slanted 60 to 70 degree angle interface to adjacent cartilage a broad based base component for depth control a press fit design of base component a porous coating of base component for ingrowth of bone and rigid stabilization a dual peg design for large defects implant stabilization also porous coated a single stabilizer strut with tapered four fin and step design for small focal defects also porous coated and a design applicable to femoral resurfacing convex external surface and tibial resurfacing concave external surface .

The articular repair systems are inserted using arthroscopic assistance. The device does not require the 15 to 30 cm incision utilized in unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasties. The procedure is performed under regional anesthesia typically epidural anesthesia. The surgeon can apply a tourniquet on the upper thigh of the patient to restrict the blood flow to the knee during the procedure. The leg is prepped and draped in sterile technique. A stylette is used to create two small 2 mm ports at the anteromedial and the anterolateral aspect of the joint using classical arthroscopic technique. The arthroscope is inserted via the lateral port. The arthroscopic instruments are inserted via the medial port. The cartilage defect is visualized using the arthroscope. A cartilage defect locator device is placed inside the diseased cartilage. The probe has a U shape with the first arm touching the center of the area of diseased cartilage inside the joint and the second arm of the U remaining outside the joint. The second arm of the U indicates the position of the cartilage relative to the skin. The surgeon marks the position of the cartilage defect on the skin. A 3 cm incision is created over the defect. Tissue retractors are inserted and the defect is visualized.

A translucent Lucite block matching the 3D shape of the adjacent cartilage and the cartilage defect is placed over the cartilage defect. For larger defects the Lucite block includes a lateral slot for insertion of a saw. The saw is inserted and a straight cut is made across the articular surface removing an area slightly larger than the diseased cartilage. The center of the Lucite block contains two drill holes with a 7.2 mm diameter. A 7.1 mm drill with drill guide controlling the depth of tissue penetration is inserted via the drill hole. Holes for the cylindrical pegs of the implant are created. The drill and the Lucite block are subsequently removed.

A plastic model trial implant of the mini repair system matching the outer dimensions of the implant is then inserted. The trial implant is utilized to confirm anatomic placement of the actual implant. If indicated the surgeon can make smaller adjustments at this point to improve the match e.g. slight expansion of the drill holes or adjustment of the cut plane.

The implant is then inserted with the pegs pointing into the drill holes. Anterior and posterior positions of the implant are color coded specifically the anterior peg is marked with a red color and a small letter A while the posterior peg has a green color and a small letter P . Similarly the medial aspect of the implant is color coded yellow and marked with a small letter M and the lateral aspect of the implant is marked with a small letter L . The Lucite block is then placed on the external surface of the implant and a plastic hammer is used to gently advance the pegs into the drill holes. The pegs are designed to achieve a press fit.

The same technique can be applied in the tibia. The implant has a concave articular surface matching the 3D shape of the tibial plateau. Immediate stabilization of the device can be achieved by combining it with bone cement if desired.

Example 3 depicts one embodiment of a revision system method and devices contemplated by the present invention. In this embodiment a total knee implant is experiencing failure or impending failure for any number of reasons and requires surgical removal and revision to a replacement total knee implant. While the current embodiment contemplates removal and replacement of all implant components it should be understood that a partial component replacement and or implantation either of one side i.e. all of the tibial components of an implant as well as replacement and or implantation of individual failed or failing components of the implant are contemplated by the present invention.

Initially the failed implant will be assessed and diagnosed. This process typically includes non invasive imaging of the implant and the patient s anatomy usually in an attempt to determine the condition of the implant and or joint as well as to identify any discernable failure mode i.e. did the implant break did cement loosen or has the underlying anatomical structure degraded and the implant has loosened . The non invasive imaging will desirably create 2 or 3 dimensional images and or image databases of the joint and the failed implant components the failed implant images .

In addition to the failed implant images it is desirable but not absolutely necessary in all embodiments to obtain additional image sets from the patient s history see Table 1 for various exemplary image types . If desired the images can be normalized assessed evaluated cross referenced and or corrected or any combination thereof as previous described. It should be understood that such manipulation of the images may be conducted in virtually any order with various steps following other steps i.e. images may be cross referenced and then corrected or may be corrected and then cross referenced etc. . Similarly the various image processing steps may be repeated as necessary or desired such as normalizing an image then cross referencing and or correcting an image and then normalizing the processed image etc.

Once an acceptable and or accurate view of the failed implant and the underlying joint anatomy have been ascertained and or modeled as described the resulting implant and joint image information the generated image information may be used to plan the revision surgery. This generated information may be utilized to create a patient specific revision implant and or components and or may be used to choose a best fit revision implant from a series of pre manufactured and or pre designed implant components as described herein.

The generated Information may also be highly useful in assessing the failure and or success potential of the revision implant especially where such information reflects joint condition over the course of the treatment over time. Specifically the generated information may identify areas of insufficient support structure and or areas of high wear and or stress that may lead to premature failure or other undesirable wear of the revision implant. If desired this information may be utilized to modify the implant in some manner i.e. reinforce areas of higher stress and or wear or reduce the size thickness of areas that experience lower stresses or wear or may be utilized to modify the implantation procedure and or implant components.

In a similar manner the generated information may be utilized to determine if augments or other accessory structures which may or may not be secured to the revision implant and or the underlying anatomical support structure are necessary or needed for placement of surgical tool s and the revision implant. For example the various imaging and processing techniques may reveal significant osteolysis of the anatomical support structure. Desirably this osteolysis will be accounted for during the design and or selection of revision components allowing the determination of augments i.e. blocks and or wedges etc. require for proper implant placement. If desired additional augments of differing sizes and or shapes may also be provided to account for any inaccuracies or unanticipated real world conditions experienced i.e. significantly less bone support than anticipated extremely poor bone quality precluding use as support structure localized bone disease or infection fracture or bonding of support structures to the failed implant during removal etc. when the failed implant is removed and the actual anatomical support structure is revealed. Similar augments may be provided for use with the various surgical tools and molds of the present invention assisting tint the proper alignment and placement of bone cuts burring reaming drilling etc.

Once a desired revision implant has been chosen or designed the various generated information may be utilized to create surgical tools and or molds for assisting with the preparation of the revision implant site. Desirably these tools will incorporate readily accessible anatomical and or failed implant landmarks to assist with the alignment and placement of the subsequent revision implant. In at least one embodiment the tool includes at least one surface that matches or substantially conforms to an anatomical surface i.e. a cortical bone surface a subchondral bone surface a cartilage surface an osteophyte a bone void a bone defect etc. and at least a second surface matching or substantially conforming to and or resting against and or abutting in some manner one or more surfaces of the implant or implant components requiring revision which may be a component to be revised or a component that is not revised but which is adjacent to another component to be revised . If desired the tools may also assist with the removal of the failed implant i.e. locking onto the failed implant and incorporating a slap hammer connection providing a cut plane for severing portions of the failed implant sections of bone cement and or interfering anatomical structures etc. or other alignment method to assist with removal of the failed implant. In various embodiments the surgical tool and or mold will also provide an alignment guide or marker that can be utilized to place one or more preferably two or more alignment pins or wires which can provide one or more reference points for subsequent surgical steps including the placement of subsequent surgical tools after removal of the failed implant has been accomplished. Desirably the tool will allow the alignment marker s to be placed and then the tool and failed implant can be separated from the joint leaving the alignment marker s undisturbed in their desired location s for use in further steps of the surgical procedure.

Once the failed implant has been removed or while the failed implant is still attached to the joint if the relevant anatomy is accessible one or more surgical tools can be introduced along the designated alignment guides to prepare the joint for implantation of the revision implant. If desired some preparation steps may be performed before removal of the failed implant and some afterwards. In addition it is contemplated that preparation of various anatomical surfaces will allow placement of subsequent alignment tools using the newly prepared surface s for guiding further surgical tools.

Once the underlying anatomical support structure has been prepared and any augments deemed necessary have been positioned and or secured to the support structure and or to the implant surface s if necessary the revision implant may be placed into the joint and the surgery completed.

Various embodiments of this disclosure can be used for facilitate treatment of a wide variety of joints including revisions of hip joint implants. This disclosure can assist a surgeon in designing a revision implant for a failed hip joint as well as be used to assist the surgeon in selecting pre manufactured implants and or modular implant components including head and neck components for revision hip implants based on independent variables associated with physical characteristics of the implant including leg length offset and anteversion. Desirably the steps described herein can help a surgeon properly plan the revision surgery and reduce or eliminate a need to change a preoperatively chosen implant or modular component i.e. modular stem neck or other feature of the implant .

Once a set of generated data as previously described is constructed using various image sources including typical images for a hip replacement procedure which can be taken along two different directions for example anterior posterior NP and lateral pelvic images may be taken of the hip joint and appropriate image processing and evaluation steps the information may utilized to design a patient specific implant or implant components and or to select an implant and or modular components. For example the surgeon may desire a change in at least one of the variables e.g. leg length offset and or anteversion. The present method allows the surgeon to quickly and easily select a different modular neck based on an evaluation of one of the variables without requiring reevaluation of the other variables. The method can further include preoperative planning of the surgical procedure which advantageously provides an intuitive system for the surgeon both preoperatively and during surgery.

A computer system with optional user input including various criteria entered by a surgeon and or implant designer manufacturer may be used to design choose an appropriate revision implant based on anatomical constraints or a dimensional template or other implant information may be used in conjunction with the generated image s to design choose the implant and or to preoperatively plan the surgical joint revision procedure. In various embodiments the image of the failed implant may be subtracted allowing the template to be utilized directly with the generated image. In other embodiments the failed implant may remain on the image. If desired the failed implant may be identified by a color code or shading that differentiates it from the remaining anatomy. Similarly anatomical areas may be shaded color coded or otherwise identified to reflect an anticipated confidence of the accuracy of the individual anatomical features of the generated image. For example the estimated anatomical margins of the femoral canal may be shown on the image as contour lines or differing shapes or colors corresponding to confidences of 100 99 95 90 85 and so on. A surgeon can use this information to design choose an implant sized to fit within an anticipate confidence region or regions as desired by the surgeon or user. In a similar manner the use can utilize the contour lines to estimate the chances of each of a given set of implants to fit the anatomy of the generated image.

The dimensional template may be constructed of a piece of transparent plastic or other suitable material which may be overlaid on the image of the hip portion of the patient or may be an electronic image or data set that is virtually overlaid or otherwise manipulated relative to the generated image data. The dimensional template data set may include a plurality of reference points forming a grid coordinate system for example a Cartesian coordinate system including a pattern of intersecting horizontal and vertical indicators or lines that provide coordinates for locating points. A plurality or system of dimensional templates may be provided corresponding to each available size or type of hip implant and or implant component of a given hip implant system or systems.

Using generated image date of the patient s anatomical structure optionally with the failed implant components subtracted from the image the data can be utilized to select appropriate implant components and or design an appropriate implant which can include appropriate combinations of acetabular shells liners of varying materials including plastics and polymers such as polyethylene ceramics metals or composites femoral head size diameter and shape neck length thickness shape length size and angle i.e. anteverted neck a straight neck or a retroverted neck and femoral stem axis length thickness width shape curvature variation and or angulation or a single or multi piece implant can be designed selected and or manufactured.

The femoral stem may be chosen in a conventional manner such that the representation of the stem on a dimensional template substantially fills the intramedullary canal of the femoral shaft of the generated image data such that the actual femoral stem component of the hip implant will correctly fit the intramedullary canal of the actual femur. If desired a non uniform stem and or non cylindrical and or other support anchoring structure can be designed and or selected based upon the generated image data. Provision is thus made for cross sections of the stem shaft to be rectangular or trapezoidal with pronounced longitudinal edges which can establish contact with the cortex to improve anchoring and long term implant performance. Provision could also be made for an arcuate shape of the stem base body to be selected in particular with respect to curvature and length in relation to two oppositely disposed edges i.e. a lateral edge and a medial edge such that an end position or other portion of the stem base body has a plurality of contact positions to the cortex or other cortical bone within the femoral canal i.e. three or more contact positions along the stem body . In this manner the curvature of the base body and the length of the base body and or of the shaft could be particularly matched pre operatively to one another and the surrounding anatomy.

The various features of the revision implant need not necessarily match those of the primary implant or even those of the original femur femoral head or acetabular cup. For example the revision femoral head location of center may not necessarily coincide with the original center of femoral head prior to revision surgery because the condition of the revision femoral head or other portions of the joint may dictate a different center for the head of the revision implant component. For example if the original femoral head is severely deteriorated or is badly misshapen the surgeon may desire a different center for the head of the revision implant than the current center for the original femoral head. Also the surgeon may wish to correct some problem e.g. laxity correction or bone alignment correction which may cause the center for the head of the revision implant to be different than the center of femoral head. The pre operative planning and evaluation phase permits the surgeon to obtain the preoperatively planned values for the offset and the leg length for the modular or patient designed components including the neck component of the hip implant.

During various embodiments of the surgical planning phase the surgeon or implant tool designer or automatic program chooses a desired anteversion component from various planes of reference points and or other image data. The representation of the femoral stem may be oriented relative to the image data to align with the intramedullary canal of the image of the femoral shaft. The surgeon may then use various planes of reference points to determine a desired anteversion component for the modular neck of the hip implant. In one exemplary procedure the surgeon can determine the anteversion component first and then determine the necessary leg length and offset values for the preoperative plan of the procedure. Additional planning steps can include deciding where the center of the head of the neck should be located and or what anteversion component is necessary as well as selecting designing a neck corresponding to the assessed variables of leg length offset and anteversion. Desirably the system will simplify the surgeon s ability to determine the optimal position of the center of the head of the neck . In various embodiments the system may utilize both NP and lateral views simultaneously or may utilize a three dimensional data image with the chose designed implants superimposed thereon to allow the surgeon designer to simultaneously assess all three variables i.e. anteversion leg length and offset.

Similar patient specific and anatomy specific designs can be selected manufactured using the generated image data. For example areas of particular weakness i.e. thin bone sections or areas of limited cortical bone can be accounted for in the design selection of implant components. Alternatively areas of greater strength and or bone concentration i.e. a thicker than expected pelvic bone capable of accommodating a larger than normal acetabular cup can lead to differences in selection and or design of the various implant components. In addition unique anatomy i.e. a pelvic bone that will require an acetabular cup of unusual or non spherical outer surface characteristics can be accounted for pre operatively in the implant design. Similarly surgical tools and jigs can be designed that match or otherwise conform to 1 anatomical structures only 2 failed implant structures only and or combinations thereof. These surgical tools can assist with alignment and placement of cutting drill instruments to prepare the anatomical support structures i.e. femur and or pelvis for implantation of revision implants. The tools jigs can also be used to align and or guide tools to assist in separating the failed implant components i.e. failed acetabular cup and or femoral stems or other components and or adhesive materials i.e. bone cement and or osteo integrated surfaces from the underlying anatomical support structures.

If desired the surgical jigs and tools described herein and the implants selected designed as well can be used to perform hemi arthroplasty as well as facilitate total hip joint replacement. Such procedures could include the use of surgical tools and or jigs that utilize alignment surfaces from only half of a joint i.e. the femoral side of a hip joint to align tools and implant components for use on the other side of the joint i.e. the pelvis . Such alignment surfaces could match or otherwise substantially conform to anatomical and or implant structures as previously described. In other embodiments the surgical tools and or jigs could utilize alignment surfaces from the same half of a joint as treated implanted. In other alternative embodiments the surgical tools and or jigs could utilize alignment surfaces from both halves of the joint to align tools and implant components for use on one half and or both sides of the joint.

Once the failed implant has been removed or while the failed implant is still attached to the joint if the relevant anatomy is accessible one or more surgical tools can be introduced along the designated alignment guides to prepare the joint for implantation of the revision implant. If desired some preparation steps may be performed before removal of the failed implant and some afterwards. In addition it is contemplated that preparation of various anatomical surfaces will allow placement of subsequent alignment tools using the newly prepared surface s for guiding further surgical tools.

Once the underlying anatomical support structure has been prepared and any augments deemed necessary have been positioned and or secured to the support structure and or to the implant surface s if necessary the revision implant may be placed into the joint and the surgery completed. If desired the surgical procedure may involve replacement of only a single component or components with other components remaining intact in the joint. For example where an acetabular cup and or femoral head has significantly degraded but the femoral stem is well secured the femoral stem may be allowed to remain in place with the femoral head removed if modular or otherwise removable in some manner and replaced and or the acetabular cup replaced. Tools for use with such procedures could include jigs having combinations of patient specific anatomic surfaces and or implant specific anatomical surfaces to assist in alignment and or preparation of the underlying anatomical surfaces.

Aside from facilitating the creation selection of implants particularized for a specific patient and or surgical procedure and selecting designing jigs for that procedure that utilize combinations of anatomy implant features for alignment the various embodiments described herein reduce and or eliminate the need for a surgeon to trial or otherwise test the size and or suitability of the implants and implant components in the targeted joint. The use of patient specific implants in combination with tools that utilize patient and implant specific alignment surfaces greatly reduces and or eliminates the uncertainly associated with the implantation of joint implants including revision implants.

Although described throughout with respect to a hip implant the method could be utilized in any procedure which uses modular components for example but not limited to shoulder implant procedures knee implant procedures etc.

In a healthy shoulder the proximal humerus is generally ball shaped and articulates within a socket formed by the scapula called the glenoid to form the shoulder joint. Conventional implant systems for the total replacement of the shoulder joint due to disease or trauma i.e. a total shoulder arthroplasty generally replicate the natural anatomy of the shoulder and typically include a humeral component having a stem which fits within the humeral canal and an articulating head which articulates within the socket of a glenoid component implanted within the glenoid of the scapula. An implant system for the replacement of only the humeral component of the shoulder joint i.e. a hemi shoulder arthroplasty typically includes only a humeral component which articulates within the natural glenoid socket of the scapula.

More recently reverse type implant systems have been developed in which the conventional ball and socket configuration that replicates the natural anatomy of the shoulder is reversed such that a concave recessed articulating component is provided at the proximal end of the humeral component that articulates against a convex portion of the glenoid component. Such reverse shoulder implant systems are thought to provide an increased range of motion for treatment of glenohumeral arthritis associated with irreparable rotator cuff damage for example by moving the center of rotation between the humeral component and the glenoid component to allow the deltoid muscles to exert a greater lever arm on the humerus.

Various embodiments of this disclosure are particularly well suited for treating and or replacing failed or failing shoulder implants as well as for converting reverse type implant systems to normal shoulder systems and vica versa. By utilizing generated image data the current condition of the failed failing implant and the surrounding anatomical support structure can be determined with significant accuracy and an appropriate revision implant or implant components can be selected and or designed for the patient s needs. In addition the creation of surgical tool and or jigs that match or otherwise conform to 1 anatomical structures only 2 failed implant structures only and or any combinations thereof significantly facilitate the alignment and placement of cutting drill instruments to prepare the anatomical support structures i.e. glenoid and or humerus for implantation of revision implants. The tools jigs can also be used to align and or guide tools to assist in separating the failed implant components i.e. failed glenoid cup or other components and or humeral stems or other components and or adhesive materials i.e. bone cement and or osteo integrated surfaces from the underlying anatomical support structures.

In general standard implant systems for total shoulder arthroplasties and hemi shoulder arthroplasties including a humeral stem having an enlarged head portion with interfaces adapted to removably receive various modular interchangeable components such as articulating liners spacers and adapter inserts. The humeral stem typically functions as a universal platform that may be used in either conventional or reverse total shoulder arthroplasties as well as hemi shoulder arthroplasties and may remain implanted in place during a revision in which the implant system is converted between the foregoing configurations. Where failure of the implant is not attributable to failure of the humeral stem it is desirable to retain the stem as removal and replacement of the stem can often be a difficult procedure. An articulating liner on the stem generally articulates against a glenoid component and may be angled to change the neck angle of the humeral stem from an angle suited for a conventional total arthroplasty or a hemi arthroplasty to an angle suited for a reverse total arthroplasty. The spacer may optionally be used to fit between the humeral stem and the articulating liner to provide increased joint tension when needed. An adapter insert can be used to provide an interface with a convex articulating component in a hemi arthroplasty application. A glenoid component is also typically provided that is mountable to the glenoid by a plurality of polyaxial locking screws or other devices or adhesives and which receives a glenosphere having a smooth convex and uninterrupted articulating surface against which the articulating liner of the humeral component may articulate.

In many occasions failure of a primary shoulder joint implant occurs as a result of displacement or rotation of the glenoid component especially where the anatomical supporting structures of the glenoid scapula have further degraded since the initial surgery if the initial glenoid component was oversized or otherwise suitable for the patient s anatomy where the patient has failed to allow sufficient time for the components to integrate or secure to the underlying structure and or where trauma has occurred. Regardless of the underlying reason s for implant failure however the various embodiments of this disclosure can be used for facilitate treatment of a wide variety of joints including revisions of shoulder joint implants. This disclosure can assist a surgeon in designing a revision implant for a failed shoulder joint as well as be used to assist the surgeon in selecting pre manufactured implants and or modular implant components including stem and cup components for revision shoulder implants. Desirably the steps described herein can help a surgeon properly plan the revision surgery and reduce or eliminate a need to change a preoperatively chosen implant or modular component.

Once a set of generated data as previously described is constructed using various image sources including typical images for a shoulder replacement procedure which can be taken along different directions and appropriate image processing and evaluation steps including the use of prior patient images if available the information may utilized to design a patient specific implant or implant components and or to select an implant and or modular components. The present method allows the surgeon to quickly and easily select design implant components based on an evaluation of many variables without requiring reevaluation of the other variables of the joint. The method can further include preoperative planning of the surgical procedure which advantageously provides an intuitive system for the surgeon both preoperatively and during surgery.

A computer system with optional user input including various criteria entered by a surgeon and or implant designer manufacturer may be used to design choose an appropriate revision implant based on anatomical constraints or a template or other implant information may be used in conjunction with the generated image s to design choose the implant and or to preoperatively plan the surgical joint revision procedure. In various embodiments the image of the failed implant may be subtracted allowing the template to be utilized directly with the generated image. In other embodiments the failed implant may remain on the image. If desired the failed implant may be identified by a color code or shading that differentiates it from the remaining anatomy. Similarly anatomical areas may be shaded color coded or otherwise identified to reflect an anticipated confidence of the accuracy of the individual anatomical features of the generated image. For example the estimated anatomical margins of the humeral canal or the margins of the glenoid bone may be shown on the image as contour lines or differing shapes or colors corresponding to confidences of 100 99 95 90 85 and so on. A surgeon can use this information to design choose an implant sized to fit within an anticipate confidence region or regions as desired by the surgeon or user. In a similar manner the use can utilize the contour lines to estimate the chances of each of a given set of implants to fit the anatomy of the generated image.

The template may be constructed of a piece of transparent plastic or other suitable material which may be overlaid on the image of the shoulder of the patient or may be an electronic image or data set that is virtually overlaid or otherwise manipulated relative to the generated image data. The template data set may include a plurality of reference points forming a grid coordinate system for example a Cartesian coordinate system including a pattern of intersecting horizontal and vertical indicators or lines that provide coordinates for locating points. A plurality or system of templates may be provided corresponding to each available size or type of shoulder implant and or implant component of a given shoulder implant system or systems.

Using generated image date of the patient s anatomical structure optionally with the failed implant components subtracted from the image the data can be utilized to select appropriate implant components and or design an appropriate implant which can include appropriate combinations of glenoid cups humeral components i.e. stems of differing length thickness shape length size and angle heads of different size diameter and shape liners of varying materials including plastics and polymers such as polyethylene ceramics metals or composites etc. and or sleeves or spacers etc. or a single or multi piece implant can be designed selected and or manufactured.

The various features of the revision implant need not necessarily match those of the primary implant. For example the revision shoulder components could be a reverse shoulder where the original failed should was a standard implant set. As another alternative the revision glenoid cup may include one or more additional anchoring components including a glenoid or scapular stem that extends from the glenoid fossa into the scapula. If desired the generated image data can be utilized to design a glenoid cup component having an attached or attachable stem that follows a medullary canal of the scapula which would permit replacement of a failed glenoid cup even where significant damage to the glenoid bone obviates replacement with a standard cup.

As with other joint designs the revision shoulder system need not be of the same design from the patient s original anatomy although it could be designed the same if desired possibly because the condition of the revision humeral head or other portions of the joint may dictate a different center for the head of the revision implant component. For example if the original humeral head is severely deteriorated or is badly misshapen the surgeon may desire a different center for the head of the revision implant than the current center for the original humeral head. Also the surgeon may wish to correct some problem e.g. laxity correction or bone alignment correction which may cause the center for the head of the revision implant to be different than the center of humeral head. The pre operative planning and evaluation phase permits the surgeon to obtain the preoperatively planned values for the offset and the leg length for the modular or patient designed components including the neck component of the shoulder implant.

In various embodiments patient specific and anatomy specific designs for implants and or tools can be selected manufactured using the generated image data. For example areas of particular weakness i.e. thin bone sections or areas of limited cortical bone can be accounted for in the design selection of implant components. Alternatively areas of greater strength and or bone concentration i.e. a thicker than expected scapular bone capable of accommodating a larger than normal glenoid cup can lead to differences in selection and or design of the various implant components. In addition unique anatomy i.e. a scapular bone that will require an glenoid cup of unusual or non spherical outer surface characteristics or one that requires additional support from a scapular stem can be accounted for pre operatively in the implant design. Similarly surgical tools and jigs can be designed that match or otherwise conform to 1 anatomical structures only 2 failed implant structures only and or combinations thereof. These surgical tools can assist with alignment and placement of cutting drill instruments to prepare the anatomical support structures i.e. humerus and or scapula glenoid for implantation of revision implants. The tools jigs can also be used to align and or guide tools to assist in separating the failed implant components i.e. failed glenoid cup and or humeral stems or other components and or adhesive materials i.e. bone cement and or osteo integrated surfaces from the underlying anatomical support structures.

If desired the surgical jigs and tools described herein and the implants selected designed as well can be used to perform hemi arthroplasty as well as facilitate total shoulder joint replacement. Such procedures could include the use of surgical tools and or jigs that utilize alignment surfaces from only half of a joint i.e. the humeral side of a hip joint to align tools and implant components for use on the other side of the joint i.e. the scapula glenoid . Such alignment surfaces could match or otherwise substantially conform to anatomical and or implant structures as previously described. In other embodiments the surgical tools and or jigs could utilize alignment surfaces from the same half of a joint as treated implanted. In other alternative embodiments the surgical tools and or jigs could utilize alignment surfaces from both halves of the joint to align tools and implant components for use on one half and or both sides of the joint.

Once the failed implant has been removed or while the failed implant is still attached to the joint if the relevant anatomy is accessible one or more surgical tools can be introduced along the designated alignment guides to prepare the joint for implantation of the revision implant. If desired some preparation steps may be performed before removal of the failed implant and some afterwards. In addition it is contemplated that preparation of various anatomical surfaces will allow placement of subsequent alignment tools using the newly prepared surface s for guiding further surgical tools.

Once the underlying anatomical support structure has been prepared and any augments deemed necessary have been positioned and or secured to the support structure and or to the implant surface s if necessary the revision implant may be placed into the joint and the surgery completed. If desired the surgical procedure may involve replacement of only a single component or components with other components remaining intact in the joint. For example where an glenoid cup and or humeral head has significantly degraded but the humeral stem is well secured the humeral stem may be allowed to remain in place with the humeral head removed if modular or otherwise removable in some manner and replaced and or the glenoid cup replaced. Tools for use with such procedures could include jigs having combinations of patient specific anatomic surfaces and or implant specific anatomical surfaces to assist in alignment and or preparation of the underlying anatomical surfaces.

Aside from facilitating the creation selection of implants particularized for a specific patient and or surgical procedure and selecting designing jigs for that procedure that utilize combinations of anatomy implant features for alignment the various embodiments described herein reduce and or eliminate the need for a surgeon to trial or otherwise test the size and or suitability of the implants and implant components in the targeted joint. The use of patient specific implants in combination with tools that utilize patient and implant specific alignment surfaces greatly reduces and or eliminates the uncertainly associated with the implantation of joint implants including revision implants.

The various embodiments of this disclosure disclosed herein can significantly reduce the complexity and or significantly improve the outcome of a surgical procedure for revising a failed or failing joint implant. In the current practice an example of which is described in the Zimmer Nexgen LOCK TKA Surgical Technique Guide commercially available from Zimmer Inc. the access and immediate removal of a failed or failing joint implant is generally the initial step in a revision surgical procedure. Once implant removal has been accomplished a surgeon is required to utilize a number of surgical tools and alignment guides and generally prepare and implant one or more anchoring measurement devices i.e. intramedullary stems etc. in an initial effort to align and position various tools for guiding the subsequent surgical cuts and or drill holes made into the anatomical support structure. In the case of preparing a tibia for a Nexgen revision implant the surgeon is initially directed to remove the failed implant and then must drill ream into the tibial canal and place a provisional tibial stem or reamer within the canal. Numerous tools and or alignment guides are then attached to the stem reamer including external alignment rods cutting jigs and or alignment sizing plates in an effort to create a desired anatomical support surface and choose the proper size shape components to fit the created support surface. The Nexgen technique guide identifies over nine separate tools and attachments necessary to align and guide the cutting tools for preparing just the tibial surface and canal.

In contrast various embodiments of this disclosure can accomplish the same alignment and surface preparation for the tibia utilizing a bare handful of tools. In one embodiment an alignment jig can be created having an inner surface that matches and or substantially conforms to some or all of the existing failed implant and or the surrounding tibial bone surfaces if desired . This jig can include a pair of openings on a lateral side to accommodate a plurality of alignment pins. The jig can further incorporate one or more slots or cutting guides if desired to facilitate the accurate and safe cutting of the tibial surface with the failed implant still in position in the joint if desired . Alternatively the jig can be removed after placement of the markers and or the jig can dock with the failed implant and assist with implant removal. Once the jig and failed implant have been removed a second jig or the same jig initially used but without any attached failed implant can be positioned over the alignment pins and drill guides and or cutting slots on the jig can be accessed to prepare the tibial bone for the revision implant. Additional openings in the jig can accommodate additional surgical tools if necessary including saw blades for planar cuts as well as reamer and or drill openings for placement of anchoring structures and or support pins. The tibial surface is then prepared and ready for implantation.

The use of assessment and planning software in combination with creation of jigs having anatomic specific and or implant specific conforming features allows the surgery to be planned pre operatively allows the implant to be designed and or selected to match the anticipated support structure for the revision implant and allows the creation of jigs to be properly aligned without requiring the surgeon to resort to aligning the implant off an intramedullary canal or other anatomical features remote or unaffected by the joint implant failure or joint deterioration. In addition the present embodiments significantly reduce the need for the surgeon to measure evaluate and calculate alignment planes cutting planes and reaming drilling depths in a free hand or gut feel manner which can lead to significant mistakes and or unintended consequences for the patient.

If desired in addition to the tools and implants described herein various additional embodiments contemplate the creation of a backup or rescue revision implant system and tools. It is possible but highly unlikely that the various embodiments described herein would recommend the creation of an implant and or surgical tools that would not properly engage or substantially conform to the failed implant and or the underlying anatomical structure of the failed joint. In such a case a set of surgical tools can be created to accommodate a wide variety of variation in the implant surface and or anatomical structure surface yet provide sufficient alignment information to permit the surgical creation of a desired anatomical support structure and implantation of a replacement implant. In such cases it may be desirable that the tools and or implant include one or more anatomical reliefs to accommodate variations in the underlying structure s . For example a jig could be designed and constructed with a relative large internal cavity that accommodates a wide variety of implant shapes and sizes but that includes one or more features that contact and or otherwise interact with accessible known surfaces on the patient s bone and or failed implant. Such features could include edges that conform to the outer cortical wall of the tibial tuberosity and or the tibal neck with additional features that contact the upper surface of the failed tibial tray implant. Such a design could potentially accommodate a variety of tray perimeter sizes and or thickness while providing sufficient alignment and positioning information to prepare the tibial surface for implant placement. In various alternate embodiments the tools and or implant could incorporate one or more inserts that comprise a surface that matches or substantially conforms to an estimates anatomical or implant surface but that can be removed if desired to reveal a different surface and or anatomical relief surface for accommodating the unexpected anatomy implant features.

In various embodiments the one or more jigs incorporating patient specific and or failed implant specific conforming features desirably provide known reference point s and or reference plane s for use by the surgeon during the surgical procedure. For example the jigs may conform to and interact with reference features of the failed implant which are in a known relationship through the image assessment and evaluation process to one or more anatomical axis of the joint and or limb. Placement of the jig onto the failed implant or some portion thereof and subsequent placement of alignment markers through known jig alignment points or relative to known alignment from the jib and into the bone or relative to some other surface allows the failed implant and or jig to subsequently be removed while retaining known alignment position s relative to the joint. Subsequent tools can utilize the alignment markers in a known manner to align surgical cutting tools and create a desired anatomical support structure for the revision implant.

In a similar manner other embodiments of jigs may utilize various combinations of failed implant surfaces and or anatomical surfaces or combinations thereof to align jig components. Such tools could include implant only alignment implant and anatomical structure alignment and or anatomical structure only alignment. Such tools could also include various combinations of failed implant anatomical alignment structures that also permit jig alignment using anatomy only such as where the failed implant has been removed and or alignment of the failed implant is uncertain i.e. the implant shifts or rotates relatively freely or where it has been displaced or otherwise moved in an undesirable manner at some point during the surgical procedure .

Alternative embodiments of jigs may be utilized directly in contact with a failed implant with the failed implant still attached and or in position within the joint and the jig could incorporate alignment guides that allow cutting or other preparation of the bone via unobstructed access around and or through the failed implant. For example one exemplary jig could include an inner surface that conforms in some manner to a failed tibial tray implant additional alignment features could include the anterior cortex or other anatomical structures including residual bone information as well as information on osteophytes and or osteolysis . The jig could include a saw cut alignment guide adjacent to the anterior portion of the tibial head yet positioned below the lower margin of the tibial tray i.e. a set distance or height below the tibial plateau or other tibial surface . One or more cutting saws could be introduced through the alignment guide and cut portions of a planar tibial surface with the failed implant still in position. If desired the alignment guide could incorporate cut outs or other such barriers which may be modular and or removable at the user s option to prevent the saw blades from encountering undesirable obstructions or other anatomical areas such as an intramedullary rod or tibial tray anchor extending down into the tibial bone from the failed tibial tray. Once sufficient surgical cutting has been accomplished the jig may be removed and then the implant may be removed or they may be removed concurrently . Such steps may simplify the removal of failed implant components and could significantly reduce the potential for additional anatomical damage caused when the implant and or support structure i.e. anchors cement bone ingrowth surfaces etc. is removed possibly breaking additional anatomical structures off the bone .

Various embodiments of this disclosure contemplate the use of the generated image information to account for and or accommodate defects and or other undesirable anatomical features. For example the generated image information can be utilized to determine areas of defects and or osteolysis as well as areas that may have degraded in some other fashion or have anatomical structures that are desirably removed i.e. osteophytes etc. prior to implantation of a revision prosthesis. If desired the surgical tools and or revision implant can be selected and or designed to have protrusions voids or other such features that accommodate or otherwise fill or partially fill the defects and or removed structures. Other embodiments can include the use of generated image information to select wedges spacer blocks and or other structures for use with the surgical tools and or revision implant. These embodiments contemplate the use of surgical tools that account for the use of such structures including the use of spacers or other structures that modularly snap in or connect or secure to the tool on other such fashion and may optionally be removable. Various modular pieces may include surfaces that conform to underlying anatomical or implant structures such that they can be inserted and or removed as needed during the surgical procedure to replicate the underlying surface s with which they interact.

If desired the various embodiments described herein can be utilized in conjunction with standard implants and or surgical tools including partial joint replacement resurfacing systems and or standard total joint or partial joint revision implant systems. As previously noted the present systems can replace multiple tool sets used in standard systems to identify anatomical landmarks guide cutting and drilling reaming tools and assist with removal of failed implant components as well as preparation of the anatomical support system for a replacement implant. If desired various embodiments of this disclosure may also be used to assist with balancing of soft tissues and articulating surfaces.

One example of a jig to assist in preparation and or placement of a standard revision implant system could include a patient specific upper surface that substantially conforms to or otherwise references anatomical or other structures of the patient s femoral surfaces i.e. anterior cortex resected bone bony defects osteolysis resected femoral surfaces and or residual cement surfaces still integrated with the bone . An access or guide path is provided through the jig for a reamer drill or other cutting instrument. Desirably this guide path has been designed in conjunction with generated image data to follow a desired trajectory relative to an anatomical mechanical or other axis determined from the image data. In various embodiments the guide path is designed to avoid contact with the cortical wall of the canal although other embodiments may seek such to abut or otherwise contact the cortical walls for potentially added anchoring strength or other objective. The guide path may be linear cylindrical tortuous or any combination thereof.

A surgical cutting tool such as a drill or reamer may be introduced down the guide path and create a canal channel for accommodating a femoral stem or other anchoring device. The channel may be formed into virtually any shape but will desirably be aligned by the guide path and generally follow the contour of the channel. If desired the channel may be curved or follow other shapes i.e. may accommodate variations in the canal wall shape etc. with the stem or other anchor designed in a similar shape to fit or otherwise be accommodated by the channel.

If desired the surgical tool kit and implant system can include optional components or features that facilitate the surgeon s implant s ability to accommodate unexpected anatomy and or correct surgical mistakes or other undesirable events occurring during the surgical procedure. For example the generated image data may indicate that sufficient natural anatomy remains after removal of the failed implant to support a revision implant without need for a femoral stem or other auxiliary support structure but during the surgical procedure it becomes apparent that insufficient support structure remains. Similarly anatomical support material that was intended to be used to support the revision implant may adhere to the failed implant and or break off from the bone during implant removal or anatomical surface cutting and preparation.

In one embodiment a tibial jig could include an optional plug or other feature that when removed reveals a guide path formed in the jig to accommodate a tibial canal cutting tool i.e. drill or reamer for creating a channel within the tibial medullary canal for placement of a tibial stem or other auxiliary anchoring device. A tibial stem or other anchoring device could be included as part of the revision implant kit to be utilized if necessary. In a similar fashion the revision tibial tray could include optional connection devices for securing to the tibial stem or other anchoring device or an alternate tibial tray suitable for use with the anchoring device could be provided as well. If desired blocks wedges and or other spacers may be provided as well.

Similar auxiliary anchoring devices could be provided for use with other joints or other joint portions including the femoral side of the knee joint.

An Implant Reference Surgical Tool e.g. an IJig tool can rest on an existing implant or implants such as for example in a knee replacement on the tibial plateau or femoral condyle in order to place a new revision implant precisely on the tibial plateau or the femoral condyle.

In a conventional revision surgery once the existing implant is removed there is no clear useable references on the implantation site from which to generate a new revision implant and related IJig tools to place the new revision implant.

In one aspect of this disclosure original electronically maintained files of the existing implant e.g. an IUni implant system for a patient if available can be used as a reference for the placement of a new revision implant e.g. an IUni implant system IDuo implant system or ITotal implant system . Further to adjust for any placement issues during the original surgery the electronic files can be compared to new image data obtained from the patient. Adjustments can be made to relocate the electronic implant such that it matches the location of the implant in accordance with the new image data. In one embodiment the electronic files can be saved in a new location for making new reference files of the original implant that is now failing or otherwise in need of revision.

The original implant reference files e.g. original electronic files used for making the original implant that is now failing and in need of revision along with the patient s information e.g. information about various surfaces of the patient s joint and or the existing implant from the new image data can now be used to determine the placement of a new implant. Accordingly new surgical tools e.g. IJig tools can be designed and made according to the desired placement of the new implant.

In certain embodiments during the revision surgery the existing implant in the patient will not be removed until at least one implant reference surgical tool have presented at least one cutting or drilling location.
