It can be seen from the foregoing technical solutions according to the embodiments of the present invention that the automatic mounting of the NAS device is realized by discovering and parsing the configuration information of the NAS device in the network and personally recorded video contents or downloaded media contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded media contents are stored in the NAS device can be played according to the selection of a user in the case that local data storage is not supported so as to enable a digital home user to obtain a better user experience.

The technical solutions according to the embodiments of the present invention are clearly and completely described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Obviously the embodiments to be described are only part of rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.

An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for mounting a network attached storage NAS device where the method includes broadcasting by a digital media player DMP in a network a discovery message for searching a network attached storage NAS device parsing by the DMP a configuration response message sent by the NAS device according to the discovery message and obtaining configuration information of the NAS device and mounting by the DMP the NAS device according to the configuration information. By using the method an existing DMP that does not support file storage automatically mounts the NAS device through a network file system so as to realize personal video recording or download application in an IPTV. In this embodiment the corresponding NAS device may be a storage device that exists in the network and is used by other devices and generally provides a standard network file service for example samba NFS and so on . The corresponding DMP device may be a device that is connected to a home gateway and provides media content sharing to a home network and in this embodiment a STB that does not support a PVR is used as the DMP device for description. The embodiment is specifically described below with reference to an accompanying drawing in the specification. As shown in the method may include 

Step A DMP broadcasts in a network a discovery message for searching a network attached storage NAS device.

Specifically as shown in when an STB that does not support a PVR and is used as a DMP is powered on for connecting to a network a NAS device in the network is actively searched at first by performing step S. The searching method may be broadcasting a discovery message in the network a format of the discovery message is as shown in the following table 

Identification Code A in the message is an identification of the message which indicates that the message is a discovery message and is sent by the STB IP indicates an IP address of the STB that sends the message SN indicates a serial number of the STB that sends the message and Checksum indicates a HASH value of all information excluding a header field and before this field and is used to prevent forging of the message.

Step The DMP parses a configuration response message sent by the NAS device according to the discovery message and obtains configuration information of the NAS device.

Specifically after receiving the discovery message by an online NAS device as shown in the online NAS device returns a configuration response message to the STB that sends the discovery message by performing step S the configuration response message may be a message sent to a 54330 port of the STB through UDP unicast and a format of the configuration response message is as shown in the following table 

Identification Code C in the message is an identification of the message which indicates that the message is a response message and is sent by the NAS SN indicates a serial number of the NAS device that sends the message Checksum indicates a HASH value of all information excluding a header field before this field and is used to prevent forging of the message Para Code1 represents a following parameter name for example a URL for mounting and a URL for configuring NAS Para Len indicates a length of the parameter and Para Value indicates a value of the parameter which is transferred by means of ASCII codes.

After receiving the configuration response message sent by the NAS device as shown in the STB parses the configuration response message by performing step S and obtains configuration information of the NAS device the configuration information carries the serial number of the NAS device a URL address for mounting and a URL address for configuring.

Specifically after obtaining the configuration information as shown in the STB mounts the NAS device by performing step S. Taking an example that a mounting manner is a NFS The NAS device returns a URL address for mounting which is similar to NFS where if a default value of port is 2049 the value of port may not be carried when mounting the NAS device the STB needs to attach the serial number of the NAS at the back of the URL and the corresponding serial number must be completely consistent with that filled in during broadcasting. Therefore a complete URL address after mounting is NFS .

After the mounting is completed the STB continues to configure the NAS device through a URL address because the NAS device returns the URL address for configuring that is similar to http where if a default value of port is 80 the value of the port may not be carried and the parameter is used to open personally recorded video contents or downloaded contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded contents are shared on the NAS device through browser jump when a user inputs a command configure NAS device in a configuration page.

An embodiment of the present invention further provides another method for mounting a NAS device as shown in where the method includes 

Step A DMP monitors whether a broadcast message sent by a network attached storage NAS device exists in a network and sends a response message to the NAS device if the broadcast message sent by the NAS device in the network is received.

Specifically in this embodiment the corresponding NAS device may be a storage device which exists in the network and is used by other devices and generally provides a standard network file service for example samba NFS and so on . The corresponding DMP device may be a device that is connected to a home gateway and provides media content sharing to a home network and in this embodiment a STB that does not support a PVR is used as the DMP device for description.

As shown in if the STB which is used as a DMP and does not support the PVR does not find an online NAS device after being powered on and connected to a network the STB keeps monitoring a network state. When a NAS device is online in the network a message is broadcasted in the network by performing step Q where a format of the broadcast message is as shown in the following table 

Identification Code B in the message is an identification of the message which indicates that the message is a broadcast message and is sent by the NAS device IP indicates an IP address of the NAS device that sends the message SN indicates a serial number of the NAS device that sends the message and Checksum indicates a HASH value of all information excluding a header field before the header field and is used to prevent forging of the message.

After receiving the broadcast message as shown in the STB sends a discovery response message to the NAS device that sends the broadcast message through step Q where a format of the discovery response message is the same as that of a broadcasted discovery message for actively searching the NAS device in the network.

Step The DMP parses a configuration response message sent by the NAS device according to the discovery message and obtains configuration information of the NAS device.

Specifically after receiving the response message sent by the STB as shown in the NAS device returns a configuration response message to the STB that sends the discovery message by performing step Q where the configuration response message may be a message sent to a 54330 port of the STB through UDP unicast and a format of the configuration response message is as shown in the following table 

Identification Code C in the message is an identification of the message which indicates that the message is a response message and is sent by the NAS SN indicates the serial number of the NAS device that sends the message Checksum indicates the HASH value of all the information excluding a header before this field and is used to prevent forging of the message Para Code1 represents a following parameter name for example a URL for mounting a URL for configuring by the NAS Para Len indicates a length of the parameter and Para Value indicates a value of the parameter which is transferred by means of ASCII codes.

After receiving the configuration response message sent by the NAS device as shown in the STB parses the configuration response message by performing step Q and obtains configuration information of the NAS device where the configuration information carries the serial number of the NAS device a URL for mounting a URL for configuring by the NAS.

Specifically after obtaining the configuration information as shown in the STB mounts the NAS device by performing step Q. Taking an example that a mounting manner is NFS The NAS device returns a URL address for mounting that is similar to NFS where if a default value of port is 2049 the value of the port may not be carried when mounting the NAS device the STB needs to attach the serial number of the NAS at the back of the URL and the corresponding serial number must be completely consistent with that filled in during broadcasting. Therefore a complete URL address after mounting is NFS .

After the mounting is completed the STB continues to configure the NAS device through a URL address because the NAS device returns the URL address for configuring that is similar to http where if a default value of port is 80 the value of the port may not be carried and the parameter is used to open personally recorded video contents or downloaded contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded contents are shared on the NAS device through browser jump when a user inputs a command configure NAS device in a configuration page.

After the STB that does not support the PVR completes the mounting of the NAS device reading of data such as images audios and videos that are stored in the NAS device can be realized. is a schematic flow chart about controlling a STB to browse and play contents on a NAS device by a remote controller so as to realize the sharing of personally recorded video contents in the IPTV by the NAS device . First when the STB plays a recorded program in the NAS device the STB as defined by the DLNA provides a UI interface for a user to browse contents. After receiving a remote controller event from the user the UI invokes an API Application Programming Interface application programming interface provided by the STB triggers the STB to retrieve a content directory in the NAS device for browsing or playing. In in a corresponding scenario the NAS device is a DMS device which provides UPnP sharing of recorded contents to the STB after the STB and the NAS device are mutually discovered through UPnP a file list is displayed on the UI of the STB by content directory browse and when playing is started connection is established between the STB and the NAS device by connection management and playing is controlled by audio and video transmission management so that out of band not limited by the DLNA transmission of the personally recorded video contents is performed through a transmission manner of connection management negotiation.

In a specific application scenario for example a personal video recorded content sharing system based on a NAS device shown in a corresponding module for mounting the NAS device is set in a STB . By setting a storage address to be the corresponding NAS device address even if the STB does not have a local storage function a personal video recording or download service can also be provided to a user. A corresponding module for playing the media content is set in a STB or a PC which has the functions of discovering a device in a system and playing content. During playing the media content a subject for triggering the obtaining of IPTV contents is still the STB however the STB does not need a local hard disk any longer but mounts the NAS device through NFS or samba and writes the corresponding media content in the NAS device. When an interconnection solution of devices in the system is a solution defined by the DLNA other devices such as the STB or the PC may access personally recorded video contents or downloaded contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded contents are stored in the NAS device.

By using the technical solution according to this embodiment the automatic mounting of the NAS device is realized by discovering and parsing the configuration information of the NAS device in the network and the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded media contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded contents are stored in the NAS device can be played according to the selection of a user in the case that local data storage is not supported so as to enable a digital home user to obtain a better user experience.

An embodiment of the present invention further provides a digital media player as shown in where the digital media player may specifically include a device searching unit a first message parsing unit and a first device mounting unit . The device searching unit is configured to broadcast in a network a discovery message for searing a NAS device the first message parsing unit is configured to parse a configuration response message sent by the NAS device according to the discovery message and obtain configuration information of the NAS device and the first device mounting unit is configured to mount the NAS device according to the configuration information.

Optionally in the device searching unit the discovery message carries an IP address of the DMP a serial number of the DMP and an identification of the discovery message.

Optionally in the first message parsing unit the configuration information carries a serial number used to identify and mount the NAS device a URL address for mounting and a URL address for configuring.

By using the technical solution according to this embodiment the automatic mounting of the NAS device is realized by discovering and parsing the configuration information of the NAS device in the network and personally recorded video contents or downloaded media contents where the personally recorded video contents or the downloaded media contents are stored in the NAS device can be played according to the selection of a user in the case that local data storage is not supported so as to enable a digital home user to obtain a better user experience.
