This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 812 384 which is a 35 U.S.C. 371 national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT US2009 030603 filed Jan. 9 2009 and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 020 125 that was filed on Jan. 9 2008 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention relates to novel inhibitors of serine threonine protein kinases e.g. Akt and related kinases pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors methods for preparing these inhibitors and their use as therapeutics. The inhibitors are useful for example for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer and inflammation in mammals.

Protein kinases PK are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal gamma phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways these enzymes modulate cell growth differentiation and proliferation i.e. virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity Hardie G. and Hanks S. 1995 Academic Press San Diego Calif. . Furthermore abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders ranging from relatively non life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma brain cancer . Protein kinases are an important target class for therapeutic modulation Cohen P. 2002 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 1 309 .

Protein kinases include two classes protein tyrosine kinases PTK and serine threonine kinases STK . The Protein Kinase B Akt enzymes are a group of serine threonine kinases that are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. One of the best characterized targets of the PI3K lipid products is the 57 KD serine threonine protein kinase Akt downstream of PI3K in the signal transduction pathway Hemmings B. A. 1997 Science 275 628 Hay N. 2005 Cancer Cell 8 179 183 . Akt is the human homologue of the protooncogene v akt of the acutely transforming retrovirus Akt8. Due to its high sequence homology to protein kinases A and C Akt is also called Protein Kinase B PKB and Related to A and C RAC . Three isoforms of Akt are known to exist namely Akt1 Akt2 and Akt3 which exhibit an overall homology of 80 Staal S. P. 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84 5034 Nakatani K. 1999 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257 906 Li et al 2002 Current Topics in Med. Chem. 2 939 971 WO 2005 113762 . The Akt isoforms share a common domain organization that consists of a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus a kinase catalytic domain and a short regulatory region at the C terminus. In addition both Akt2 and Akt3 exhibit splice variants. Upon recruitment to the cell membrane by PtdInd 3 4 5 P Akt is phosphorylated activated by PDK1 at T308 T309 and T305 for isoforms Akt1 PKB Akt2 PKB and Akt3 PKB respectively and at S473 5474 and S472 for isoforms Akt1 Akt2 and Akt3 respectively. Such phosphorylation occurs by an as yet unknown kinase putatively named PDK2 although PDK1 Balendran A. 1999 Curr. Biol. 9 393 autophosphorylation Toker A. 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 8271 and integrin linked kinase ILK Delcommenne M. 1998 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 11211 have been implicated in this process. Akt activation requires its phosphorylation on residue Ser 473 in the C terminal hydrophobic motif Brodbeck et al 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274 9133 9136 Coffer et al 1991 Eur. J. Biochem. 201 475 481 Alessi et al 1997 Curr. Biol. 7 261 269 . Although monophosphorylation of Akt activates the kinase bis phosphorylation is required for maximal kinase activity.

Akt is believed to assert its effect on cancer by suppressing apoptosis and enhancing both angiogenesis and proliferation Toker et al. 2006 Cancer Res. 66 8 3963 3966 . Akt is overexpressed in many forms of human cancer including but not limited to colon Zinda et al 2001 Clin. Cancer Res. 7 2475 ovarian Cheng et al 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 9267 brain Haas Kogan et al 1998 Curr. Biol. 8 1195 lung Brognard et al 2001 Cancer Res. 61 3986 pancreatic Bellacosa et al 1995 Int. J. Cancer 64 280 285 Cheng et al 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93 3636 3641 prostate Graff et al 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 24500 and gastric carcinomas Staal et al 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 5034 5037 .

The development of kinase inhibitors that target abnormally regulated pathways and ultimately result in disease is of enormous ethical and commercial interest to the medical and pharmaceutical community. A compound that inhibits 1 recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane 2 activation by PDK1 or PDK2 3 substrate phosphorylation or 4 one of the downstream targets of Akt could be a valuable anticancer agent either as a stand alone therapy or in conjunction with other accepted procedures.

Inhibitors of Akt are known see for example United States Patent Application Publication 2005 0130954 United States Patent Application Publication 2008 0058327 United States Patent Application Publication 2008 0051399 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2006 090261.

It is to be understood that in instances where two or more radicals are used in succession to define a substituent attached to a structure the first named radical is considered to be terminal and the last named radical is considered to be attached to the structure in question. Thus for example an arylalkyl radical is attached to the structure in question by the alkyl group.

Groups may be used recursively and may appear in the same structure more than one time. It is to be understood that the recursive groups can have independent and distinct values. As one example in certain embodiments the group Rmay appear recursively such as in the structure

Compounds of Formula I are useful for inhibiting protein kinases for example Akt protein kinases. Such compounds have utility as therapeutic agents for diseases that can be treated by the inhibition of the Akt protein kinase signaling pathway and tyrosine and serine threonine kinase receptor pathways.

In particular certain compounds of Formula I wherein Ris OH were found to be at least 50 fold more selective for Akt versus protein kinase A PKA . For example at least 100 fold and as a further example at least 150 fold more selective for Akt versus PKA. Selectivity over PKA is desirable since PKA is involved in many cellular processes important for the normal function and physiology of many cell types. Additionally inhibition of PKA is not believed to contribute to the anti proliferative and pro apoptotic effects of Akt inhibition. Thus inhibition of PKA could lead to adverse events not associated with Ala inhibition without contributing to the disease modifying benefits of Akt inhibition.

The compounds of Formula I can also be useful as inhibitors of tyrosine kinases as well as serine and threonine kinases in addition to Akt.

The compounds of this invention can possess one or more asymmetric centers such compounds can therefore be produced as individual R or S stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures racemic or otherwise thereof. Accordingly this invention also includes all such isomers including diastereomeric mixtures pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of this invention. The term enantiomer refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another. The term diastereomer refers to a pair of optical isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities.

The compounds of the present invention can also exist in different tautomeric forms and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

In the structures shown herein where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

The compounds of Formula I include solvates pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs and salts including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition is compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate can also be used to refer to a complex wherein the solvent molecule is water.

A prodrug is a compound that can be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue or a polypeptide chain of two or more e.g. two three or four amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine 4 hydroxyproline hydroxylysine demosine isodemosine gamma carboxyglutamate hippuric acid octahydroindole 2 carboxylic acid statine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid penicillamine ornithine 3 methylhistidine norvaline beta alanine gamma aminobutyric acid cirtulline homocysteine homoserine methyl alanine para benzoylphenylalanine phenylglycine propargylglycine sarcosine methionine sulfone and tert butylglycine.

Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula I can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as but not limited to a phosphate ester hemisuccinate dimethylaminoacetate or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group as outlined in 1996 19 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included as are carbonate prodrugs sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as acyloxy methyl and acyloxy ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in 1996 39 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxy carbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

Free amines of compounds of Formula I can also be derivatized as amides sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties can incorporate groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl wherein R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl or benzyl or R carbonyl is a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl natural aminoacyl C OH C O OY wherein Y is H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl or C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl.

Kakeya et al. 32 692 1984 each of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.

Alternatively or additionally compound of the invention can possess a sufficiently acidic group a sufficiently basic group or both functional groups and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases or acids to form a salt. Examples of salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base such salts including but not limited to sulfates pyrosulfates bisulfates sulfites bisulfites phosphates monohydrogenphosphates dihydrogenphosphates metaphosphates pyrophosphates chlorides bromides iodides acetates propionates decanoates caprylates acrylates formates isobutyrates caproates heptanoates propiolates oxalates malonates succinates suberates sebacates fumarates maleates butyn 1 4 dioates hexyne 1 6 dioates benzoates chlorobenzoates methylbenzoates dinitrobenzoates hydroxybenzoates methoxybenzoates phthalates sulfonates xylenesulfonates phenylacetates phenylpropionates phenylbutyrates citrates lactates hydroxybutyrates glycollates tartrates methanesulfonates propanesulfonates naphthalene 1 sulfonates naphthalene 2 sulfonates and mandelates. Since a single compound of the present invention can include more than one acidic or basic moiety the compounds of the present invention can include mono di or tri salts in a single compound.

In one example in the case where the compound has basic properties the desired salt can be prepared by any method available in the art for example by treatment of the free base with an acidic compound for example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like or with an organic acid such as acetic acid maleic acid succinic acid mandelic acid fumaric acid malonic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid an alpha hydroxy acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid or the like.

In another example in the case where the compound has acidic properties the desired salt can be prepared by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art for example by treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base. Examples of inorganic salts include those formed with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium sodium potassium barium and calcium. Examples of organic base salts for use include for example ammonium dibenzylammonium benzylammonium 2 hydroxyethylammonium bis 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium phenylethylbenzylamine dibenzylethylenediamine and the like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties can include for example those salts formed with procaine quinine and N methylglucosamine plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine ornithine histidine phenylglycine lysine and arginine.

In certain embodiments the salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt which unless otherwise indicated includes salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the corresponding free acid or base of the specified compound and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable.

The compounds of Formula I also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts and which can be useful as intermediates for preparing and or purifying compounds of Formula I and or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N N O O O P P S F Cl and I. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements . Positron emitting isotopes such as O N C and F are useful for positron emission tomography PET studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples herein below by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of compounds of Formula I described herein. A metabolite is a pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof.

In any of the synthetic methods for preparing compounds of Formula I it can be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.

Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a reaction mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product unreacted starting material reaction by product or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon molecular sieves ion exchange media or the like. Alternatively the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material bases in the case of an acidic material binding reagents such as antibodies binding proteins selective chelators such as crown ethers liquid liquid ion extraction reagents LIX or the like.

Selection of the method for separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction and the like.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an optically active compound for example a chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column as known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Crystallization is another exemplary method for separating enantiomers. In another embodiment compounds of Formula I can include atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls which can be separated using for example chromatographic methods of separation.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. . 1975 113 3 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any method known to one skilled in the art including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Drug Stereochemistry Analytical Methods and Pharmacology Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts can be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III. . 1982 47 4165 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Chiral Liquid Chromatography 1989 W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York Okamoto . 1990 513 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

A compound of Formula I and the additional pharmaceutically active drug s can be administered together in a unitary pharmaceutical composition or separately and when administered separately this can occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. Such sequential administration can be close in time or remote in time. The amounts of the compound of this invention and the second drug s and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.

The combination therapy can provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

To perform the assay stock solutions of compounds at 10 mM in DMSO are prepared. The stock solutions and the control compound are serially diluted 1 2 nine times into DMSO 10 L of compound 10 L of DMSO to give 50 dilution series over the desired dosing range. Next 2.1 4 aliquots of the compounds in DMSO are transferred to a Costar 3657 plate containing 50 L of 10.4 M ATP in 1 IMAP Reaction Buffer containing 1 mM DTT. After thorough mixing 2.5 L aliquots are transferred to a ProxyPlate 384 F plate.

The assay is initiated by the addition of 2.5 L aliquots of a solution containing 200 nM of fluorescently labeled peptide substrate and 4 nM Akt 1. The plate is centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 g and incubated for 60 minute at ambient temperature. The reaction is then quenched by the addition of 15 L of Binding Solution centrifuged again and incubated for an additional 30 minutes at ambient temperature prior to reading on a Victor 1420 Multilabel HTS Counter configured to measure fluorescence polarization.

The compounds of Examples 1 66 were tested in the above assay and found to have an ICof less than about 10 M. The compounds of Examples 1 101 were tested in the above assay and found to have an ICof less than about 10 M. Many of the compounds have an ICof less than about 1 M.
