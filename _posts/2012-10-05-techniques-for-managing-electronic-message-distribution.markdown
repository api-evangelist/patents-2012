The present disclosure relates generally to electronic messaging and more particularly to techniques for managing electronic message distribution.

Protection of email content distributed from an email server to a mobile device is important when the content of the email includes sensitive information. Conventional mobile email distribution tools may convert all emails distributed to the mobile device into an HTML markup such that when the email is viewed or read a webpage is loaded from a server instead of downloading and locally storing the email message on the mobile device. However conversion of all emails to an HTML markup limits the usability of the mobile device. For example a user of the mobile device may not be able to access or read any emails on the mobile device when there is no available network connection or connection to the email server. In view of the foregoing it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current electronic message distribution management technologies.

Further the modules may be implemented across multiple devices and or other components local or remote to one another. Additionally the modules may be moved from one device and added to another device and or may be included in both devices.

In some embodiments varying portions of the electronic message management module may be arranged at the server A and the server B. In addition the message analysis module the message content analysis module the message client location determination module the message classification module and the security policy determination and application module may be arranged at a location separate from the sync request identification module the new message identification module and the message transmission module . For example the sync request identification module the new message identification module and the message transmission module may be arranged at an email sever while the message analysis module the message content analysis module the message client location determination module the message classification module and the security policy determination and application module may be arranged at a separate server. Accordingly the modules arranged at the separate server may perform analysis of an electronic message and transmit a result of the analysis of the electronic message to the email server without informing the email server of the specific criteria or policy used to analyze the electronic message.

The sync request identification module may determine whether a request has been received from a message client to synchronize message. In some embodiments the message client is a mobile device e.g. smartphone that supports mobile email with Microsoft ActiveSync to send and receive emails such that the request is to synchronize its mailbox. The sync request identification module may be arranged at an email server e.g. Exchange server to determine whether a request has been received directly from the message client. In other embodiments the sync request identification module may be arranged at an email proxy e.g. a Microsoft ActiveSync proxy to determine whether a query for new messages has been received from the message client e.g. a mobile device via a network. Accordingly when it is determined that the query has been received at the sync request identification module arranged at the email proxy the sync request identification module may then transmit a request to synchronize to an email server e.g. a Microsoft Exchange server . Further upon determination that a request to synchronize has been received from the message client a query may be sent to the new message identification module to determine whether there is a new message to be transmitted to the message client.

The new message identification module may be arranged at the email sever to determine whether a new message has been received at the email server that has yet to be transmitted to the message client. In some embodiments the new message identification module may be arranged at an email proxy e.g. a Microsoft ActiveSync proxy to intercept an electronic message before it is transmitted to the target message client. The new message identification module may perform the determination of whether a new message has been received in response to the query sent from the sync request identification module . In some embodiments the new message may be from a sender outside of a recipient s network utilizing the simple mail transfer SMTP standard or from within the recipient s network and the email server may store the message until it can be transmitted to the message client.

The message analysis module may analyze multiple elements of the new message identified by the new message identification module . In some embodiments the message analysis module may identify the sender of the message and determine whether the sender is within the recipient s organization or external to the recipient s organization. The message analysis module may also determine whether the sender has specified a specific security policy to be applied to the message. Additionally the message analysis module may identify the recipient of the message and analyze the subject of the message. Further the message analysis module may analyze additional fields within a header of the new message to identify further information about the message. For example the message analysis module may analyze the multiple elements of the new message to determine whether any satisfy a preset condition such as including a keyword e.g. confidential or being addressed from a sender that communicates sensitive information.

The message content analysis module may analyze different content elements of the new message identified by the message identification module . In some embodiments the message content analysis module may determine whether the new message includes an attachment. In particular the message content analysis module may determine whether the new message contains an attachment of a specific format e.g. a Microsoft Excel file a Microsoft Word file or a pdf . In other embodiments the message content analysis module may also analyze the body of the new message to determine whether the message contains one of a plurality of predetermined keywords. For example an administrator or user may set a list of sensitive keywords e.g. budget private sensitive and confidential and the message content analysis module may analyze the body of the message to determine whether the message includes one of the keywords. Further the message content analysis module may analyze the content of an attachment to determine whether it includes one of the keywords.

The message client location determination module may determine a location of the message client e.g. mobile device from which the request to synchronize has been received from. In some embodiments the message client location determination module may determine the location of the message client based on information which specifies the location of the message client transmitted by the message client within the request to synchronize. For example the message client may include a global positioning system GPS component that may determine the location of the message client and transmit the determined location within the query. In other embodiments the message client location determination module may determine that the location of the message client is unidentified.

The message classification module may classify the new message based on the results from the message analysis module the message content analysis module and the message client location determination module . In some embodiments a user may specify a plurality of message classifications each having a different classification criteria. For example a user may specify multiple low security level classifications multiple moderate security level classifications and multiple high security level classifications. The message classes may be based on any one of a variety of factors including for example the recipient s identification the sender s identification the location of the recipient the location of the sender whether the sender is within the recipient s organization and the content of the message. Further the user may vary the message classifications at any time to create new classifications or to modify the existing classifications.

In some embodiments the message classification module may classify the new message as a first security class having a low level of security when the new message does not include any preset keywords any attachments and the message client is determined to be within a trusted network or within the recipient s organization. In other embodiments the message classification module may classify the new message as a second security class having a moderate level of security when the new message contains an attachment of a predetermined type e.g. a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or a preset keyword. Further the message classification module may classify the new message as a third security class having a high level of security when the message client is determined to be outside of a trusted network or outside of a trusted geographic region e.g. country .

The security policy determination and application module may determine an appropriate security policy to apply to the new message based on the classification of the new message by the message classification module and the determination results from the message client location determination module . In some embodiments multiple security policies may be preset by an administrator or user such that each security policy specifies a different level of message distribution security. For example each security policy may specify how an email message is to be distributed to a user of a mobile device. Further the administrator or user may specify that the plurality of security policies each correspond to the message classifications and whether the location of the message client is identifiable.

In one embodiment a first security policy may a low level security. For example the first security policy may correspond to the first security classification and specify that a message may be transmitted to the message client without modification and in a locally cacheable form. A second security policy corresponding to the second security classification and have a moderate level of security. For example the second security policy may specify that a message may be delivered as a message containing a body of unmodified cacheable content and an attachment as converted non cacheable content. In particular the non cacheable content e.g. an attachment may be converted into HTML format such that when a user of the message client attempts to view the non cacheable content the message client retrieves the content from a server displays the content to the user and does not cache that specific content.

In another embodiment a third security policy may have a moderate level of security different from the second security policy. For example the third security policy may specify that a portion of the body of a message may be transmitted in a locally cacheable form whereas a portion of the message containing a keyword is replaced with non cacheable content in webmail form. Further a fourth security policy may correspond to the third message classification and specify that the entire message body and any attachments is to be converted to a non cacheable webmail format before being transmitted to the message client.

The security policy determination and application module may also determine the appropriate security policy to apply not only to a single new message but also to all messages e.g. email messages associated with the message client e.g. mobile device . For example when the message client location determination module determines that the location of the message client is unidentified a fifth security policy having a highest level of security may be selected. In particular the fifth security policy may specify that all of the emails locally cached on the message client are to be replaced with non cacheable webmail messages and all new messages are to be converted into non cacheable webmail messages until the location of the message client may be determined.

Additionally when the message client location determination module determines that the location of the mobile device is located in a trusted home network a sixth security policy having a lowest level of security may be selected. For example the sixth security policy may specify that all messages are to be transmitted to the message client without modification and in a locally cacheable form regardless of whether a new message is determined to include an attachment and a keyword. In other embodiments when the sender has specified a particular security policy the security policy determination and application module may either apply the security policy specified by the sender or a security policy having a higher level of security based on the analysis of the new message described above.

The security policy determination and application module may then apply the determined security policy. In some embodiments the security policy determination and application module may allow the new message to be transmitted by the message transmission module without modification when a low level security policy has been determined. In other embodiments the security policy determination and application module may modify the entire content e.g. message body and attachments of the new message into a non cacheable form when a higher level security policy has been determined. For example the entire new message content may be replaced with an HTML iFrame and a copy of the new message content may be rendered into the iFrame such that the content of the new message cannot be cached onto the message client e.g. mobile device .

In further embodiments the security policy determination and application module may modify only a portion of the new message when a moderate level security policy has been determined. For example a portion of the new message content may be replaced with an HTML iFrame and a copy of the specified portion of the new message content may be rendered into the iFrame. In other embodiments the security policy determination and application module may convert an attachment of the message into a non cacheable format.

Furthermore the security policy determination and application module may apply an updated security policy to all of the messages within the user s account. For example when the message client location determination module determines that the client is within a home area e.g. a trusted local area network all messages may be transmitted to the client in a cacheable format. However when the message client location determination module determines that the client has moved to an area outside of the home area e.g. to a foreign country the security policy determination and application module may automatically apply a security policy having a higher level of security.

In some embodiments when the message client location determination module determines that the location of the client is unknown the security policy determination and application module may automatically apply the security policy having the highest level of security to all message associated with the message client. Further when the message client location determination module determines that the location of the message client is now within the trusted home network the security policy may be updated to the lowest level and all messages may be delivered to the message client in a cacheable form.

The message transmission module may transmit the new message to its intended recipient after the security policy determination and application module has applied the appropriate security policy. In some embodiments the message transmission module may transmit the new message in its original form without modification according to the lowest level security policy. In other embodiments the message transmission module transmit the message which has been modified such that a portion of the message content is delivered to the message client as an HTML iFrame according to a moderate level security policy. Accordingly when a user attempts to read the content of the new message transmitted by the message transmission module the message client may then retrieve the content of the message from a server in the HTML format. In additional embodiments the message transmission module may transmit the new message in which the content has been converted to a webmail format such that no cacheable content is delivered to the message client.

At block it may be determined whether a synchronization request has been received from a message client. In some embodiments the determination of whether the synchronization request has been received may be performed the sync request identification module described above. The synchronization request may be a request to synchronize an email message mailbox at the message client e.g. a mobile device with a corresponding email message mailbox at an email server e.g. Microsoft Exchange server . In some embodiments the message client may be a mobile device that connects to the email server via an ActiveSync proxy. In other embodiments the client may be a mobile device that directly connects to the email server via a network.

Further the determination at block may be performed by the sync request identification module arranged at one of an ActiveSync proxy or an email server. If it is determined at block that a synchronization request has been received from the message client then the process proceeds to block . However if it is determined at block that a synchronization request has not been received from the message client then the process repeats block until a it is determined that a request has been received.

At block it may be determined whether a new message has been received at the server e.g. email server that has yet to be transmitted to the message client. In some embodiments the determination of block may be performed by the new message identification module discussed above. Further a new email message specifying an email account associated with the message client e.g. a mobile device may be received at the email server and stored until a request to synchronize the message client s email mailbox has been received. If it is determined at block that no new messages are present the process proceeds to block to complete the synchronization. In some embodiments information may be transmitted to the message client indicating that no new messages are present. However if it is determined at block that a new email message is present the process may proceed to block .

At block the new message identified at block may be analyzed. In some embodiments the new message may be a new email message that is analyzed by the message content analysis module . The new message may be analyzed at an ActiveSync proxy an email server or a separate third party service e.g. Data Loss Prevention from Symantec arranged at a location different from the proxy and email server. For example a header and a body of the email message may be analyzed. The analysis of the message will be described in detail below with respect to . Upon completion of the analysis of the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block a location of the message client may be determined. In some embodiments the location of the message client is determined by the client location determination module described above. For example the location of the message client e.g. mobile device may be determined by the message client and reported with the synchronization request e.g. within a header of the request . In some embodiments the location of the message client may determined as unidentified. Further the location of the message client may be determined to be a geographic location based on for example GPS data or an IP address. The geographic location may be a specific latitude and longitude a location within a specified area a city a state a country or a continent or any other user defined area. Additionally in some embodiments the location of the message client may be determined to be a network location such as for example a specific IP address within a home network a location within a home network a location within a trusted network or a location an within a network outside of a trusted or home network.

In other embodiments the message client may be configured to render messages based on HTML5 and according may request location information. In additional embodiments a user of the message client may be required to report their location via an HTML interface on the message client. Further an application or program may be installed on the message client that reports the location of the message client to the message client location determination module outside of the query or via a different channel. Upon completion of determining the location of the message client the process may proceed to block .

At block the new message may be classified according to a plurality of preset message classifications. In some embodiments the classification of the new message may be performed by the message classification module described above. For example the new message may be given any one of a low security classification a moderate security classification and a high security classification based on the results of blocks and .

At block an appropriate security policy may be determined and applied to the new message based on the results of blocks . In some embodiments the determination and application of the security policy may be performed by the security policy determination and application module described above. Further the appropriate security policy may be determined to be any one of a low level security policy a moderate level security policy a high level security policy or any other preset or user defined security policy. In some embodiments the determined location of the message client from block may be given priority over the results from the analysis of the new message from block . For example if it is determined at block that the location of the message client is unidentified then a security policy having a high level of security e.g. convert all message content to webmail HTML format may be selected and applied regardless of the results of the message analysis from block .

In some embodiments the security policy may be determined to be a low security policy and according the new message may be transmitted from the server to the message client without modification. In other embodiments the security policy may be determined to be a moderate security policy and according a portion of the new message may be converted into a non cacheable format and then the entire message may be transmitted from the server to the message client. Upon completion of the selection of the appropriate security policy and the application of the selected security policy to the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block the new message having the security policy applied at block is delivered to the message client via a network. In some embodiments the delivery of the new message may be performed by the message transmission module described above. For example when the message client is a mobile device the message e.g. email message may be transmitted over a cellular network or any other wireless network to the message client.

At block the intended recipient included in a header of new message may be analyzed. In some embodiments the analysis of the message recipient may be performed by the message analysis module described above. For example the recipient may be identified as a known email address within a home email system e.g. within an organization or an unknown email address outside of the home email system e.g. outside the organization . Upon determination of the intended recipient of the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block the sender included in a header of the new message may be analyzed. In some embodiments the analysis of the message sender may be performed by the message analysis module described above. For example the sender may be identified as a known email address within the home email system e.g. within an organization or an unknown email address outside of the home email system e.g. outside the organization . Upon determination of the sender of the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block a subject of the new message may be analyzed. In some embodiments the analysis of the message subject may be performed by the message analysis module described above. For example the subject of the new message may analyzed to determine if it includes a preset keyword. Further at block additional message fields such as a carbon copy CC field a blind carbon copy BCC field or any other field contained within a message header may be analyzed to determine whether a condition set according to any one of the above identified message classifications is satisfied. Upon completion of the analysis of the subject of the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block a body of the new message which may contain any one of plain text Rich Text Format and or HTML may be analyzed. In some embodiments the analysis of the body of the new message may be performed by the message content analysis module described above. For example the entire content of the message body may be analyzed to determine whether the message contains a preset keyword. For instance the body of the new message may be analyzed to determine whether it includes the word budget. Upon completion of the analysis of the body of the new message the process may proceed to block .

At block the new message is analyzed to determine whether it includes any attachments and when it is determined to include an attachment a format of the attachment may be determined. In some embodiments the analysis of the attachments may be performed by the message content analysis module described above. For example the new message may be analyzed and it may be determined that the new message includes a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Further the content of the attachment may be analyzed to determine whether it includes any one of a plurality of preset keywords.

At this point it should be noted that electronic message distribution management in accordance with the present disclosure as described above may involve the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software.
