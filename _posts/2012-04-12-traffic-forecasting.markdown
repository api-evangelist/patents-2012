Within the field of computing route navigation may comprise receiving a destination and providing an estimated travel time and navigation instructions e.g. turn by turn directions thereto. For example an application may provide directions and or a map to a destination based upon a location e.g. origin of a traveler e.g. a current location for the traveler . Such an application may for example execute on a location aware device such as a smartphone equipped with a global positioning system GPS for example. A location aware device may also have access to mapping information and be capable of providing routing information for example.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form which are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Among other things one or more techniques and or systems for traffic forecasting are disclosed to facilitate more efficient departure timing and or navigation by providing an outlook of anticipated traffic flow e.g. a predicted traffic pattern for an area and or a route e.g. associated with travel from an origin and destination for example. It may be desirable for a traveler e.g. commuter user of a global positioning system and or device GPS driver biker pedestrian etc. to mitigate and or reduce an amount of time spent on the roadway and or in traffic e.g. therefore potentially increasing an amount of time for personal utility for example. In one embodiment a traveler may enter an input location and be provided with a predicted traffic pattern. The predicted traffic pattern may be associated with navigation e.g. turn by turn directions and or be specific to a route for a traveler and may be based upon traffic data e.g. historical traffic data current traffic data and or predicted traffic data for example. Additionally a suggested departure time may be provided to mitigate travel time to and or from a destination for example. The suggested departure time may be based on predictions estimations and or simulations associated with reducing travel time by modifying a departure time to mitigate encounters with traffic e.g. avoid traffic jams for example.

In one embodiment for forecasting traffic an input destination may be received and or accepted and a corresponding route may be calculated e.g. a route from an origin location to the input destination may be determined . For example if an input destination of home is received a route comprising turn by turn navigation from a current location to home may be generated. In one embodiment a set of predicted traffic data e.g. traffic data associated with the input destination and or route may be generated and or analyzed for a corresponding future departure time. For example traffic associated with a route and or input destination may generally be heavy e.g. based on historical traffic data at five o clock e.g. a first future departure time but may be lighter at six o clock e.g. a second future departure time . To this end a predicted traffic pattern may be generated to reflect such activity for the route. As another example if a professional sporting event is scheduled to end around eight o clock a predicted traffic pattern may be generated and or analyzed to reflect activity which may occur on associated roadways e.g. in response to the sporting event traffic for example . Additionally a set of current traffic data e.g. indicative of real time activity on a roadway for example associated with the input destination may be analyzed. For example if a traveler utilizes a route from an origin location to a destination location and the route comprises a roadway with a traffic accident current traffic data may be analyzed and or generated to reflect the accident accordingly e.g. a status of the accident a time the accident began a type of accident etc. . To this end a suggested departure time may be provided the suggested departure time based on traffic data associated with an input destination. Traffic data may comprise current traffic data e.g. traffic accidents predicted traffic data e.g. based on an anticipated travel plan sporting event ending etc. and or historical traffic data. For example if a traffic jam associated with rush hour e.g. current traffic data historically clears after twenty minutes e.g. historical traffic data along a portion of a route a predicted traffic pattern e.g. anticipating the rush hour traffic may clear after twenty minutes may be provided based on current traffic data and or historical traffic data.

In another embodiment one or more traffic patterns e.g. current traffic pattern and or predicted traffic pattern may be displayed and or presented for example. That is for example a current traffic pattern may be displayed e.g. a status of traffic activity on a roadway in real time and or based on recent activity . Additionally one or more predicted traffic patterns may be generated and or presented based on one or more corresponding future departure times. For example predicted traffic patterns and or estimated travel time may be presented in fifteen minute increments. That is for example a traveler may be presented with multiple departure time options e.g. comprising a travel time estimate a predicted traffic pattern associated with departure at a current time a first future departure time fifteen minutes from the current time a second future departure time thirty minutes from the current time and or a third future departure time forty five minutes from the current time etc. . In one embodiment predicted traffic patterns may be color coded to represent a traffic level e.g. red may represent a severely congested roadway and green may represent a less congested roadway . In one embodiment the predicted traffic pattern display may comprise traffic information corresponding to an area e.g. a radius around a GPS device associated with a traveler zip code suburb city etc. In another embodiment the predicted traffic pattern display may comprise traffic information e.g. estimated travel time for a route e.g. traffic information associated with turn by turn directions from an origin location to a destination location for example.

According to one aspect a suggested departure time may be provided based on an input destination e.g. and or traffic data associated with the input location . For example if a traveler is commuting from work to home a suggested departure time of four thirty may be provided based on current traffic data historical traffic data and or predicted traffic data associated with a route for the commute. That is for example an estimated travel time for the traveler may be twenty minutes at four thirty and thirty minutes at five o clock e.g. based on historical traffic data . Accordingly a suggested departure time of four thirty may be presented to the traveler. Moreover in response to a traveler accepting a suggested departure time e.g. an indication by the traveler that he or she plans to leave at the suggested time and or an indication of an actual departure in accordance with the suggested departure time the accepted suggestion may be associated with predicted traffic data to update predicted traffic patterns e.g. predicted traffic data thereafter. For example if a large number of travelers accept a same and or similar suggested departure time associated with at least a portion of a route e.g. the travelers plan on driving along a common interstate route around a same and or similar time predicted traffic data may be updated accordingly. Therefore travelers may be provided with a traffic forecast to facilitate more desirable e.g. reduced travel times.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Among other things one or more techniques and or systems for traffic forecasting are disclosed to facilitate more efficient departure and or navigation for example. According to one aspect predicted traffic patterns may be provided to enable a traveler to decide when to leave for a destination for example. Moreover predicted traffic patterns may be displayed concurrently e.g. a juxtaposition of a current traffic pattern and one or more predicted traffic patterns to educate travelers on relationships between traffic and departure times. Additionally traffic patterns may be color coded based on a level of congestion for example. That is for example high traffic areas may be designated and or identified by red while lower traffic areas may be colored green and intermediate level traffic may be coded yellow e.g. or one or more transitions between any colors may be used to illustrate variations in a traffic pattern . A suggested departure time may be provided to facilitate reduced travel time from an origin to a destination for example. Moreover if a traveler accepts and or utilizes a suggested departure time predicted traffic data may be updated accordingly. It will be appreciated that an input destination and or location may comprise an area e.g. zip code city radius around a GPS location etc. and or a route e.g. travel and or turn by turn navigation from point A to point B .

A predicted traffic pattern may be generated based on input location traffic data e.g. and or routes calculated using the input location etc. for example. That is for example if a traveler enters a sports stadium as an input location a predicted traffic pattern e.g. associated with a route from an origin location to the sports stadium may be generated and or presented to the traveler e.g. based on traffic data associated with the input location . To this end travelers may be provided with details pertaining to anticipated traffic patterns in response to a received input location for example. In one embodiment a predicted e.g. anticipated and or forecasted traffic pattern may be provided based on a fifteen minute lag e.g. or any other interval s from a current time for example. That is for example if a current time is twelve o clock the predicted traffic pattern may be indicative of an anticipated status of traffic activity e.g. associated with a route etc. for the input location at twelve fifteen. In one embodiment a predicted traffic pattern e.g. as illustrated in may be displayed on a map for example.

As will be further described with respect to for example in one embodiment the predicted traffic pattern may be displayed within a user interface comprising at least two maps where at least one of the two maps is based upon the predicted traffic pattern. By way of example a user interface may comprise two maps where a first map illustrates the predicted traffic pattern and a second map illustrates current traffic information e.g. based upon real time and or predicted traffic data . As another example the user interface may comprise multiple maps respectively depicting future traffic patterns at different times. For example a first map may display predicted traffic patterns at 6 00 pm while another map may display predicted traffic patterns at 6 30 pm.

At a predicted traffic pattern may be generated e.g. based on historical traffic data current traffic data and or predicted traffic data . In one embodiment predicted traffic pattern may be indicative of an anticipated traffic status at a future time. For example the predicted traffic pattern may be generated based on one or more future departure times e.g. anticipated traffic fifteen minutes from a present time half an hour from a present time etc. . For example if a roadway generally becomes congested around six o clock a predicted traffic pattern may be generated based on historical traffic data indicative of the six o clock traffic jams. Multiple e.g. one or more future departure times may be utilized to facilitate generation of predicted traffic patterns and provide a spectrum of departure times for traveler consideration for example. For example a traveler may utilize a predicted traffic pattern to select a desirable departure time. To this end a predicted traffic pattern may be based upon traffic pattern data comprising historical traffic data current traffic data and or predicted traffic data for example. Historical traffic data may comprise an analysis of underlying roadway traffic data based on geography frequency of accidents and or delays construction average traffic jam time etc. In one embodiment historic traffic data may be logged and or tracked based on GPS signals received from travelers for example. That is for example if GPS signals indicate that a large number of travelers e.g. in automobiles equipped with GPS are stationary and or moving slowly on an interstate historic traffic data and or current traffic data may be logged indicating factors e.g. a sporting event ended time of day day of the week a report overturned semi truck school bus etc. associated with the traffic jam. As an example if a school bus routinely drops children off from two to three o clock historical traffic data may be collected to reflect the school bus activity. In one embodiment if the school bus is equipped with GPS equipment current traffic data may be logged updated collected and or recorded in addition to the historical traffic data. Further factors associated with the bus transportation may be recorded and or associated with the historical traffic data. For example if a state track meet is held annually at a location and at a time GPS associated with the track meet transportation may be tagged and recorded e.g. if a date for the track meet is changed to a new date predicted traffic data may be updated accordingly upon notification of the change .

Current traffic data may be collected from a variety of sources such as news and or radio stations for example. According to one aspect current traffic data may be used to facilitate generation and or analysis of the predicted traffic pattern. For example a predicted traffic pattern may be based upon a current traffic jam e.g. current traffic data and historical traffic jam clear times e.g. historical traffic jam data associated with a current day location month weather condition etc. That is for example if a traffic jam currently occupies a roadway e.g. based on a sporting event historical data pertaining to traffic associated with the sporting event may be used to generate a predicted traffic pattern e.g. the sports traffic jams typically clears in twenty five minutes to aid travelers with departure time decisions.

In one embodiment a predicted traffic pattern for a route associated with an input location may be analyzed on a node by node basis for example. According to one aspect a route and or traffic pattern data may be divided into one or more elements e.g. by time interval segments such as roadways and or by nodes . For example if a traveler utilizes a first roadway and a second roadway to reach a destination the predicted traffic pattern may be analyzed such that the first roadway comprises a first predicted traffic pattern e.g. associated with a first time slot for the trip and the second roadway comprises a second predicted traffic pattern e.g. associated with a second time slot for a second segment of the trip . That is for example if a traveler is expected to spend a first hour e.g. from one o clock to two o clock on roadway A and a second hour e.g. from two o clock to three o clock travelling on roadway B the predicted traffic pattern may be indicative of anticipated traffic on roadway A for the first time slot e.g. from one o clock to two o clock and also comprise a second portion of the predicted traffic pattern indicative of anticipated traffic on roadway B for the second time slot e.g. from two o clock to three o clock .

At one or more predicted traffic patterns may be displayed e.g. as illustrated in for one or more corresponding future departure times. For example a traffic forecast may be provided for traffic along a route and or traffic of an area in five minute intervals e.g. or any other interval s . In one embodiment a display for a predicted traffic pattern may comprise a color coded representation of traffic e.g. red representing a higher traffic roadway yellow representing an intermediate traffic roadway and green representing a lower traffic roadway for example .

A selection algorithm may be employed at to facilitate suggestions for departure times for example. In one embodiment a traveler may provide a time window for leaving a location. For example a traveler may indicate that he or she desires to leave work e.g. a location between four thirty and five thirty. A suggested departure time of four thirty may be provided based on one or more predicted traffic patterns associated with one or more corresponding departure times e.g. a four thirty future departure time a five o clock future departure time and or a five thirty future departure time . To this end the five thirty and or six o clock future departure times may be associated with an hour of travel time while the four thirty future departure time may merely be associated with a forty five minute segment of travel time. Therefore a suggested departure time of four thirty may be provided for this example. In another embodiment the selection algorithm may be configured to provide suggested departure times based on traveler preferences e.g. stopping for dinner etc. . According to one aspect if a traveler is en route to a destination a suggested break may be provided. For example if a traveler is sitting in traffic at a current location and it is determined that a predicted traffic pattern may result in a half hour travel time e.g. due to an accident such as an overturned semi truck to a destination regardless of the traveler s actions e.g. continuing to sit and wait in traffic or stopping to take a break a suggested break may be provided. To this end a traveler may take a suggested break and continue his or her journey e.g. potentially without a travel time penalty for example. The selection algorithm may account for a similar arrival time scenario comprising a first scenario where a traveler leaves at a first anticipated departure time of five o clock and has an anticipated arrival time of six o clock and a second scenario where a traveler leaves at a second anticipated departure time of five thirty and has a similar anticipated arrival time of six o clock. To this end the selection algorithm may provide a traveler with a suggested departure time of five thirty to promote a more desirable e.g. faster commute time for example.

In one embodiment a suggested speed may be provided for a route and or segments associated with the route. For example traffic data may comprise data pertaining to traffic light timing and it may be determined that traveling at a suggested speed may enable a traveler to flow e.g. keep moving through traffic lights e.g. rather than constantly speeding up and stopping for example. In one embodiment a suggested increase and or decrease in speed may be provided to facilitate navigation.

In one embodiment if a traveler indicates an acceptance of a suggested departure time e.g. and or follows the suggested departure time the suggested departure time may be associated with predicted traffic data. For example if hundreds of travelers receive a same suggested departure time and a route comprising a roadway common to the travelers predicted traffic data may be updated to reflect anticipated traffic based on acceptance of the suggested departure times for example. In another example predicted traffic data and or current traffic data may be updated and or verified based upon GPS signals and or devices. For example if a traveler routinely accepts a suggested departure time but often fails to follow the suggested departure time predicted traffic data may be updated with regard to a tendency of the traveler. As another example if a traveler is following a suggested departure time current traffic patterns and or current traffic data may be updated accordingly. To this end suggested departure times may be associated with predicted traffic patterns of and or current traffic patterns at . The exemplary method ends at thereafter.

A forecast component may be configured to provide a predicted traffic pattern associated with the input location for example. Forecast component may be configured to provide the predicted traffic pattern for an area and or a route associated with the input location as a destination for example.

A forecast component may be configured to provide one or more predicted traffic patterns associated with one or more corresponding future departure times.

Suggestion component may be configured to suggest a suggested departure time to user for example. In one embodiment a traveler may indicate a preference for historical data used to generate a predicted traffic pattern. In one embodiment a traveler may desire to utilize historical data from a past week past month similar weather condition and or past year to provide alternative sets of predicted traffic patterns e.g. associated with respective future departure times for example.

A mapping component may be configured to generate a map comprising at least some of the predicted traffic patterns to facilitate visualizations of at least some of the traffic patterns for the user . In one embodiment mapping component may be configured to generate a color coded map comprising a legend e.g. red may represent a busier roadway and green may represent a less busy roadway . According to one aspect predicted traffic patterns may be displayed by the mapping component in response to a click of a mouse or a swipe of a touch screen for example. For example a first traffic pattern for a first point in time may be displayed in response to a first swipe a second traffic pattern for a second point in time may be displayed in response to a second swipe and a third fourth etc. Time intervals between different points in time for which traffic patterns are displayed may be ascertained in any number of manners such as by user input according to a default setting automatically dynamically based upon variations in traffic patterns e.g. if traffic patterns are not expected to change in five minutes then time intervals may be greater than five minutes to provide more useful information to a user as opposed to a seemingly static traffic patterns . In one embodiment a traveler may determine a desired departure time based on at least some of the predicted traffic patterns. In another embodiment the mapping component may provide the user with the suggested departure time generated by suggestion component .

A display component may comprise a user interface and the display component may be configured to display predicted traffic patterns e.g. as illustrated in suggested departure times future departure times e.g. and associated travel times etc. and or turn by turn directions for the traveler . The display component may display current and or predicted traffic patterns for an area and or a route e.g. specific to a traveler for example. In one embodiment display component may be configured to provide one or more pairs of estimated departure and or arrival times from an origin location to a destination e.g. input location for example.

Traffic pattern database may comprise traffic data current traffic data historical traffic data and or predicted traffic data etc. In one embodiment traffic pattern database may collect and or aggregate traffic data from GPS devices for example. It will be appreciated that any of the components of and or may be configured to implement any of the acts of and or for example.

By way of example suppose that it is approximately 6 pm and a user is interested in visiting a local restaurant. The user may launch an application causing the application to display a user interface such as the user interface described in for example. A location of the user or rather the user s device may be determined and the user may be presented with a plurality of maps and . The maps and may illustrate traffic patterns within a region surrounding the user s determined location e.g. based upon GPS of the user s device . For example as illustrated herein three maps and e.g. which may also be referred to as tiles are presented to the user respectively depicting traffic patterns at different times. For example in the illustrated embodiment the maps and illustrate traffic patterns in 15 minute increments although other increments are contemplated herein . Thus a first map illustrates current traffic patterns for the region e.g. based upon real time historical and or predicted data a second map illustrates expected traffic patterns for the region at 6 15 15 minutes from now and a third map illustrates expected traffic patterns for the region at 6 30 30 minutes from now.

It will be appreciated that moderate and heavy traffic patterns are illustrated in the example maps via patterned lines. For example heavy traffic may be represented by dash dotted lines and moderate traffic may be represented by dotted lines. However other graphical representations of light moderate and or heavy traffic patterns are also contemplated. For example in one embodiment roads with light traffic patterns may be shaded green while roads with moderate traffic patterns are shaded yellow and roads with heavy traffic patterns are shaded red.

In the maps and illustrated with respect to it appears that traffic continues to get heavier as time passes. For example at 6 15 a larger portion of the middle vertical line is dotted meaning a greater amount of the road has moderate traffic. Moreover at 6 30 a portion of the bottom horizontal line is dotted meaning traffic is expected to increase on that portion of the road by 6 30. As such if a user were determining whether to leave at 6 6 15 or 6 30 the user may determine it is best to leave now at 6 before traffic becomes worse.

In one embodiment the user interface may further comprise an enlarged map section configured to display an enlarged view of one or more of the maps and . For example in the illustrated embodiment of the user interface the map labeled now is displayed in the enlarged map section . Based upon an indication of a desire to enlarge a different one of the displayed maps and the map displayed in the enlarged map section may change. For example a user may indicate a selection of a different map e.g. by swiping dragging doubling tapping etc. on one or more of the displayed maps and and the user interface may present the selected map in the enlarged map section . However other techniques for enlarging and or shrinking a map are also contemplated. For example in another example maps may be enlarged via a fish eye technique. As an example a user may place a finger over the upper left portion of the user interface causing the map labeled now to be enlarged. If an indication indicative of the finger sliding across the screen e.g. from left to right is received the user interface may enlarge shrink respective maps based upon the movement e.g. such that the map represented in a region nearest the region of the finger comprises the greatest enlargement for example.

It will be appreciated that although the example user interface provides for concurrently displaying three maps fewer than three or more than three maps may be displayed within the user interface and may depend upon among things the screen size of the device displaying the user interface . For example a user interface presented on a cellular telephone may present merely two maps concurrently while a user interface presented on a tablet device e.g. which may have a much larger screen may present four or more maps concurrently. Further in one embodiment the maps and may be presented in a slider for example and the user can drag one or more of the maps and off the display for example causing the user interface to display additional new maps. For example if a user wanted to view a map of predicted traffic at 6 45 the user may drag the map labeled now to the left of the user interface e.g. causing it to appear as though it dropped off the display and a map of predicted traffic at 6 45 may be presented to the right of the map labeled 6 30. It may be appreciated that the size of respective maps within the user interface and or the availability of an enlarged map section may depended upon screen size as well for example.

In one embodiment the maps presented in the user interface may be personalized to a user based upon more than the input location. illustrates an example user interface for displaying two or more maps concurrently. More specifically the user interface displays maps and that are further customized based upon additional information about the user e.g. such as a user s desired beginning ending location relative to the maps displayed with respect to the user interface of . For example suppose a user entered into the user interface his her current location as a beginning point and specified a destination e.g. such as by name or location . Based upon this information maps and may be displayed that merely illustrate roads a user may travel to reach the specified destination e.g. as represented by a flag and or may merely illustrate a region inclusive of the beginning location and the destination e.g. reducing noise of traffic on other roads routes etc. that the user is not interested in .

Moreover the user interface may present information about an expected time of arrive at destination if the user leaves at a given time. For example at illustrated with respect to the map illustrating present traffic conditions a user that leaves now e.g. at 6 00 may be expected to arrive at his her destination at 6 45 based upon current travel conditions and an identified route of travel e.g. which may include the fastest route given traffic information and or the shortest route based upon mileage for example . However if the user were to leave at 6 15 it may be predicted that the user would arrive at his her destination at 6 50 based upon predicted future traffic considerations e.g. meaning a total travel time of 35 minutes which is less than the 45 minutes of travel time predicted if the user left now at 6 as shown by the map illustrating traffic patterns at 6 15.

Moreover as illustrated with respect to the user interface may further comprise an enlarged map section wherein one or more of the maps and presented within the user interface may be enlarged for an improved enlarged view of the traffic patterns at the given selected time for example.

It will be appreciated that the personalization of maps displayed in a user interface may be based upon numerous factors such as those factors described above which may be taken into consideration when predicting future traffic for example. By way of example and not limitation information pertaining to a user s desired time of travel pertaining to a specified arrival time and or arrival timeframe e.g. where a user specifies the he she must arrive between 6 and 6 15 pm pertaining to other user specified parameters and or pertaining to weather considerations for example may affect the number of maps presented within a user interface and or the layout of such maps for example. By way of example if a user intention to arrive at the location between 6 and 6 15 pm is received the user interface may provide maps to the user that are incremented by 5 minutes e.g. a first map illustrates current traffic patterns a second map illustrates traffic patterns that are predicted in five minutes etc. . If a user intention to arrive at a location between 6 and 7 pm is received e.g. allowing greater flexibility in the arrival time maps that are incremented by 15 minutes may be presented in the user interface . As another example if a storm is predicted in the region at 7 pm the maps that are displayed in the user interface may represent predicted traffic patterns at increments before 7 pm when possible to assist the user in arriving at his her location before the 7 pm storm. It may be appreciated that other considerations may also be factored in when determining the increments of time between maps and or when determined times for forecasting traffic.

It will be appreciated that are merely intended to describe example interfaces for displaying two or more maps currently e.g. as thumbnails where at least one of the maps is based upon predicted future traffic patterns. For example instead of the maps being oriented in a horizontal row as illustrated in one or more of the maps may be oriented in a vertical column diagonal and or a checkerboard pattern for example. Moreover although the user interfaces illustrated in illustrate at least one map providing for current traffic patterns it will be appreciated that in another embodiment none of the displayed maps may illustrate current traffic patterns. By way of example a user may specify within the user interface a range of time and maps may be generated that illustrate future traffic patterns that fall within the specified range of time. Thus the user interface may be customizable based upon among other things the time of day when the maps are viewed weather consideration user parameters default parameters etc.
