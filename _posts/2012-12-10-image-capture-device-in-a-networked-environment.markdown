The present embodiments relate to imaging devices and in particular to methods and apparatus for the use of an image capture device in a networked environment.

Digital imaging capabilities have been integrated into a wide range of devices including digital cameras tablet computers and mobile phones. Digital imaging devices or image capture systems can refer to any device that can capture one or more digital images including devices that capture still images or videos. Such devices commonly employ flash lighting technologies for the purpose of illuminating target image scenes or subjects. Many digital imaging devices have an integral flash built in to the body of the device and some may be capable of controlling remote flash lighting devices.

The integration of digital processing technology with imaging devices has enabled more powerful and easier to use photographic products and has enabled devices to capture and enhance image data as well as connect to a network. For example digital imaging technology may be integrated into a mobile computing device such as a mobile phone laptop or tablet computer which also has wireless network connectivity and digital cameras may also be provided with wireless communication. Existing approaches implement target scene or subject lighting through control of built in or remote flash lighting devices. Such devices however lack the ability to sense and control existing lighting devices in the environment of the target image scene or subject.

In one embodiment lights proximate to the location of the camera may be selected to be dimmed or turned off for image capture and lights proximate to the subject may be selected to be turned on or made brighter based on the auto focus lens position of the camera. Certain embodiments may use in calculating the lighting parameters a key light which is a light close to the subject preferably in front of the subject and aimed directionally toward the subject as well as a fill light or plurality of fill lights which may be used to fill in shadows in the background. Some embodiments may not use all the lights in the room and may turn off some lights.

A preview may be displayed to the camera user of the subject with the calculated lighting parameters and additional previews may be presented for the same subject with alternate lighting parameters. For example alternate lighting parameters may be professional light with key and fill mood lighting full lighting dim lighting etc.

The user may select one set of lighting parameters from the preview. The camera may connect to the light bulbs via the integrated wireless network and adjust the parameters according to the user selection. In one embodiment the lighting is adjusted only temporarily for the duration of image capture for example as a flash. In another embodiment the calculated lighting parameters may be sustained for a longer time such as the duration of video capture. The techniques described herein provide the benefit of conserving camera battery through nonuse of the camera flash as well as providing more refined subject lighting as compared to a single point flash.

Embodiments of image lighting systems described herein employ a wireless network within an environment to access and control lighting devices already existing in the environment to illuminate a target image scene or subject. For example when capturing an image in a home or other building there may be a number of different lights present which create a local lighting environment affecting the photographic subject. Embodiments of digital imaging devices disclosed herein may use a wireless network within the home or building to access a variety of characteristics of the lights near the subject such as the location and brightness of the lights and may further use the wireless network to adjust the local lighting environment as desired to capture the image of the subject.

Recent developments in the application of wireless technology have enabled the networking and control of systems and devices within an indoor setting. For example within a home there may be numerous electrical systems e.g. light switches televisions radios etc. mechanical systems e.g. windows doors door locks etc. communication systems e.g. a security system a local area network LAN etc. and entertainment systems e.g. televisions home theater systems etc. and a connected home may enable centralized control of all of these systems.

In a connected home an integrated wireless network such as the AllJoin proximity based peer to peer P2P system Qualcomm Innovation Center Inc San Diego Calif. connects appliances and devices to an interface which can provide information regarding the appliances and devices to each other and or a user. This information may be transmitted to a camera or other image capture device as described herein. In some embodiments the camera may be included in a smart phone device which is used to monitor and control the appliances and devices in the home.

The light bulbs of the home or of certain rooms within the home may be capable of wireless connection to the digital imaging device for instance by using a P2P system. When the digital imaging device enters any connected room the digital imaging device may connect to the light bulbs inside the room and obtain data regarding a variety of parameters of those connected light bulbs. The light bulbs may transmit data representing these parameters for example the type of bulb employed the location of the light source the direction of the light source and the brightness and flash capability of the bulb to the digital imaging device.

When the digital imaging device is focused on a subject to capture an image of the subject the digital imaging device may calculate lighting parameters that would produce a high quality image. The camera may include in this calculation data representing the parameters of any light bulbs in the room such as location flash capability and brightness capability and may relate the location of the light bulbs to the location of the digital imaging device and or the subject. The location of the subject may be determined by a variety of methods for example by the auto focus lens position of the digital imaging device to calculate an approximate distance of the subject from the digital imaging device. The direction the camera is facing may also be used to calculate the location of the subject. If the subject moves the lens in the digital imaging device may track the moving subject and determine new subject location data. The calculated lighting parameters may be dynamically adjusted based on the new location data.

Embodiments of an image capture device in a network environment described herein provide for an image capture device that may be configured to connect to and adjust the settings of illumination devices in order to create better images. The image capture device may contain a built in flash but may also be configured to adjust or control any connected lights in order to create optimal lighting settings for a photograph. This may allow the image capture device to create better photographs and also have better battery life due to decreased use of the flash.

In one embodiment the image capture device may allow a user to manually control the lights to create optimal lighting settings or may include an automatic mode where the image capture device may control nearby connected lights in order to create better photographs or videos.

In another embodiment the image capture device may be able to control lights in order to reduce the amount of glare. In this embodiment the system would sense which lights were backlighting the subject or causing glare to form on the image sensor and then adjust the luminance of that light to reduce the amount of glare.

Another embodiment of the system is an image capture device that reads the type of each light in the room through the wireless network and then controls the lights based on the type of light. For example some lights such as florescent lights take longer to turn on than incandescent lights. Thus the camera communicates with the lights in the room to first determine based on the position of the subject that light A will be the key light light B will be the fill light and light C will be the backlight. However depending on the type of light the system will need to turn them on at different times so that when the camera shutter opens each light is properly illuminated and has the right brightness.

Still another embodiment is a system that can adjust the lighting in the room to ensure that the lights have the proper color temperature for the image capture device. As is known different types of lights have different color temperatures i.e. brightness and color casts. Some lights have a blueish tint while others give off a more yellow light. One aspect of the invention is to properly illuminate specific lights in the room so that the subject is illuminated with the same color temperature. That minimizes the auto white balance phase of the camera pipeline and makes the images appear more natural.

One skilled in the art will recognize that these embodiments may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. Those of skill in the art will understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example data instructions commands information signals bits symbols and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages currents electromagnetic waves magnetic fields or particles optical fields or particles or any combination thereof.

In the following description specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the examples. However it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the examples may be practiced without these specific details. For example electrical components devices may be shown in block diagrams in order not to obscure the examples in unnecessary detail. In other instances such components other structures and techniques may be shown in detail to further explain the examples.

It is also noted that the examples may be described as a process which is depicted as a flowchart a flow diagram a finite state diagram a structure diagram or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently and the process can be repeated. In addition the order of the operations may be re arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed. A process may correspond to a method a function a procedure a subroutine a subprogram etc. When a process corresponds to a software function its termination corresponds to a return of the function to the calling function or the main function.

Referring now to an exemplary image capture device with wireless lighting control will now be described in greater detail. As shown in an image capture device includes a display which may show a preview of an image to be captured. The image to be captured may include a subject and may also include a first floor lamp a ceiling light and a second floor lamp . On the display the illumination devices such the first floor lamp may be numbered by an illumination device number . An illumination device number may be beneficial in order to allow a user to manually control parameters of an illumination device.

Although the image capture device shown is a digital camera it will be understood by those skilled in the art that this is for purposes of illustration only and that the display may be employed in a variety of image capture devices such as a video recorder a web camera a camera built into a portable or mobile computer including but not limited to a cellular telephone smart phone portable media player personal digital assistant a laptop or a tablet computer. Image capture device may be a digital camera such as a digital video camera a digital still image camera or a combination of both. Image capture device may be a stand alone device such as a stand alone camera or be integrated in another multi purpose device such as a wireless communication device. For example image capture device may be a cell phone or other wireless communication device.

Image capture device may include a networking module configured to access one or more wireless networks such as a wireless local area network WLAN or a wireless wide area network WWAN . In some embodiments the networking module may be configured to connect to proximity based P2P wireless networks and or ad hoc wireless networks. One or more of these networks may make up a connected home. Such a connected home may use an integrated wireless network such as the AllJoin proximity based P2P system Qualcomm Innovation Center Inc which can connect appliances and devices to an interface which can provide information regarding the appliances and devices to each other and or a user. These one or more wireless networks may be used to provide image capture device with information regarding one of more illumination devices in a location. For example image capture device may be configured to access a wireless network which contains information on one or more illumination devices within a home office or other location. Information on illumination devices may include the location brightness type of light bulb and possible adjustment settings for an illumination device. For example parameters of an illumination device may include the device s location its color the type of bulb its brightness for example in lumens and the extent to which its brightness may be adjusted for example whether it can be adjusted to one of 100 brightness settings or if the light can merely be turned on and off. The image capture device may also be configured to control the one or more illumination devices. For example the image capture device may be configured to turn on or off the one or more illumination devices and may be configured to adjust the brightness of illumination devices which may have adjustable brightness levels.

Image capture device may be configured to recognize and identify illumination devices which are positioned such that they may be in an image to be captured. For example image capture device may be configured to identify and number illumination devices which are displayed on the display . Image capture device may also be configured to recognize and identify other nearby illumination devices which may not be contained within an image but whose light may potentially at least partially illuminate an image. For example image capture device may be configured to recognize the direction it is pointing and to identify illumination devices which may be above behind or in front of the subject . Image capture device may include an image sensor and may be configured to recognize illumination devices contained within an image or illumination devices which may affect an image whether the illumination devices are currently turned on or turned off.

The network may be connected to a networked environment . In some embodiments the networked environment may represent a physical location and may include one or more devices contained within the physical location. For example the networked environment may represent a connected home in which a number of devices within the home are connected to the networked environment . The networked environment may include an environment networking module . The environment networking module may contain access restriction features to ensure that only authorized users may access and control the devices and systems contained within the networked environment . This environment networking module may be connected to a device and systems control module . The device and systems control module may allow control of a variety of devices and systems which are a part of the networked environment . For example the device and systems control module may allow user systems to connect to the network and to control various devices and systems contained within the networking environment .

The devices and systems of the networked environment may include any number of devices and systems which may be present. The networked environment may include a connected home environment. A connected home may enable centralized control of a number of systems within a home including numerous electrical systems e.g. light switches televisions radios etc. mechanical systems e.g. windows doors door locks etc. communication systems e.g. a security system a local area network LAN etc. and entertainment systems e.g. televisions home theater systems etc. and a connected home may enable centralized control of all of these systems.

The networked environment may also include environment device data store . The environment device data store may store data relating to the devices and systems contained within the networked environment . For example the environment device data store may contain information about the environment lighting components within the networked environment . This information may include for example the number of environment lighting components their type of bulb their brightness their possible configurations and settings and their locations. The information about the devices and systems within the networked environment may be available to user systems connected to the network and authorized by the environment networking module . This information may be used in order to allow a user system such as an image capture device to adjust and control devices and systems such as environment lighting components .

Image capture device may recognize the direction it is pointing using various technologies. For example image capture device may contain a directional guidance system which can include a GPS receiver an accelerometer a gyroscope and or a digital compass. The image capture device may use one of more of these devices alone or in concert with other technologies to assist in determining what direction it is point and which illumination devices may affect an image. Image capture device may also recognize the direction is it pointing based at least in part upon information received from an image sensor and or other sensors on the device. For example image capture device may be configured to analyze a preview image such as that shown on display and use this information at least in part to recognize and identify illumination devices which may be contained within the image or which may affect the image. Image capture device may also recognize the distance to a subject based at least in part upon the focus of an auto focus lens on image capture device . The distance of the subject may be used at least in part to determine which illumination devices if any may affect the lighting in an image.

The image capture device may also include a memory for storing executable software or firmware instructions and modules. Modules within the memory may be executed by the processor using the working memory and the data store . The memory may be configured to access image data or image data streams from the imaging sensor and may be configured to output information to the data store and or a display . The display may be a touch activated display wherein the user can control features of the software user interface using touch gestures.

Memory may contain a number of individual software modules. In some embodiments software module may include an imaging sensor control module . This module may be configured to control and operate the imaging sensor. For example the imaging sensor control module may be configured to control lenses and other systems on the imaging sensor in order to allow the imaging sensor to function and to properly be able to obtain images.

Memory may further contain a network interface module . This network interface module may be configured to allow the image capture device to connect to one or more networks such as wireless P2P networks WLANs WWANs and or other networks. The network interface module may be configured to transmit information to and from these networks including information related to the control of illumination devices which may be connected to the one or more networks that the network interface module may be connected to.

Memory may further contain a lighting calculation module . The lighting calculation module may be configured to receive image information from the imaging sensor and to calculate optimal lighting settings for the image. The lighting calculation module may base these calculations on a number of factors such as user configurable settings information about illumination devices available on networks that the network interface module is connected to information about the location of the subject from the imaging sensor and or the imaging sensor control module and other factors. The lighting calculation module may use any of these factors or others to calculate optimal lighting settings for an image. The lighting calculation module may also be configured to communicate through the network interface module in order to control illumination devices on the network in order to create optimal lighting settings for an image. In some embodiments lighting calculation module may also be configured to generate a preview image illustrating what an image may look like after lighting has been changed to its optimal settings.

Memory may further include a capture control module . Capture control module may be configured to control the capture of images from imaging sensor . Capture control module may also be configured to coordinate the activities of imaging sensor control module in focusing the lenses and other imaging sensor functions and lighting calculation module in order to ensure than optimal lighting settings are calculated and created in time for an image to be captured. Capture control module may be configured to support either single still image capture multiple image captures or video capture. Capture control module may be configured to use the processor and working memory to convert raw image data or raw image data streams from the imaging sensor into a useful form in order to store captures images or videos on the data store .

The capture control module can also be configured to automatically or manually control the lighting features attached to the device . In some embodiments image capture device may allow a user to choose whether to manually or automatically control illumination devices. In a manual mode a user may be able to control each light at once to control groups of lights such as similar lights at once or to control each light individually. The image capture device may also contain the lighting calculation module which may be configured to calculate optimal lighting settings. This module may be used in a manual mode to make suggestions to a user on lighting settings. A user may then use modify or discard these suggestions according to the user s preferences.

Image capture device may be configured to have an automatic lighting mode. Image capture device may include a calculation module using data generated from the lighting calculation module and configured to calculate optimal lighting settings. In an automatic lighting mode image capture device may automatically control illumination devices which may affect an image according to calculated optimal lighting settings. For example image capture device may determine where a subject is and may determine which illumination devices may be above or near the subject. Image capture device may include a control module configured to selectively turn on or off lights or adjust the brightness of lights in order to create a more attractive image.

For example image capture device may turn on a key light on the subject perhaps in front of the subject and a fill light in order to fill in the shadows in the background. However image capture device may choose not to turn on all lights in the area as this may create an unpleasant uniformity of light or may not turn on the light directly above the subject as this may create undesirable hard shadows on the subject. Image capture device may have a plurality of settings for controlling the lighting in its automatic mode. For example a user may indicate that he or she prefers more or less lighting of the subject or of the background or harder or softer lighting and may adjust settings to accommodate this preference. The image capture device may be configured to adjust the lights automatically in real time as the device is directed at various subjects or may be configured to adjust lighting only when a shutter or other mechanism on the image capture device is activated. In some embodiments the image capture device may capture video images rather than still images. In this embodiment it may be beneficial to adjust lighting settings on a continuous or semi continuous basis.

In some embodiments the image capture device may contain a built in flash . This built in flash may be used in when there is insufficient illumination for a photograph even after connecting to nearby illumination devices. For example if there are no nearby illumination devices connected to the network the image capture device may use a built in flash in the conventional manner. However if there are nearby connected illumination devices and in sufficient number to create optimal lighting settings the image capture device may refrain from using its built in flash to illuminate an image. This may enable the image capture device to achieve substantially better battery life and lower power consumption as a built in flash may consume a large amount of power from a battery. The control of connected illumination devices may also allow the image capture device to create significantly better photographs than the use of a conventional flash as the illumination devices when configured optimally may create much more desirable lighting conditions for photography. The use of connected illumination devices rather than a flash may also reduce the number of times that a human subject may blink in a photograph or reduce the incidence of the red eye effect in a photograph.

The display of image capture device may be configured to show a preview image. This preview image may be an image of what the area looks with the current lighting or may be a preview image of what the image would look like with certain adjustments to the light sources within the area. For example the image capture device may determine ideal lighting settings in an automated mode and may preview what these lighting settings would look like on the display . This may allow a user to view what an image with optimized light settings would look like without requiring that the illumination devices in the area be adjusted by the control module of the image capture device .

Memory may further include an operating system . This operating system may provide a number of features such as providing a system on which other software modules may operate and providing an interface to a user. Operating system may be configured to provide an application programming interface API to other software modules in order to enable other software modules to use the various physical components of the image capture device . For example the operating system may provide a number of commands and features by which other software modules may communicate with the imaging sensor data store display and other components of the image capture device .

The process begins at step where the image capture device establishes a connection to a connected home network. A connected home network may use any number of possible networking technologies. For example a connected home network may use a P2P wireless networking technology. A connected home network may contain any number of devices including lights and or other illumination devices. One embodiment of a connected home network may include the network and networked environment of .

The process continues at step where a user of an image capture device initiates an image capture process in a room of the connected home. This may occur for example when a user pushes a button or control on the image capture device to initiate taking a picture. When this occurs the process will continue to step where the image capture device will determine whether there are connected lights in the room. The image capture device may be configured to determine its own location in a number of ways as described above. Based upon this information and information about nearby lights attached to the connected network the image capture device may determine whether there are nearby connected lights.

If the process determines that there are no lights connected to the connected home network in the room the process will continue at step where the image capture device may perform the image capture process with built in device flash as no connected lights are available for illumination.

If the process determines that there are connected lights in the room the process will continue to step where it will obtain data representing light parameters and current settings. For example connected lights in a room may be available on a network and the network may also contain information regarding the connected lights. This information may include parameters of the connected lights including their location brightness type of light bulb current settings and possible gradations of brightness. The image capture device may obtain this data from each connected light within some proximity of the subject such as subject of .

The process continues at step where the image capture device may present a user with an option to manually or automatically adjust lights. This option may be presented to a user each time he or she wishes to take a photo may be presented to a user upon entering a connected home or may be presented to a user once and the image capture device may be configured to remember a user s selection.

If the user selects manual mode the process continues at step where the image capture device presents the user with an interface for adjusting parameters of the lights. For example this interface may allow users to adjust the brightness of individual lights turn lights on and off and other parameters in order to create an optimal image. In some embodiments the image capture device may make these changes to the light settings in real time. In some embodiments the image capture device may display a preview image previewing what the subject would look like with the selected image settings.

When a user has finished manually changing the settings of connected lights in the room the process continues at step where the image capture device adjusts the current light settings to match user input. The image capture device may adjust current light settings using a network connection to the lights in the connected home as detailed above.

If the user selects the automatic mode after step the process continues to step where the image capture device may calculate desired lighting parameters. The image capture device may include a lighting calculation module as in which may be configured to calculate the optimal lighting settings. This module may be used to calculate desired lighting parameters based at least in part on the location of the subject ambient light available the angle of the image capture device the connected lights in the room user selected preferences or other factors.

The process continues to step where the image capture device may adjust the current light settings to match desired lighting parameters. The image capture device may adjust current light settings using a network connection to the lights in the connected home as detailed above.

Finally the process continues after either step or step to step and captures an image. This image may be stored on a local storage such as the data store in or may be stored or transmitted to another device over a network.

The process begins at step where the user initiates an image capture of a subject in a connected home room. For example the user may be using a image capture device to take a photograph of a subject as in .

The process continues at step where the image capture device retrieves data representing parameters and current settings of lights in the room. These parameters may include the number of lights in a room their locations brightness type of bulb or other parameters. These parameters may be retrieved directly from the connected lights in the room using a P2P networking.

The process continues at step to determine the location of the user device. The user device which may be an image capture device may be located using a number of methods as detailed above including by using an imaging sensor on the image capture device .

The process continues at step by determining the location of the subject relative to the user device. In some embodiments the location of the subject may be determined based at least in part on the auto focus lens settings of the user device. For example if the lens is currently in macro mode the subject may be nearby while if the lens is in an infinite range focus mode the subject may be ten or more feet away.

The process continues at step by determining the location of room lights relative to the subject and to the user device. This determination may be based at least in part upon the location of the lights the location of the user device and the distance between the user device and the subject.

The process continues at step by analyzing the current lighting of the subject. This analysis may be based at least in part by analyzing data received from imaging sensors on the image capture device . The data received from imaging sensors may be analyze to determine whether the subject and or the background is too bright or washed out too dark or contains hard shadows which may be undesirable. The data received from imaging sensors may also be analyzed to determine what the subject is. For example it may be preferable to have different lighting settings for a photograph of a person as opposed to a photograph of an inanimate object.

Finally the process concludes at step by calculating the parameter settings of room lights which would produce the desired lighting of the subject. This calculation may be based at least in part on the current lighting of the subject the location of the subject the location of room lights and the location of the user device.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should typically be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers typically means at least two recitations or two or more recitations .

Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . In those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B or C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B or C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms whether in the description claims or drawings should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms either of the terms or both terms. For example the phrase A or B will be understood to include the possibilities of A or B or A and B.
