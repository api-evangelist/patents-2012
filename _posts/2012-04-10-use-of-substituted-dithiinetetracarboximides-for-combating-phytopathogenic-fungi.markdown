The present invention relates to the use of substituted dithiine tetracarboximides and the N oxides and the salts thereof for combating phytopathogenic fungi and to seeds coated with at least one such compound. The invention also relates to novel dithiine tetracarboximides processes for preparing these compounds and to compositions comprising at least one such compound.

The use of certain substituted dithiine tetracarboximides for controlling phytopathogenic fungi is known from WO 2010 043319 and 2011 029551.

The compounds according to the present invention differ from those described in the abovemention publications by the specific substituent Rthat is bound to the nitrogen atom of at least one of the imide moieties.

In many cases in particular at low application rates the fungicidal activity of the known fungicidal compounds is unsatisfactory. Based on this it was an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity and or a broader activity spectrum against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

This object is achieved by the use of certain substituted dithiine tetracarboximides having good fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

Further the preparation of certain substituted dithiine tetracarboximides inter alia 2 6 diallyl 1 4 dithiino 2 3 c 5 6 c dipyrrole 1 3 5 7 tetraone is mentioned in J. Heterocyclic Chem. 2010 47 188 193 U.S. Pat. No. 3 364 229 and Revue Roumaine de Chemie 2005.

The compounds according to the present invention differ from those described in J. Heterocyclic Chem. 2010 47 188 193 by the proviso that 2 6 diallyl 1 4 dithiino 2 3 c 5 6 c dipyrrole 1 3 5 7 tetraone is being excluded.

Therefore according to a second aspect the invention provides compounds of formula I which are represented by formula I

The term compounds I refers to compounds of formula I. Likewise this terminology applies to all sub formulae e.g. compounds I.2 refers to compounds of formula I.2 or compounds V refers to compounds of formula V etc.

The compounds I can be obtained by various routes in analogy to prior art processes known cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3 364 229 Synthetic Commun. 36 2006 3591 3597 J. Heterocyclic Chem. 47 2010 188 193 and II Farmaco 60 2005 944 947 and advantageously by the synthesis shown in the following schemes and in the experimental part of this application.

In a first process for example cf. II Farmaco 60 2005 944 947 succinic anhydride II is reacted in a first step with an amine III if appropriate in the presence of a diluent. Thereafter the resulting succinic monoamides IV are then reacted with a sulfur source e.g. thionyl chloride . Depending on the reaction conditions the dithiine diisoimides V can be isolated before they are converted into compounds I wherein X is O and k is 0 which are of formula I.A1. If appropriate the resulting compounds I.A1 can subsequently be oxidized e.g. with nitric acid to form compounds I wherein k is 1 which are of formula I.A2. The preparation of compounds I can be illustrated by the following scheme in which R is Ror R 

In a second process for example cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3 364 229 Synthetic Commun. 36 2006 3591 3597 and Revue Roumaine de Chimie 50 2005 601 607 dichloromaleic anhydride VI is reacted in a first step with an amine III if appropriate in the presence of a diluent. Thereafter the resulting maleic imides VII are then reacted with a sulfur source e.g. hydrogen disulfide sodium or barium trithiocarbanate sodium sulfide nonahydrate sodium thiosulfate or thiourea . If appropriate the resulting dithiine tetracarboximides I.A1 can subsequently be oxidized with nitric acid. The preparation of the dithiine tetracarboximides can be illustrated by the following scheme in which R is Ror R 

In a third process for example cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3 364 229 dichloromaleimide VII wherein R is hydrogen is prepared by photochlorination of succinimide VIII if appropriate in the presence of UV light and at temperatures between 50 and 250 C. Thereafter the hydrogen of the NH moiety of the resulting dicholoromaleimide can be readily replaced using standard conditions by R wherein R is Ror Ras defined herein to obtain compounds VII. Likewise the dichloromaleimide may directly be reacted with a sulfur source e.g. hydrogen disulfide barium trithiocarbonate or thiourea to obtain unsubstituted 1 4 dithiin 2 3 5 6 tetracarboxylic acid diimide of formula IX. Thereafter the hydrogen of both NH moieties of the resulting compound IX can be readily replaced using standard conditions by R wherein R is Ror Ras defined herein to obtain compounds I.A1. The preparation of the dithiine tetracarboximides can be illustrated by the following scheme 

In a fourth process for example cf. Chem. Ber. 100 1967 1559 1570 compound IX may be reacted at temperatures of from 20 C. to 150 C. preferably in the presence of a base and a diluent to yield 1 4 dithiine carboxylic acid compound X. After neutralization with an acid this compound X is reacted in the presence of an acid and or a water scavenger for example with acetanhydride p toluene sulfonic acid sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid or acetic acid if appropriate in the presence of a diluent at temperatures of from 20 C. to 150 C. Thereafter the resulting 1 4 dithiine tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride XI is then reacted with an amine III to obtain isomeric mixtures of compounds XII. Thereafter compounds XII can be dehydrated in the presence of an acid and or a water scavenger for example with acetanhydride p toluene sulfonic acid sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid acetic acid thionylchlorid ohospohorous oxychloride or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to obtain compounds I.1. The preparation of the dithiine tetracarboximides can be illustrated by the following scheme 

Compounds I V and XII wherein Ris not identical to R may be obtained by using intermediates with different R substituents in the respective synthesis steps. Mixtures of such compounds wherein Ris not identical to R can be used as such or can be separated if required.

If individual compounds I cannot be obtained by the routes described above they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.

The N oxides may be prepared from the compounds I according to conventional oxidation methods e.g. by treating compounds I with an organic peracid such as meta chloroperbenzoic acid cf. WO 03 64572 or J. Med. Chem. 38 11 1892 903 1995 or with inorganic oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide cf. J. Heterocyc. Chem. 18 7 1305 8 1981 or oxone cf. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123 25 5962 5973 2001 . The oxidation may lead to pure mono N oxides or to a mixture of different N oxides which can be separated by conventional methods such as chromatography.

If the synthesis yields mixtures of isomers a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be interconverted during work up for use or during application e.g. under the action of light acids or bases . Such conversions may also take place after use e.g. in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus to be controlled.

Aqueous application forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates pastes or wettable powders sprayable powders oil dispersions by adding water. To prepare emulsions pastes or oil dispersions the substances as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter tackifier dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance wetter tackifier dispersant or emulsifier and if appropriate solvent or oil and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.

The active substance concentrations in the ready to use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general they are from 0.0001 to 10 preferably from 0.001 to 1 by weight of active substance.

The active substances may also be used successfully in the ultra low volume process ULV it being possible to apply compositions comprising over 95 by weight of active substance or even to apply the active substance without additives.
