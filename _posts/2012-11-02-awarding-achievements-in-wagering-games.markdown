Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly award achievements in wagering games.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.

This description of the embodiments is divided into six sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example embodiments while the fifth section describes additional example operating environments. The sixth section presents some general comments.

Wagering games are expanding in popularity. Wagering game enthusiasts expect continuous innovations to the wagering game experience. As stated previously wagering game companies are interested in creating and providing innovate wagering games and gaming features to the demanding public. Some embodiments of the present subject matter describe examples of awarding achievements in wagering games. Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network e.g. public or private that provides access to wagering games such as a website e.g. via wide area networks or WANs a private gaming network e.g. local area networks or LANs a file sharing networks a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. .

In some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling .

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments. Further as mentioned above an award ladder game may be associated with secondary content that is associated with e.g. monitors interacts with etc. primary content. Consequently herein an award ladder game may also be referred to as a secondary game. Secondary in some embodiments can refer to an application s importance or priority of the data. In some embodiments secondary can refer to a distinction or separation from a primary application e.g. separate application files separate content separate states separate functions separate processes separate programming sources separate processor threads separate data separate control separate domains etc. . For example a primary game can be a wagering game primary wagering game played by a player account. The player account places wagers on the primary wagering game. The primary wagering game has pay tables that list payable outcome configurations e.g. certain winning combinations arrangements or configurations of playing elements that payout on bets if the random outcome configuration of the primary wagering game matches one of the payable outcome configurations listed in the pay table. The primary wagering game can also have non payable activity events outcome configurations e.g. non winning combination of playing elements etc. The award ladder game can be a secondary game that watches the activity of the primary wagering game for the occurrence of a pre determined set of payable or non payable activity events etc. in the primary wagering game. Further even though primary games and secondary games may be referred to as being separate applications in some embodiments secondary content and control can be passed between applications e.g. via application programming interfaces thus becoming or falling under the control of primary content or primary applications and vice versa. Further in some embodiments secondary games can be developed into primary games as an integrated single application.

This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a wagering game server configured to control wagering game content provide random numbers and communicate wagering game information account information and other information to and from a client . The wagering game server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the client . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the client . The content controller can communicate the game results to the client . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the client so that the client can generate game results. The wagering game server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The wagering game server can also include an account manager configured to control information related to player accounts. For example the account manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server . The wagering game server can also include a communication unit configured to communicate information to the client and to communicate with other systems devices and networks. The wagering game server can also include a secondary game configuration module configured to configure secondary games to utilize subsets of possible wagering game activity or events e.g. potential slot reel combinations potential card hands potential roulette outcomes consecutive game outcomes for a player account etc. as achievements for a secondary game. The secondary game configuration module can also generate award ladders and correlate award ladders to the wagering game activity. The wagering game server can also include a secondary game controller configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content available on a wagering game network e.g. secondary game content promotions content advertising content player tracking content web content etc. . The secondary game controller can track player account registrations for secondary games determine player account activity in primary wagering games and in some cases activity in other secondary games and pay out awards according to an award ladder for an award ladder game based on the player account activity.

The wagering game system architecture can also include the client configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to award achievements in wagering games. The client can be a computer system a personal digital assistant PDA a cell phone a laptop a wagering game machine or any other device or machine that is capable of processing information instructions or other data provided via a communications network . The client can include a content controller configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the client . The client can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The client can also include a processor configured to process wagering game content present online wagering game objects control gaming devices etc. The client can also include a wagering game module configured to control activities for primary and secondary applications determine occurrence of activity or events during gaming applications and provide awards for matching achievements associated with award ladders e.g. provide awards in a stair step ladder process provide next sequential awards etc . The wagering game module can also be configured to control data associated with group games such as group game activity group game statistics tracking virtual assets for group games etc.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a web server configured to control and present an online website that hosts wagering games. The web server can also be configured to present primary and secondary applications including award ladder games. The web server can also be configured to present and control group game progress reports player account information award redemption features virtual economy information etc.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a community game server configured to provide and control content for community games including networked games social games competitive games or any other game that multiple players can participate in at the same time. Some community games can include group scavenger hunt games.

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via the communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the wagering game server can also be configured to perform functions of the community game server the web server the account server the wagering game module and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account manager and the communication unit can be included in the client instead of or in addition to being a part of the wagering game server . Further in some embodiments the client can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the wagering game server .

As mentioned previously in some embodiments the client can take the form of a wagering game machine. Examples of wagering game machines can include floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments clients and wagering game servers work together such that clients can be operated as a thin thick or intermediate clients. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the client can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to a user e.g. player . In a thick client example the clients can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the client . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the wagering game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable media includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a wagering game machine computer etc. . For example tangible machine readable media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory machines etc. Machine readable media also includes any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a subset of events from the plurality of possible events. The system can generate a game event list from the subset of game events. The game event list includes a listing of the events from the subset subset events which the award ladder game can use as awardable or eligible achievements for the award ladder game. The subset event listing may be referred to as an eligible achievements list or a subset events list. For example in the award ladder game includes the eligible achievement list . The eligible achievement list includes the possible events e.g. the eligible poker hand combinations for the video poker game . Returning to the system can also determine corresponding odds for the subset of game events on the eligible achievements list and create an odds list. The odds list can present corresponding odds so that players can know the odds of possibly achieving one of the awardable events on the eligible achievements list. For example in the achievement list can include a frequency list which displays odds or frequency of occurrences of the events listed in the eligible achievement list . Returning to in some embodiments the system can create an achieved event list for the subset game events to track whether the events on the eligible achievement list have been achieved for the award ladder game. For example in the achievement list includes an availability list which indicates both events that have already been achieved e.g. via an x indicator and events that have not been achieved e.g. indicated by a YES indicator or that are still available for achievement. The availability list is only one example of an achieved event list. For instance in some embodiments an achieved event list can utilize different types of indicators. In other embodiments the achieved event list can be integrated with the eligible achievement list such as by crossing out or removing non eligible items or events listed in the eligible achievement list after the events have been achieved.

The flow continues at processing block where the system generates an award ladder. The award ladder can include a listing of a plurality of awards. The number of awards can correlate with the number of subset game events in the achievement list. The award number can correlate exactly proportionality or some other way e.g. one to one correlation one to two meaning that and an event can occur twice and an award is provided each of the two times that event occurs etc. . In some embodiments the system can provide monetary or non monetary awards. In some embodiments the system can determine player preferences regarding types of awards to be included on an embodiment of an award ladder that adjusts award listings based on player preferences. For instance in a player account can specify award preferences that indicate types of awards or award classifications. In a wagering game system system includes a computer connected to an account server via a communications network . A web server can also be connected to the communications network . The account server can store the player account . A player can access the player account via the computer . In some embodiments the web server can host a website that provides access through which a player can log on to the player account using the computer . In other embodiments a player can access the player account via a wagering game machine or other device e.g. a cell phone a personal digital assistant etc. that can access the communications network . For instance referring momentarily to a player can access the player account by activating a secondary game report control . Upon activating the secondary game report control the wagering game machine can present the player account . Returning to the player account can include various settings that relate to wagering games award ladder games and other secondary games. For example the player account can include an account balance indicator that indicates a financial balance that the player account utilizes during wagering games from which to make bets and to store gambling winnings. The player account can also include the award preferences . The award preferences can include selection controls for selecting types of awards that a player account would prefer and which the system can use to provide an award ladder. The player account can also include a secondary game report console to indicate awards won via award ladder games and other secondary games. For example the secondary game report console indicates a report of an award in . For instance referring momentarily to the five spade flush was an event that won a next sequential award on the award ladder . However returning to the secondary game report console reports that the five spade flush event was also an event for a scavenger hunt game e.g. the Star Trek Scavenger Hunt Game . The secondary game report console also indicates other information for the award such as the date that the award was made and a division of the award. In some embodiments the system can divide awards received from award ladder games. The player account can include award division settings where teams or groups agree to split awards. The award division settings can specify an agreement of multiple players to divide possession rights for awards earned by player accounts in some wagering games or secondary type games. The player account can include team settings used to indicate teams or groups. The player account can also include settings related to different ways of presenting odds on an achievement list as mathematical odds versus customized textual description of odds e.g. odds of getting struck by lightning odds of getting in a car accident in Los Angeles after midnight odds of being selected for jury duty etc. . The player account can also include social contact settings which a player can use to specify account information contact information personal information avatars etc. for friends or acquaintances associated with the player account .

The flow continues at processing block where the system orders a plurality of awards on the award ladder in an order of value. In some embodiments the system can order the awards in a sequential order e.g. ascending or descending of values. For example the system can order the award values starting with the lowest valued award one end of the award list e.g. the bottom of the award list and the award values can follow an escalating order of values to the highest award value. In some embodiments where the awards are non monetary the system can order the awards in a perceived order of value e.g. closest approximate market value for the award a virtual economy value etc. . In some embodiments where the system has no reference for a value the system can provide options for players to select an award e.g. directly select select from a grab bag etc. or can randomly assign awards. In some embodiments the system can order the awards according to preferences for the player such as by settings for the player account that indicate how much personal value a non monetary award has to the player account. For example in the award preferences can include ranking controls that a player can use to rate or rank award preferences. The system can use the rankings to determine how much a player values a non monetary type of award based on numerical values specified in the rankings.

The flow continues at processing block where the system configures the award ladder to award the plurality of awards in sequential order of value in an order of occurrence of the subset of events. In some embodiments the system can configure an award list to indicate a next sequential award that is still eligible to be awarded such as an award that has not been awarded yet but is the next sequential award on the award list. For example in the award ladder can include the award list showing that the 60 award is next in sequence of awards that have not been awarded yet. The award ladder can includes an award achievement indicator that specifies which awards have already been awarded and which awards are yet to be awarded. The presentation of the award list and the award achievement indicator indicate to a player what the next award will be. The award ladder can also include a next award indicator to specifically point out that the 60 award is next is sequence of unawarded awards and will be awarded when the next available event is achieved from the achievement list . The award ladder game can award the next sequential award regardless of any criteria other than being first in time to achieve the event e.g. regardless of the achieved game event properties player account properties betting amounts difficulty of an event payout amount associated with an event associated bet amounts by a player account player status duration of play etc. . For example occurrence rates of some game events can be different as indicated by the frequency list . Some events can have very low odds of occurrence some very high some in between e.g. a range of frequency of occurrences . However the award ladder game can still award the next sequential award on the awards list regardless of the odds or frequency of occurrence for any of the remaining eligible events. However in some embodiments the system can provide additional awards e.g. award multipliers entertainment points perks etc. based on the event properties player account properties or other factors. In some wagering games when an outcome has a lower probability of being achieved an award is generally higher. However with an award ladder the award amount on the award ladder can be completely independent from the likelihood and probability of the outcome. Returning now to in some embodiments the system can configure an award ladder to award prizes only for a first time that a subset game event occurs e.g. until the award ladder is reset so that every time a player account is the first to attain an achievement the player account receives the next highest award available on the award ladder. In other embodiments however the system can provide award ladder prizes multiple times. For instance in the award ladder can award the 60 prize and all other prizes twice instead of once. The achievement list can also maintain the achievements as eligible until they are attained twice. In some embodiments the number of awards in the award ladder can be different from the number of eligible events in the achievement list e.g. more awards than eligible events or more eligible events than awards . For instance if there are more awards than eligible events for example a two to one correlation the system can maintain each of the eligible events as eligible twice for awards during an award ladder game cycle. An award ladder cycle is the period during which the award ladder game awards all of its awards. When the award ladder game awards all of its awards then

The flow continues at processing block where the system configures the award ladder to reset when the plurality of awards have been awarded. In some embodiments a game controller can control the award ladder can track the progress of the awards and can determine when all of the plurality of awards has been awarded. The system can then reset the award ladder and begin awarding the awards in order of value e.g. from the lowest award value in ascending order . In some embodiments the system can increase or decrease the awards by a degree. In some embodiments the system can determine the degree of award values to use based on a progressive bonus account. The progressive bonus account can store an amount of money that has been held from previous games played by the player account or other player accounts and contributed to the progressive account to be used for bonus games rewards jackpots or other secondary type games. The system can determine wagering game machines that have been configured to present wagering games that use progressive accounts and configure award ladders on those wagering game machines to take into consideration the progressive account. For example a wagering game that features a secondary progressive game may require higher bets but may also entice players to play by offering higher award ladders than other games that do not utilize progressive accounts. In some embodiments the system can also utilize marketing funds or sponsorship funds to provide awards. For example the system can set the degree of awards based on prizes or money offered by a sponsor such as from a casino or a marketing partner e.g. from a casino that offers money from a marketing account from an online casino that offers entertainment points from a retailer that offers a shopping spree from an e tailer that offers a discount on merchandise from an online affiliate partner that offers a free subscription to a website etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines an award ladder associated with the award ladder game where the award ladder includes a plurality of awards in a sequential order of value. As described previously the award ladder is associated with a secondary game the award ladder game. Further the award ladder can include an award list that lists the plurality of awards in the sequential order of value. For example in the system can present an award ladder associated with the award ladder game . The award ladder can include an award list . The award list can include awards as mentioned above in a sequential order of value. The awards can be monetary and non monetary. In some embodiments the system can provide features for a player account to create a custom award ladder by selecting preferred award types and or providing personal awards that can be used in the award ladder game . For example the system can present an award type selector which the player account can use to select standard awards or customized awards. If the player account selects to play for customized awards the system can modify the awards listed in the award list to display awards that match player preferences for awards. For instance the system can read the award preferences see and then list and order the awards in the award list based on selected award types and selected preference rankings.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines playing activity for a player account on the one or more primary wagering games. For example in the player account can log in to a wagering game session to play the slot game . The system can monitor the activity that occurs during the slot game . Specifically the system determines combinations of slot reel configurations that appear on the reels e.g. along pay lines or off pay lines multiple elements or single elements etc. . The slot game can have hundreds or thousands of different combinations of slot reel configurations depending on the number of reel elements. However the system only presents a subset of those combinations for the award ladder game in the achievement list .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines an occurrence of at least one of the achievable events during the playing activity of the one or more primary wagering games. For example in the system determines whether any of the slot reel configurations that appear on the reels matches any of the listed events in the achievement list . For example in one embodiment one of the events e.g. reel element combinations listed in the achievement list includes the appearance of a reel friend game element . The reel friend game element may be an identifier of a social contact associated with the player account e.g. see the social contact settings in showing an avatar for the social contact Julie White which matches the appearance of the reel friend game element . The system thus determines that one of the events listed in the award list has occurred or in other words has been achieved. In some embodiments the slot game is configured to present reel elements configurations based on random wagering game results. However even though the appearance of the reel elements may be completely random for the slot game the award ladder game may refer to the select few events in the achievement list as achievements. In some embodiments however the slot game may be configured to have an element of skill that a player can utilize to achieve the events based on the player s skillful manipulation of game controls. Further in other embodiments other skill based wagering games can be presented instead of or in addition to the slot game .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines whether the achieved event is still eligible for an award. For example the system can have restrictions on the awards ability to provide awards for the same event. The system can prevent awards for an event that has already occurred more than once or any other specific number of times. For instance in the system can determine whether the any subsequent spin for the slot game has produced a reel friend element during the current game cycle for the award ladder game . If the award ladder game is configured to allow only one appearance of the reel friend element and the appearance of the reel friend game element is a second or subsequent appearance of a reel friend element then the system would determine that the appearance of the reel friend game element is not eligible for the next sequential award from the award list . Thus referring momentarily to the flow would return to the processing block to continue monitoring playing activity. On the other hand returning to if the appearance of the reel friend game element is the first appearance then the system determines that the event has not already happened during the award ladder game s current award cycle and thus determines that the appearance of the event is still eligible for an award on the award list . Thus referring again to the flow would continue at processing block .

The flow continues at the processing block where the system determines one eligible award on the award ladder that is next is sequence of the sequential order of value. The one eligible award may be referred to as the next sequential award. The one eligible award can be the lowest valued award on the award ladder that is still eligible for award e.g. that has not been awarded yet that can be awarded again if the secondary game allows multiple awarding of the same award value etc. . In some embodiments the value for the one award is independent of a frequency of occurrence during the primary wagering game activity. Thus the system can provide the award based on the timing of the triggering event not on the nature or properties of the event itself.

The flow continues at processing block where the system awards at least a portion of the one eligible award to the player account. For example in the system determines an ascending sequential order of value of unawarded awards on the award list . The system determines the lowest valued unawarded award on the award list in the ascending sequential order of value. The award ladder game can then award the player account the lowest valued ladder award that has not already been awarded. In some embodiments the system can award the entire award to the player account. In some embodiments the system can determine that the player account is associated with other player accounts that have agreed to share awards. For example the player account can be part of a team that competes in secondary games. The system can then divide the award amongst the group of player accounts for the team. In some embodiments the system can require an intermediate activity to receive the award. For example the award ladder game can require that the player account play a bonus type of game such as a picking game to obtain some or the entire award. The intermediate activity can also be related to game activity and options in the primary wagering game. For example illustrates an example of a grid of picking items picker grid that correlates with betting settings from the slot game in . In a wagering game system system includes the mobile wagering game machine mobile machine connected to a wagering game server via a communications network . The wagering game server can provide both primary and secondary content. The system can also include an account server and a web server also connected via the communications network . The mobile machine can present the picker grid in a display . The picker grid can include a number of picking items . The number of picking items can be related to betting settings e.g. betting amounts pay line settings etc. . For example the number of picking items can equal the maximum possible bet per line for the slot game . In another example the number of winning items in the picker grid can be equal to a player account s bet per line. Thus a player who is betting a maximum amount max betting can be guaranteed to win the prize incentivizing players to max bet. If the player picks a non winning item the system can still award the player with some portion of the award. In some embodiments the display can also present a message indicating that the occurrence of the reel friend game element in triggered a prize in another secondary game a group scavenger hunt game. A computer connected to the communications network can present a website in a web browser . The website can include prize information . The prize information can explain an item that was awarded as part of the group scavenger hunt game. The website can also include a depiction of an item .

The flow continues at processing block where the system indicates that the one eligible award has been awarded. The system can indicate on the award list that the award was awarded. For example as shown in the system can modify the award list to have the 1000 points prize crossed out. The system can also cross out the 1 Reel Friend achievement from the achievement list . Returning to the system can continue game play and award ladder awards can escalate until all players attain all of the predetermined achievements and the award ladder game has awarded all of its award. The system can then reset the events in the achievement list and reset the awards for another award ladder game cycle. The system can continue play over multiple gaming sessions and store the award ladder game on a wagering game machine associated with the award ladder game. In some embodiments the system can present the award ladder in online wagering game websites and other gaming venues.
