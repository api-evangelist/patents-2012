This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 482 496 filed May 4 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Described embodiments relate generally to vibration energy conversion devices and systems deriving electrical energy from such devices.

Over the past decade the ever decreasing power requirements of electronic devices has lead to considerable scientific interest in energy harvesting technologies. In particular there has been significant interest in the area of vibration energy harvesting VEH particularly for single degree of freedom SDOF piezoelectric and magnetic harvesters. Although there are a number of commercially available SDOF harvesters there exist a number of continuing challenges that prevent widespread application of VEH such as limited operational bandwidth and low power density. In many practical applications the direction of the incident vibration may vary so another challenge is the uni axial nature of many harvesters particularly cantilever based piezoelectric designs and SDOF electromagnetic designs.

In addition existing SDOF vibration energy harvesters generally are relatively heavy and or too large for some applications particularly those in aerospace fields. Existing SDOF harvesting devices can generally only take advantage of vibration of the host structure along a single axis. For host structures such as aircraft it may frequently be the case that the vibration energy associated with vibration of the host structure occurs across multiple axes.

It is desired to address or ameliorate one or more shortcomings or disadvantages associated with existing vibration energy conversion devices or to at least provide a useful alternative thereto.

at least one transducer element positioned to be affected by changes in a magnetic field of the magnet 

wherein movement of the object relative to the magnet varies the magnetic field through the at least one transducer element thereby generating electrical potential across a part of the at least one transducer element.

The object may be free to move in at least two degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom may be at least one of translational and rotational.

an object in the casing attracted to the magnet and free to move relative to the magnet in at least two degrees of freedom and

at least one transducer element positioned to be affected by changes in a magnetic field of the magnet 

wherein movement of the object relative to the magnet varies the magnetic field through the at least one transducer element thereby generating electrical potential across a part of the at least one transducer element.

In some embodiments the transducer element may comprise a magnetostrictive piezoelectric MP element and the electrical potential may be generated across a piezoelectric part of the MP element. Alternatively the transducer element may comprise an electromagnetic EM coil element.

an object in the casing attracted to the magnet and free to move relative to the magnet in at least two degrees of freedom and

at least one magnetostrictive piezoelectric MP element positioned to be affected by changes in a magnetic field of the magnet 

wherein movement of the object relative to the magnet varies the magnetic field through the at least one MP element thereby generating electrical potential across a piezoelectric part of the at least one MP element.

The object may be rounded. The object may be one of spheroid part spheroid frusto spheroid ovoid and part ovoid. The object may be solid. The object may be a ball bearing for example.

The magnet may be disposed at a fixed position in the casing. The casing may comprise a closed magnetically conductive or non conductive container.

In the absence of vibration experienced by the casing the magnet may tend to retain the object in a rest position. In the presence of vibration experienced by the casing the object may tend to oscillate about the rest position. The magnet may be positioned to exert a magnetic restoring force on the object to bias the object to the rest position.

When the object is at rest the object and magnet may be axi symmetric about a single axis. The magnet and a piezoelectric element of the at least one MP element may be poled in a direction orthogonal to a plane in which the object is free to move.

The device may further comprise a movement limiting structure disposed around the object to limit movement of the object relative to the magnet.

The at least one MP element may comprise at least two MP elements positioned to be affected by the magnetic field of the magnet. Two of the at least two MP elements may be disposed on opposite sides of the object. One MP element of the at least one MP element may be disposed adjacent a rest position of the object. One MP element of the at least one MP element may be disposed between the object and the magnet.

Some embodiments relate to a structure such as an aircraft or other vehicular structure subject to vibration and having fixedly positioned thereon or therein the device as described above.

Described embodiments relate generally to vibration energy conversion devices and systems deriving electrical energy from such devices.

Embodiments relate generally to devices configured to convert kinetic energy associated with a host structure experienced as vibrations by the device into electrical energy using the combination of a movable object a transducer element such as a magnetostrictive piezoelectric MP element or an electromagnetic coil element and a magnet to which the object is attracted. Using this combination movement of the object relative to the magnet varies the magnetic field through the transducer element to generate electrical energy. If the transducer element is an electromagnetic coil the variation of the magnetic field through it induces current flow through the electromagnetic coil. If the transducer is an MP element the variation of the magnetic field causes stresses which induce the piezoelectric part of the MP element to generate a potential difference i.e. voltage across at least a part of itself. This electrical energy may be used to charge a capacitor which may in turn be used to trickle charge a rechargeable power supply such as a rechargeable battery. This rechargeable power supply may then be used to supply power to a sensor whereby the sensor the power supply and the energy conversion device form a self powering sensor system when at least the energy conversion device is subject to accelerations inducing movement of the object relative to the magnet.

Employing an object that is untethered and or free to move with at least two degrees of translational as opposed to rotational freedom allows kinetic energy associated with vibrations of a multi directional nature to be harvested. Such arrangements may thus have applicability to aerospace applications or other applications where vibrations are frequently encountered.

Additionally the described arrangements enable construction of a compact energy conversion device having relatively low mass and volume compared to SDOF energy harvesters which is advantageous in some applications.

Some embodiments employ an inherently compact bi axial VEH approach that utilizes a permanent magnet ball bearing combination which operates in conjunction with a magnetostrictive piezoelectric MP element such as a Terfenol D PZT laminate transducer which may be described as one example of a magnetoelectric ME transducer. Such embodiments may thus use an oscillating bearing to create magnetic flux steerage through a magnetoelectric laminate transducer to generate harvestable electrical power. However as noted above some embodiments may employ an electromagnetic coil as another example of a ME transducer. For illustration purposes this description focuses mostly on use of a MP element as the ME transducer but this is not intended to limit the applicability of any described embodiments.

Referring now to B and to an energy conversion device according to some embodiments is described in further detail. show device in exploded and assembled configurations respectively. Device has a housing or casing with a base and a lid cooperating to define an enclosed volume within the casing . Casing including base and lid may be magnetically conductive although it is not strictly necessary. Casing may be generally cylindrical cuboid or rectanguloid in form for example. For illustration purposes a cylindrical casing is described herein.

As shown in casing may be mounted on or otherwise coupled to a host structure to have a chosen horizontal vertical or angled orientation. Host structure may be any suitable structure to which described energy conversion devices may be usefully coupled. The casing is fixedly coupled either directly or indirectly to the host structure so that movement of the host structure causes corresponding movement of the casing and its contents other than an untethered object .

As shown in the object is disposed within the enclosed volume of casing in proximity to a magnet and an MP element . The MP element is positioned between the magnet and the object so that the magnetic field emanating from the magnet and coupled into the magnetically conductive object passes through the MP element . This is illustrated in further detail in . The relative positioning of the magnet MP element and object are preferably selected to generally maximise the degree to which changes in object position are converted into electrical potential.

Device may also comprise a movement limiting structure distinct from the walls of the casing so that the object is not allowed to move beyond where the magnet can exert a magnetic restoring force on the object . Alternatively walls of the casing may act as a movement limiting structure although in such embodiments a non magnetic insulating layer may be provided on the inside of the walls.

In the embodiments illustrated in the movement limiting structure serves as a 360 mechanical stop and is provided by a non magnetic cup shaped element having an interior surface defining a central cavity within which the object is receivable. The cup shaped element also has a passage or recess formed at the apex or bottom of the cavity to house the magnet and MP element in close proximity to the object . In some embodiments the passage or recess may provide a thin layer of material such as a wear pad see and between the MP element and the object in order to mitigate wear on the MP element by movement of the object .

The wear pad may be formed as a thin disc of a hard material having a high Young s modulus e.g. around 350 GPa or higher and resistant to wear by the object as the object travels across the surface of the wear pad for example. The Young s modulus of the wear pad should be higher than the Young s modulus of the object which for chrome plated steel may be in the order of 300 GPa. The wear pad is preferably substantially non ferromagnetic. The material of the wear pad may be tungsten carbide or aluminium oxide for example. The wear pad may have a diameter of around 20 30 mm and a thickness of about 1.0 to 0.5 mm or possibly about 0.8 mm. Preferably there is a low coefficient of sliding friction and rolling friction between the object and the wear pad . A dry or fluid lubricant may be added at the interface between the object and the wear pad .

In other embodiments the object may be allowed to substantially directly contact the MP element or other transducer element although some kind of coating or lubricant on the MP element or other transducer element may be used to mitigate wear and or affect the coefficient of friction between the object and the MP element or other transducer element.

The cup shaped element may be formed of Teflon for example or other materials having similar low magnetic conductivity and or wear resistant characteristics. Materials other than Teflon that may be suitable include aluminium metal materials rubber or rubber like elastic materials alumina ceramic materials and suitable polytetraflouroethylene PTFE materials or similar polymers. Depending on the embodiment a wear pad may be positioned at the base of the element between the object and the magnet or MP element or EM transducer as described below. The cup shaped element may have a roughly annular cross section orthogonal to an axial centre line of the device i.e. as indicated by reference indicator in with the annular cross section of element transitioning to a smaller inside diameter where it defines the passage or recess . If the casing is magnetically conductive then the thickness of the annular wall of element may be selected to minimise magnetic attraction between object and casing .

The Young s modulus of the movement limiting structure where it will be impacted by the object may be significantly lower than that of the object for example by an order of magnitude or more. As an example aluminium has a Young s modulus of around 60 GPa and has been found to work well in described embodiments as a material for the movement limiting structure and to provide a vibro impact effect.

Embodiments described and depicted herein generally employ a spherical ball bearing as the movable object . However another form of rounded object may be employed in alternative embodiments including solid or partially solid objects. Such rounded objects include for example spheroid part spheroid frusto spheroid ovoid and part ovoid objects. The ball bearing described herein is formed of chromium plated steel. However objects of other magnetically responsive materials may be employed instead. If a spherical bearing is used as the object it may have a diameter of about 15 mm to about 30 mm for example. Preferably the diameter is about 20 to 25 mm.

In embodiments described herein the object is free to move in at least two dimensions. That is the object is free to move in at least the x and y directions if the central axis defines the z axis of a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Depending on the embodiment the wear pad or other support surface on which the object may move may have some degree of curvature like a curved bowl surface for example with the result that some movement in the z direction may occur simultaneously with movement in the x and y directions. Because the contemplated embodiments use a rounded object this movement will involve freely rolling in at least the x and y directions and possibly also in the z direction which equates to having at least two translational degrees of freedom. While it is contemplated that the object will have the freedom to rotate roll about an axis generally parallel with the x y plane and thus move translationally it has been experimentally determined that for certain embodiments such as are depicted in for example there may be rotation about the central axis or an axis parallel thereto. In embodiments adopting the configuration shown and described in relation to the object may move in an elliptical or circular orbit about the z axis.

For non spherical objects or objects that are only part spherical the movement of the object within the casing may be less translational i.e. rolling laterally away from or toward the central axis and involve more rotational or rocking movement. Reference to translational movement of the object herein is intended to refer to movement of the center of mass of the object. Depending on the shape of the object the center of mass of the object may not rotate significantly during the translational movement.

Described embodiments generally contemplate that the object is mechanically untethered within the casing with the only thing causing it to tend to return to the rest position absent any externally applied vibrational stimulus being the attraction of the object to the magnet . In other words the object is not mechanically connected to anything in the casing . However in alternative embodiments it may be possible to have some mechanical connection or coupling that amounts to some form of tethering between the object and a part or component in or on the casing while still allowing at least two degrees of freedom of movement of the object within the casing .

Referring also to device is depicted in the absence of movement limiting element for illustration purposes although element may be included as illustrated in . illustrates one of several possible configurations of the object MP element and magnet . In the depicted arrangement the MP element is directly interposed between the object and the one or more magnets . However in other embodiments such as are described with reference to the MP element may be positioned in a different arrangement for example involving magnets on opposite sides of the object and one or more than one MP element positioned around the object to be affected by variations in the magnetic field caused by movement of the object . Further the MP element is illustrated as one form of a generalised transducer element and can be substituted for an EM coil such as is shown and described below in relation to .

Referring to an alternative arrangement of device is shown designated by reference numeral by employing the same general components as described above. In arrangement object may be subject to a magnetic restoring force applied by the magnetic field of a magnet with which it is in contact or closely adjacent thereto. Magnet is coupled i.e. mechanically or magnetically affixed or adhered to the base . On an opposite side of magnet MP element is disposed together with a further magnet both positioned along the same axial centre line extending through the rest position of object and magnet . In this arrangement the magnetic field through object and MP element will be affected by both magnets and but movement of object will still vary the magnetic field through MP element in a manner generating electrical potential. Although not shown in a wear pad may be located between the object and the magnet .

A further variation in the arrangement of elements within device is shown in and indicated by reference indicator . In arrangement multiple MP elements are positioned on opposite lateral sides relative to vertical centre line of the object with the MP elements again being poled in a direction generally orthogonal to the plane in which object is free to move. In arrangement MP elements are positioned within closed wall sections of the casing . In other embodiments MP elements may be positioned interiorly of the walls of casing and held in place with the same polar orientation as described by other positioning structure. In some embodiments the positioning structure to hold MP elements in position relative to object may include cup shaped element or a further positioning structure cooperating with the movement limiting structure. In the arrangement shown in the object is magnetically coupled to magnet which is in turn coupled i.e. mechanically affixed or adhered to the base of the casing . In alternative arrangements magnet may be instead coupled to the lid . Although not shown in a wear pad may be located between the object and the magnet .

Further variations of the described arrangements depicted in may be employed including additional magnets and or MP elements . For example two or more of the arrangements shown in and may be combined. Additionally more than one pair of MP elements shown in may be employed with MP elements positioned at 90 intervals around the casing. Further more than two pairs of opposed MP elements may be employed such as 3 4 5 or 6 pairs of MP elements for example optionally arranged circumferentially.

While and show that casing is coupled to host structure via base casing may instead be coupled to host structure along a side wall or coupled so that the orientation of the casing relative to the host structure is different from that shown.

Magnets and described herein may be rare earth magnets for example. The magnets may have a remanent field of approximately 1.3 Tesla and the object may be a chromium plated steel ball bearing of mass approximately 67 grams for example. The magnetic fields generated by the one or more magnets serve a dual purpose to generate a magnetic field that applies a magnetic restoring force to the object which possibly in combination with movement limiting structure sets up oscillatory movement in response to an acceleration applied to the device and the magnetic field serves to attract the object under the magnet such that if device is exposed to an impulse acceleration then object tends to experience decaying oscillation about a rest position generally coinciding with a central axis . It should be noted that although generally circular cross section magnets are shown and described herein some embodiments may employ magnets that are non circular such as elliptical rectangular or other suitable simple or regular polygon shapes. Further other magnets may be used that do not have a continuous surface or that are non planar where such magnets are positioned adjacent the object or the MP element or coil . One example of this is the annular magnet .

Device and the various described embodiments may be generally axi symmetric about central axis although it is understood that perfect symmetry is generally not achievable or is impractical to achieve. If casing is not cylindrical and or MP elements are disposed at different lateral positions around object then at least object and magnets and or are preferably generally axi symmetric.

Although Terfenol D is described as one possible magnetostrictive layer Galfenol or other suitable materials may be employed in the magnetostrictive layer instead. Further magnets and or MP elements may have one or more of their surfaces coated with a ceramic material to reduce the effect of wear due to contact with the moving object .

Where a movement limiting structure such as cup shaped element is employed it should generally have a Young s modulus of similar order of magnitude to that of the object in order to assist in establishing oscillation around the rest position at a resonant frequency determined by the characteristics of the one or more magnets and object .

Referring also to a system is shown in which an energy harvesting device according to any of the described configurations including arrangements and is employed within or on a host structure and electrically coupled to a rechargeable power supply via a capacitor of suitable size and coupling conductors . Although not shown conductors are coupled to the piezoelectric layer of MP element or to EM transducer elements to allow transfer of electrical charge outside of the energy harvesting device. These conductors are coupled to capacitor e.g. via conductors and their signals may pass through a rectification circuit or devices e.g. diodes transistors or electrical transformers . In this way device or can charge capacitor from its oscillating electrical output and capacitor can in turn be used to trickle charge the rechargeable power supply . Power supply is then used to provide power via a suitable conductor to a sensor . Sensor may be any suitable sensor such as a strain load humidity temperature pressure distance flow or other sensor adapted to be powered by a relatively low power supply e.g. where the output power of the energy harvesting device is in the order of 0 to 200 microwatts or possibly up to tens or hundreds of milliwatts .

System may be contained within an external shell hull or skin of the host structure in some applications such as in marine automotive or aerospace applications where the sensor is an environmental sensor positioned to monitor structural health of part of the craft. In such applications sensor may communicate in a wired or wireless manner with a monitoring system in another part of the craft or external to the craft. For example an external handheld interrogator may be used to interrogate the sensor via a suitable interface such as an acoustic electric feed through interface positioned on an inside of the skin of the craft for example. It should be appreciated that system may be applied in various other situations outside of marine automotive and aerospace fields and thus the examples given should not be considered as anything other than illustrative.

In some embodiments MP element may be comprised of a number of separate but aggregated MP elements each providing a separate output in order to reduce an averaging effect that would be experienced across a single larger MP element and allow greater power to be harvested from certain MP elements that experience greater strain due to higher local magnetic field variation than in other areas. For example MP element may be made up of an array of tiled sub elements arranged in the x y plane where the x direction is into the page as shown in the Figures .

Described embodiments advantageously utilise a bi axial vibro impact effect set up by oscillation of the object about the rest position and elastic impact of the object with the movement limiting structure to yield a relatively broad frequency response of the energy conversion device to vibration of the host structure .

In an experiment to validate the hypothesised operation of the device the steel bearing was Cr plated and spherical with a diameter of 25.4 mm the rare earth magnets NdFeB grade N42 and the ME transducer were cylindrical with a diameter of 10 mm.

The ME transducer was formed by bonding the Terfenol D Etrema Products Inc. and PZT 5A elements Pz27 Ferroperm Piezoceramics A S with silver loaded epoxy Circuitworks CW2400 that was cured for two hours at 55 C under a compressive load of 1 MPA. To maximize output from the ME transducer the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers are 1.5 mm and 0.5 mm thick respectively. The host structure oscillates in the x y plane. The magnets and the piezoceramic 3 direction are poled in the z direction. The magnets are 10 mm thick and for experimental convenience two magnets were stacked together for a total magnet thickness of 20 mm and attached to a 5 mm thick steel base. A thin layer of bees wax was employed at the interface between the ME transducer and the upper magnet to minimize shear movement.

The bearing is subject to a magnetic restoring force in the x y plane where x is normal to the page and the y z plane is parallel to the page as in exerted by the magnetic field of the magnets however is otherwise untethered and free to move across the surface of the upper magnetostrictive element in response to host structure oscillations. Comsol multi physics software was used to make predictions about the restoring force Fy rotational effects were ignored . Magnetic force predictions were made shown in assuming that the ME transducer acted as a 3.5 mm gap between the magnet and the bearing i.e. there is a 3.5 mm separation between the bearing and the magnet in the z direction. Stable finite element solutions were obtained if the maximum element dimension chosen was 1.5 mm or less and also if the meshing of the magnet and bearing were of sufficient fidelity i.e. so that the finite element mesh contains small enough elements to adequately represent the modelled shapes .

The central line of the harvester is defined as the vertical line z direction through the centre of the magnet as shown by reference indicator in . predicts that Fy is linear near the central line i.e. y 2.0 mm and has a spring constant of k 260 N m. The bearing mass is approximately m 67 grams and hence the predicted resonant frequency of the bearing magnet arrangement is f 9.9 Hz. As the bearing moves from the central line towards the edge of the magnet then predicts that the restoring force Fy will behave as a softening spring.

The magnetic restoring force acting on the bearing in the x y plane is axi symmetric about the harvester s central line . If a bi axial host acceleration is applied i.e. in the x y plane then the bearing would be expected to map out a lissajous figure on the surface of the ME transducer. The rest position for the bearing is directly above the centre of the magnet along the central line . For other magnet and bearing diameters Dand D the bearing rest position will remain at the central line as long as D

The Comsol software was also used to visualize the static magnetic field distribution for various bearing positions. Of particular interest is the distribution of magnetic flux B in the ME transducer since this determines the stress distribution in the transducer and hence the voltage generated. Two dimensional modelling of the Terfenol D nonlinear magnetostrictive response was carried out. Predicted magnetic field distributions are shown in which magnifies the contact region between the bearing ME transducer. In the bearing is located at the central line and contacting the middle of the upper Terfenol D element whereas in the bearing is located 4.5 mm from the central line in the y direction. These figures show that the magnetic flux distribution in the upper Terfenol D element changes significantly as the bearing changes position.

A closer examination of the predictions of the magnetic flux density B in the y direction for the upper Terfenol D element is presented in . As the bearing moves across the surface of the upper Terfenol D element from the centre to the edge shows that B.y changes direction. The bearing is steering the magnetic field through the ME transducer. presents the average of each B.y line a to j plotted in . The large changes in both the magnitude and direction of the magnetic flux suggest that significant strain variations are being experienced at the piezoceramic layer.

In the experimental arrangement the harvester device as generally depicted in was attached to a 5 kg host mass connected to a 75 N vibration shaker. A maximum RMS host acceleration of 61 mG was chosen because at resonance larger host accelerations would drive the bearing off the ME transducer unless a movement limiting housing is used to constrain the bearing displacement and also introduce a vibro impact effect . The bi axial nature of the energy harvester is clearly seen in . is a graph showing nineteen measured frequency sweeps of the peak open circuit voltage generated by the harvester device. Sweeps were measured from low to high frequency in 0.2 Hz steps. A laser displacement sensor was used to measure the bearing displacement y direction during testing. The host acceleration was uni axial in the y direction. After each sweep the harvester was rotated by 5 degrees about the harvester s central line from the initial position designated as angle 0 through to an angle of 90 . The resonant maximum of each sweep was located at 9.8 Hz similar to the predicted resonant frequency of about 9.9 Hz predicted above. shows the maximum measured peak open circuit of the sweeps shown in .

The peak open circuit voltage of the harvester and the peak displacement of the bearing were measured as a function of RMS host acceleration. As the host acceleration was varied there was no significant change in the frequency of the resonant peak. shows that below an RMS host acceleration of 40 mG the measured open circuit voltages and bearing displacement increase in a linear fashion. There is however a clear gradient increase for both displacement and voltage when the RMS host acceleration is larger that 40 mG. It is surmised that the behaviour shown in is due to the softening spring effect as described earlier .

A load resistor sweep was carried out to determine the RMS output power of the harvester. Using an RMS host acceleration of 61 mG at 9.8 Hz the measured peak load voltage was 23.9 V across a 3.3 M load resistor yielding a maximum RMS load power of 121 W as shown in the plot of . At the maximum load power the measured peak bearing displacement was 4.61 mm hence the peak kinetic energy of the 67 gram bearing is estimated to be about 2.7 mJ. Surface wear at the bearing Terfenol D interface has been found to be an issue for arrangements where the bearing bears directly on the upper exposed surface of the magnetostrictive layer .

In summary a bi axial vibration energy harvesting approach has been demonstrated that utilizes a magnetoelectric transducer Terfenol D lead zirconate titanate Terfenol D located between an oscillating spherical steel bearing and a rare earth magnet NdFeB . The oscillating bearing varies the magnetic field through the ME transducer generating an oscillating charge that can be harvested. A bi axial device has been developed that is capable of harvesting 121 W from an RMShost acceleration of 61 mG at 9.8 Hz. The approach described produces an effective bi axial characteristic that may in the future be useful for kinetic energy harvesting for applications where the host accelerations are multi axial such as those seen in the aerospace environment .

Additionally walls are positioned around the object to define a free movement volume within which the object is free to move. The walls act as movement limiting structure so that translational movement of the center of mass of the object laterally beyond the edge of the MP element or EM coil or is restricted but not necessarily prevented. In laboratory experiments it has been observed that allowing the center of mass of a ball bearing to travel a small compared to the bearing diameter distance beyond the edge of the MP element improves harvested energy. For MP elements travel of the bearing a small distance past the edge serves to pull the magnetic field of the magnet more horizontally if central axis is vertical which serves to exert a stronger magnetostrictive effect on the MP element . For EM coils travel of the bearing a small distance beyond the edge of the coil can be beneficial because it is desirable have the bearing travel across the coil in a way that maximizes the change in magnetic flux over time in order to maximize the current generated in the coil.

The walls which may be made of sheets or panels in a cylindrical form for example may be selected to have a Young s modulus less and possibly substantially less than that of the object but preferably without exhibiting an appreciable dampening effect on oscillatory movement of the object in response to vibration of the host structure . The material of the walls may include or be formed of aluminium rubber or rubber like materials alumina ceramic materials or suitable PTFE materials or similar polymers.

Although the walls provide a movement limiting function to prevent the object from laterally escaping the magnetic field of magnet the walls also assist in providing a vibro impact effect that tends to broaden the frequency response of the device to vibration stimulus transferred through the host structure . This has been experimentally validated as described below.

The ME transducer was formed by bonding the Terfenol D Etrema Products and lead zirconate titanate elements Ferroperm Piezoceramics Pz27 with silver loaded epoxy Circuitworks CW2400 that was cured for two hours at 65 C. In order to maximize output from the ME transducer the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers were made 1.5 mm and 0.5 mm thick respectively. The magnets and the piezoceramic 3 direction are poled in the z direction. The magnets are 10 mm thick and for convenience two magnets were stacked together and magnetically attached to a 5 mm thick steel base .

The experimental arrangement had the vibration energy harvester attached to a 5 kg host mass connected to a 75 N vibration shaker. As shown in mechanical stops i.e. walls were created by bolting three aluminium spacers each 3 mm thick for a total 9 mm to each side of a steel housing with wall thickness 10 mm. During an impact event the bearing collides with an aluminium surface with the mechanical impulse load then transferred into the steel housing. The total inner distance between the two mechanical stops was 32.5 mm. Given that the bearing radius was 12.7 mm the stop gap distance is calculated as 32.5 2 12.7 mm 2 3.5 mm.

An accelerometer mounted on the 5 kg host mass was used to set the desired RMS host acceleration at host frequency 7.5 Hz prior to sweeping the frequency. Frequencies from 6 Hz to 14 Hz were swept in 0.1 Hz steps. Host frequencies below 6 Hz were not examined due to frequency limitations of the vibration shaker. Host acceleration variation was within 10 mG during a sweep where 1 G 9.8 m s . Dwell time at each frequency was 10 seconds after which time the next frequency step was immediately applied with care taken to ensure a smooth transition between frequency steps . Voltage and power measurements were made using a differential probe and oscilloscope. The measurement sampling rate was 12 kSPS. The measured capacitance of the ME transducer was 1.86 nF suggesting an impedance at 8 Hz of X 1 2 fC 10.7 M . This impedance is larger than the 8 M input impedance of the differential probe Hameg HZ109 so a large resistance 90 M was added in series with the probe to ensure that the transducer voltages were measured accurately.

As shown in for the smallest host acceleration used 27 mG there was little or no interaction between the harvester s oscillating bearing and the mechanical stops i.e. no vibro impact and hence the half power frequency bandwidth is a relatively narrow 0.23 Hz and centered at 7.5 Hz. The measured central frequency of 7.5 Hz is marginally lower than the predicted resonant frequency of 8.1 Hz presumably because of the softening spring effect. As the host acceleration is increased a vibro impact process between the bearing and the aluminum stops occurs producing an increase in the operational frequency bandwidth of the vibration energy conversion device . The largest host acceleration used 434 mG produced the largest bandwidth 7.2 Hz approximately 31 times greater than the bandwidth observed using a 27 mG host acceleration. The amount of frequency bandwidth increase is governed by the physical process of vibro impact which is a non linear effect.

As stated above in some embodiments MP element may be substituted for a different transducer element in the form of an electromagnetic coil for generation of a potential difference across output conductors . Examples of energy harvesting devices and using EM coils as a transducer element are shown and described in relation to .

Referring in particular to energy harvesting device is shown schematically to include the untethered movable object as a ball bearing attracted by a disc magnet affixed to a base . The magnet supports an EM coil that is interposed between the magnet and the object . A wear pad is positioned over the EM coil to protect it from wear and to allow the object to move roll with relative freedom. Thus variations in the magnetic field of the magnet due to movement of the object affect the magnetic field of the EM coil and induce a current in the EM coil. This current can then be harvested stored and used to power another device in the manner described above in relation to .

Depending on the arrangement of the outputs of the EM coil the electronics between the harvesting device or and the rechargeable power supply may need to be adapted to suitable process and harvest the output power. For example circuitry may include a step up voltage transformer in order to provide a useable output voltage to the rechargeable power supply or other power sink .

To test the possible use of the magnet coil transduction mechanism the arrangement depicted schematically in was examined. The static magnetic field arrangement was modelled using Comsol and then a prototype was built and experimentally tested.

Referring to as the bearing oscillates in the x y plane where x is normal to the page the magnetic field distribution in the coil changes. illustrates one possible non optimised coil orientation. Different coil configurations may be employed to greater or different effect. For example a segmented EM coil arranged as a toroid about a donut shaped magnet may be used as described below in relation to . Additionally more than one EM transducer may be employed with multiple EM transducers disposed near the magnet and object to have their magnetic fields affected by movement of the object for example in a similar manner to the arrangements shown in . However arrangements other than those of may be employed.

For the arrangement shown in shows the predicted static magnetic flux density for three bearing arrangements the bearing in a centered position Central Ball the bearing displaced from that position Offset Ball at y 15 mm and with no bearing. As the bearing moves from its rest position towards the edge a region of varying magnetic field passes through the coil which in turn induces a time varying current in the coil that generates a voltage across an attached load resistance.

An experimental arrangement similar to that shown in was investigated. A chrome steel ball bearing grade AISI 52100 with a diameter of 25.4 mm was used and a 30 mm diameter tungsten carbide 6 cobalt by mass wear pad was used to protect the upper surface of the wound coil and to provide a surface for the bearing to move on. A 238 turn coil was wound from copper wire with diameter 300 m and had a measured inductance of 4.1 mH and a measured resistance of 7.5 . The coil had a height of 4.2 mm with an approximate outer diameter of 30 mm and inner diameter of 10 mm. For the system described Comsol magnetic field predictions as shown in indicated a field differential of approximately 100 mT as the bearing moves from the central position to an edge 15 mm from the centre . The 10 mm inner coil diameter was chosen since it is similar to the width of the middle magnetic flux peak for the Central Ball as shown in .

A near optimum resistive load of 7.5 was applied and as shown in a series of sweeps were carried out to determine the output voltage and power from the harvesting arrangement. For the three host acceleration levels shown in the frequency was swept upwards through the range 7.5 and 12 Hz in 0.1 Hz steps with a 10 second dwell at each frequency step.

The measured results shown in are peak peak coil voltages across an optimised 7.5 resistive load using the harvesting arrangement of and show a softening resonant response. As the host acceleration increases so does the resonant displacement amplitude of the bearing producing larger output voltages across the optimised load. Table 1 below summarises the measured response from the harvesting arrangement and shows that the measured maximum RMS output power was 2.5 mW for an RMS host acceleration of 302 mG at 9.2 Hz.

It has been observed that for certain bearing magnet geometries and at certain host frequencies and accelerations the described bi axial magnet bearing harvesting arrangement has a tendency to produce elliptical or circular ball bearing displacements or orbits . This tendency can be exploited to convert a translational host acceleration into an elliptical ball displacement. Using a wire coil of appropriate geometry as the mechanical to electrical transducer this can form the basis of a bi axial vibration energy harvester.

A schematic illustration of an arrangement of this type of vibration energy harvesting device is shown in . A ball bearing moves on a wear pad mounted directly over a coil transducer . For the example configuration shown in a toroidal coil is shown wound around a donut shaped annular magnet with the magnet poled in the vertical z direction normal to the plane of the wear pad and base . The host acceleration acts in the x y plane as indicated by arrows . The center frequency is square root over where the bearing mass is M kg and k N m is the small amplitude spring constant of the magnetic force in the x y plane acting on the bearing . For host accelerations with frequencies close to fthe bearing may begin to undergo a resonant motion in the form of an elliptical displacement. Interestingly once a resonant ball motion has been established then the host frequency may be varied over a wideband and the ball bearing s resonant motion is maintained.

The use of a suitable configured coil in an arrangement such as that shown in offers the prospect of frequency up conversion whereby a low frequency mechanical excitation may be converted into a higher frequency electrical output that can be beneficial for vibration energy harvesting. Additionally a harvester with a suitably arranged coil such as the toroidal coil shown in may remove the necessity for signal rectification thus improving harvester efficiency and also simplifying the harvesting electronics in between the device and the rechargeable power supply .

Although do not specifically show movement limiting structure to limit movement of the object past the edge of the wear pad it is intended that such movement limiting structure be provided as shown in B or in another suitable form. Similarly the magnet EM coil and bearing arrangement of are suitably enclosed by housing structure for example in the manner described above in relation to B and .

Embodiments described above may additionally include one or more further magnets positioned laterally adjacent the magnet or in combination with a wear pad or other extended surface that allows the object to travel close enough to the one or more additional magnets that the object becomes more attracted to one such magnet and tends toward a point of stability absent externally applied vibration adjacent that magnet. For such embodiments the at least one transducer element includes one or more additional MP element or EM coil arranged adjacent the additional magnet or the at least one transducer element embodied as an MP element or EM coil for example is made large enough to be affected by changes in the magnetic field of the additional magnet. This arrangement may be described as being bi stable or multi stable as it may use two or more points of stability corresponding to peak magnetic attraction of the underlying magnets or .

Embodiments are contemplated in which an EM coil and MP element may be used in combination as transducers positioned to harvest energy due to movement of the same object within a single vibration energy harvesting device.
