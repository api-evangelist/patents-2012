This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. FA8650 08 C 7838 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor device which includes a graphene layer and more particularly to a semiconductor device which includes a graphene layer and first and second plural contacts.

Owing to reports of graphene s extremely high intrinsic mobility and unique electronic structure along with demonstrations of device cutoff frequencies in the hundreds of gigahertz range graphene transistors have become of great interest for electronic applications.

As illustrated in the graphene device may include a transistor having a front gate configuration and including a graphene channel formed on a substrate e.g. formed on an upper surface of the substrate such as an SiC substrate a gate dielectric formed on the graphene channel e.g. formed on an upper surface of the graphene channel source and drain electrodes formed on the substrate and contacting the graphene channel and the gate dielectric e.g. contacting a side surface of the graphene channel and a side surface of the gate dielectric and a gate formed on the gate dielectric e.g. formed on an upper surface of the gate dielectric .

In particular the source and drain electrodes may include metal contacts which are formed on a surface of a layer of graphene which forms the graphene channel .

As the performance of graphene devices has continued to increase so also has the understanding of transport properties and performance limitations. It has become apparent that controlling the interface between the layer of graphene and the metal contacts e.g. the source and drain electrodes i.e. controlling the metal graphene contact interface is one of the foremost challenges to maximizing performance in the graphene device . A variety of factors such as metal induced doping of the graphene in the graphene channel may result in contact resistances that can often dominate the operation of the graphene device e.g. graphene transistors .

To reduce the contact resistance various metals have been studied for the metal contacts. In addition a variety of contact annealing conditions have also been studied.

However to date none of the related art approaches has provided a complete solution to meaningfully reducing e.g. completely minimizing the role of contact resistance in the performance of the graphene device .

In view of the foregoing and other problems disadvantages and drawbacks of the aforementioned conventional systems and methods an exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device including a graphene layer which may have a reduced contact resistance Rand an improved transconductance as compared to conventional devices.

An exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device includes a substrate first plural contacts formed in the substrate a graphene layer formed on the substrate and on the first plural contacts and second plural contacts formed on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first plural contacts and the second plural contacts.

Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device including a substrate including a pair of trenches first source and drain contacts formed in the pair of trenches of the substrate a graphene layer formed on the substrate and on the first source and drain contacts an upper surface of the first source and drain contacts being substantially co planar with an upper surface of the substrate and the graphene layer being formed on the upper surface of the first source and drain contacts and the upper surface of the substrate and a difference in height e.g. an abrupt difference in height e.g. step edge between the upper surface of the first source and drain contacts and a height of the upper surface of the substrate being no greater than 5 nm such that the graphene layer includes an undistorted graphene layer and second source and drain contacts formed on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first source and drain contacts and the second source and drain contacts an area of the first source and drain contacts being substantially the same as an area of the second source and drain contacts and the first source and drain contacts being substantially aligned with the second source and drain contacts to form a double contact configuration.

Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a graphene field effect transistor FET including a back gate including a doped semiconductor substrate a gate dielectric including a dielectric layer formed on the doped semiconductor substrate first source and drain contacts embedded in the dielectric layer a channel layer including a graphene layer formed on gate dielectric and on the first source and drain contacts and second source and drain contacts formed on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first source and drain contacts and the second source and drain contacts.

Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of forming a semiconductor device including forming first plural contacts in a substrate forming a graphene layer on the substrate and on the first plural contacts and forming second plural contacts on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first plural contacts and the second plural contacts.

Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of forming a semiconductor device including forming first source and drain contacts in a substrate such that an upper surface of the first source and drain contacts is substantially co planar with an upper surface of the substrate and such that a difference in height e.g. an abrupt difference in height e.g. step edge between the upper surface of the first source and drain contacts and a height of the upper surface of the substrate is no greater than 5 nm forming a graphene layer on the upper surface of the first source and drain contacts and the upper surface of the substrate such that the graphene layer includes an undistorted graphene layer and forming second source and drain contacts on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first source and drain contacts and the second source and drain contacts in a double contact configuration an area of the first source and drain contacts being substantially the same as an area of the second source and drain contacts and the first source and drain contacts being substantially aligned with the second source and drain contacts.

With its unique and novel features the present invention may provide a semiconductor device including a graphene layer having a reduced contact resistance Rand an improved transconductance as compared to conventional devices.

In particular illustrates a semiconductor device according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention. As illustrated in the device includes a substrate first plural contacts formed in the substrate a graphene layer formed on the substrate and on the first plural contacts and second plural contacts formed on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first plural contacts and the second plural contacts.

The semiconductor device may include for example a field effect transistor FET in which case the first plural contacts form first source and drain contacts and the second plural contacts form second source and drain contacts the substrate may include a doped semiconductor substrate e.g. p Si substrate which forms a gate e.g. back gate of the FET and an oxide layer e.g. buried oxide which forms a gate dielectric layer and the graphene layer forms a channel layer of the FET.

The exemplary aspects of the present invention may provide a novel contact geometry for graphene transistors that provides improved carrier injection at the contacts to lower contact resistance and improve transconductance. The exemplary aspects may involve contacting graphene from below and above in a sandwich type configuration. Unlike related art devices in which contacts are only on top of the substrate supported graphene the exemplary aspects of the present invention may add another half of the contact below the graphene which may at least effectively double the contact area while maintaining a similar e.g. the same device footprint.

A reduction of contact resistance using a double contact e.g. sandwich like geometry comes primarily from increasing the contact area e.g. carrier injection between the contacts e.g. metal of the contacts and graphene. Further because an advantage of the exemplary aspects of the present invention may come from the novel geometry related art solutions may be applied in parallel with the approach of the exemplary aspects of the present invention for further improvement of the contacts.

As illustrated in the method includes forming first plural contacts in a substrate forming a graphene layer on the substrate and on the first plural contacts and forming second plural contacts on the graphene layer such that the graphene layer is formed between the first plural contacts and the second plural contacts.

As illustrated in a dielectric layer such as an oxide layer e.g. an SiOlayer is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate e.g. doped silicon substrate such as a p silicon substrate to form the substrate . The oxide layer may be formed for example by thermal oxidation.

As illustrated in the oxide layer is etched to form plural trenches in the oxide layer . The plural trenches may have a depth D in a range from about 20 nm to about 300 nm and a width W in range from about 20 nm to about 1000 nm.

As illustrated in the first plural contacts may be formed e.g. deposited in the plural trenches . The first plural contacts may be formed of a conductive material such as a metal e.g. gold nickel silver aluminum copper palladium platinum and may include one or more layers of different conductive materials. For example in an exemplary aspect of the present invention the first plural contacts are formed by forming a titanium layer in the plural trenches and forming a palladium layer on the titanium layer in the plural trenches 

In an exemplary aspect an upper surface of the first plural contacts is substantially co planar with an upper surface of oxide layer . In particular the first plural contacts may be formed such that a difference in height e.g. an abrupt difference in height e.g. step height between the upper surface of the first plural contacts and a height of the upper surface of the oxide layer is no greater than 5 nm.

As illustrated in the graphene layer is formed on the first plural contacts and on the oxide layer . The forming of the graphene layer may include growing single layer graphene by chemical vapor deposition CVD on a copper foil transferring the grown single layer graphene onto the substrate and the first plural contacts and patterning the single layer graphene. Alternatively the forming of the graphene may include mechanically exfoliating bilayer graphene from graphite flakes.

In particular since the upper surface of the first plural contacts and the upper surface of the oxide layer are substantially level and even e.g. a height difference is no greater than about 5 nm the graphene layer is not distorted at an interface between the oxide layer and the first plural contacts 

As illustrated in the second plural contacts may be formed on the graphene layer and on the first plural contacts . The second plural contacts may be formed of a conductive material such as a metal e.g. gold nickel silver aluminum copper palladium platinum and may include one or more layers of different conductive materials. For example in an exemplary aspect of the present invention the second plural contacts are formed by forming a titanium layer on the graphene layer forming a palladium layer on the titanium layer and forming a gold layer on the palladium layer.

The second plural contacts may be formed of a material which is the same or different than the first plural contacts and may be formed of more or less layers than the first plural contacts and may have a thickness which is greater than or less than the first plural contacts 

However in an exemplary aspect of the present invention the second plural contacts are substantially aligned with the first plural contacts such that an offset of a contact of the second plural contacts from a contact of the first plural contacts is not greater than about 20 nm.

In an exemplary aspect semiconductor device may include a field effect transistor FET . In this case the doped semiconductor substrate may serve as a backgate for the FET and the graphene layer may serve as a channel layer for the FET. In addition the first plural contacts may serve as first source and drain electrodes and the second plural contacts may serve as second source and drain electrodes. That is the FET may have a double contact configuration in which the source electrode of the FET includes contacts and the drain electrode of the FET includes contacts 

The inventors conducted experiments which show that for single layer graphene transistors there was a 2 reduction of contact resistance consistently observed for devices with double contacts versus those with only top contacts. Two types of graphene were studied by the inventors 1 single layer graphene that was grown by chemical vapor deposition CVD on copper foils and then transferred to the substrate containing bottom contacts and 2 bilayer graphene that was mechanically exfoliated from graphite flakes. The advantage for CVD grown films is the large coverage area.

As illustrated in to establish double contacts e.g. metal below and above the graphene in the source drain contact area plural contacts e.g. bottom contacts were first formed in a substrate which includes a doped semiconductor substrate e.g. p silicon substrate and an oxide layer e.g. 90 nm SiOlayer formed on the doped semiconductor substrate

Trenches were formed in an oxide layer of the substrate by patterning poly methyl methacrylate PMMA using e beam lithography followed by reactive ion etching RIE the oxide layer e.g. SiO in CFto a depth of 20 nm. The PMMA was then undercut by about 10 nm with a 10 second dip in 9 1 buffered oxide etch followed by the e beam evaporation and lift off of the metal layers e.g. 5 nm Ti 25 nm Pd which form the plural contacts 

The graphene layer was then patterned etched to include a first portion formed on the contacts a second portion e.g. a channel region formed between the first portions and projecting portions P P for use in testing the device e.g. graphene transistor . It should be noted that the projecting portions P P are only used for testing the device and are not necessarily included in the present invention .

Following the transfer of the graphene layer and patterning e.g. Oreactive ion etching RIE patterning of the graphene layer the contacts e.g. top contacts were formed by depositing metal layers 0.5 nm Ti 30 nm Pd 30 nm Au on the graphene layer and on the contacts 

A maximum offset between a contact of the contacts and a contact of the contacts in the double contact configuration was about 20 nm.

After the contacts were formed the device was annealed in vacuum at 130 C. for 10 hours prior to being electrically tested.

An important feature of the device is that an upper surface of the contacts is substantially co planar with an upper surface of the substrate and the graphene layer is formed on the upper surface of the contacts and the upper surface of the substrate . In particular a difference in height between the upper surface of the contacts and a height of the upper surface of the substrate is no greater than about 5 nm which may help to ensure that the graphene layer is not distorted e.g. an undistorted graphene layer .

Note that the p Si substrate may be used as a gate e.g. back gate for controlling an operation e.g. gate voltage V of the graphene transistor e.g. controlling a conductance of the channel layer in the device .

As illustrated in the test results show that improvement in current is seen for both types of graphene e.g. CVD grown single layer graphene and mechanically exfoliated bilayer graphene FIG. B in the double contact geometry of the exemplary aspects of the present invention. However the improvement is more pronounced in the bilayer case of . In both cases and the enhancement in current is greater at high gate bias far away from the Dirac point . This may be evidence of a decrease in contact resistance which dominates at gate biases that are far from the neutrality point.

A more thorough analysis is obtained using the additional contacts V V e.g. voltage probes as shown in . Importantly these contacts V V e.g. voltage probes are external from or noninvasive to the graphene layer keeping the contacts V V from perturbing transport in the graphene layer e.g. channel by induced doping.

A very useful aspect of the four probe structure e.g. device is a clean extraction of the contact resistance Rc as follows 1 2 where Ris the resistance between the source and drain contacts Ris the resistance between the contacts V V e.g. voltage probes Vand V and L L and W are the dimensions defined in .

In contact resistance R was taken at V V 20 V. In spite of significant variation the double contacted devices e.g. device consistently exhibited lower Rthan the devices with only top contacts. The lowest R s for each geometry are 450 m for the top contacts and 260 m for the double contacts. The horizontal lines indicate the average value.

When working with graphene particularly CVD grown graphene there can be a considerable amount of variation in the cleanliness and or quality of the graphene surface after undergoing transfer. The four probe structure which was tested by the inventors considers the resistance of each device s graphene channel to extract the resistance at its contacts thus allowing for a fair comparison of Rfor different devices.

In the study conducted by the inventors thirty 30 test sets of single layer graphene devices according to the exemplary aspect of the present invention were tested with each test set having side by side graphene transistors one transistor with double contacts according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention and one transistor with only top contacts for the source and drain as illustrated in .

Also studied was a set of twelve 12 bottom contacted devices that were also on single layer graphene. All voltage probes e.g. Vand Vin transistor and Vand Vin transistor were top contacts because the resistance of top contacts does not affect their sole purpose of monitoring voltage.

The distribution of contact resistance Rfor the double contacted devices and top contacted devices in the test sets in clearly illustrates why having a large sample set is essential for drawing conclusions about the quality of a certain contact geometry. Just as the quality of the graphene channel can vary across a semiconductor chip so also can the condition of the graphene that interfaces with the contact metal local defects residual resist etc. . Therefore a sizeable amount of variation in Ris observed even when fabricating transistors with the same geometry and in very close proximity on a semiconductor chip.

Despite this sizeable variation in R the plot in reveals that the double contacted graphene transistors in the test set consistently exhibited lower Rthan their top contacted transistors in the test set .

A summary of some key performance metrics comparing the double contacted devices according to the exemplary aspects of the present invention with bottom contacted devices and top contacted devices is given below in Table I. In Table 1 contact resistance Rwas taken at V V 20V where Vis the voltage at the Dirac point.

Compared to the single layer graphene devices the exfoliated bilayer devices were much harder to come by because they relied on random placement of the graphene onto predefined bottom contacts. Thus while the inventors tested thirty 30 test sets including the double contacted devices and top contacted devices and twelve 12 bottom contacted devices with single layer graphene the inventors tested six 6 test sets including the exfoliated bilayer devices. The data from the testing of the exfoliated bilayer devices is included above in Table 1.

As illustrated in Table 1 there is a nearly 40 drop in contact resistance Rgoing from top contacted single layer devices to double contacted single layer devices which averaged 320 m with a low of 260 m which to the inventors knowledge is the lowest reported contact resistance Rfor a CVD grown single graphene layer with previous reports from various graphene sources falling in the 500 m to 1000 m range.

As further illustrated in Table 1 the bilayer double contacted devices reached an even lower average Rof 250 m with a low of 180 m. In addition there was an improvement in average peak transconductance g and correspondingly the peak field effect mobility of 31 for the single layer graphene devices and an improvement in average peak transconductance g and correspondingly the peak field effect mobility of 21 in the and bilayer graphene devices respectively.

The reason for gand improving less than Ris that improvement of the contacts is more clearly observed when the graphene layer is biased far from the Dirac point V e.g. when the device is in the ON state . It is when Vis swept closer to the Dirac point V that the resistance in the graphene channel dominates and more dramatic modulation of the current takes place to yield the peak gvalue thus as seen in the characteristics in . Take for instance the higher average mobility observed in the bottom contacted devices compared to the top contacted ones even though the contact resistance is higher.

While the bottom contacted devices are not on the same graphene channels as the double contacted devices the average Rfrom the different device sets does provide insight into the improved performance. Unlike in the top contacted device the substrate gate does not influence the doping level of the graphene in the source drain areas for the bottom contacted device. Therefore the 36 higher contact resistance Rin bottom contacted devices can be attributed to the lower doping level.

Using an electrostatic model with an effective graphene metal distance d 1 and W W c 200 meV where Wand Ware the palladium and graphene work functions respectively and Ac is a correction coefficient due to the correlations the observed differences in Rcan be better understood. For double contacted graphene devices according to an exemplary aspects of the present invention e.g. transistor this model e.g. for gate capacitance C d where is the electric constant and d is the thickness of the dielectric layer e.g. graphene layer and gate voltage V 0 predicts a 23 lower doping level than that in the top contacted device e.g. transistor .

Taking into account that an increase in graphene metal coupling by a factor of two 2 would translate to a 2 reduction in contact resistance Rin a diffusive contact one would expect a contact resistance of 460 m in double contacted devices. This is 40 greater than the measured resistance of 320 m. This remaining difference may be attributed to a greater metal induced doping in double contacted graphene than in the one sided contact geometries e.g. top contact only geometry and bottom contact only geometry owing to the increased coverage of the metal on the graphene e.g. see where the graphene layer is contacted by the first plural contacts and the second plural contacts .

In the case where bilayer exfoliated graphene is used in the device e.g. device according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention the reduction of contact resistance Rby approximately a factor of two 2 is expected in electrically decoupled layers e.g. misoriented layers since carrier injection takes place for each layer independently. However analysis of an AB stacked bilayer graphene is more complicated than analysis single layer graphene due to the uncertainty in the ratio of transfer length and an electrical coupling between the layers of the bilayer graphene which determines an overall contact resistance Rreduction in the range of 2 to 2.

Ultimately the double contacted bilayer graphene creates a carrier transport scenario that warrants its own complete study of transport physics.

In conclusion the inventors have demonstrated that a double contact geometry e.g. a metal contact below the graphene layer and a metal contact above the graphene layer at the source and drain in a graphene FET may provide improved performance compared to conventional devices which have only top contacts. The results of experiments conducted by the inventors e.g. testing of dozens of double contacted and top contacted four probe structures show a consistent reduction of contact resistance Rbetween the contacts and the graphene layer and an improvement of transconductance in the device according to the exemplary aspects of the present invention as compared to conventional device. On average in the tests conducted by the inventors contact resistance Rdropped from 525 m to 320 m where the graphene layer e.g. graphene layer in was single layer graphene. The inventors attribute the observed improvement in contact resistance Rto both an enhancement of the effective graphene metal coupling and a higher graphene doping in the presence of the second metal layer.

With its unique and novel features the present invention may provide a semiconductor device including a graphene layer having a reduced contact resistance Rand an improved transconductance as compared to conventional devices.
