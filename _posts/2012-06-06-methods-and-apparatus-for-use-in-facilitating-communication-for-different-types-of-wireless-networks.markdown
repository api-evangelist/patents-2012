The present disclosure relates generally to techniques in electronic devices which are configured for wireless communications such as Wi Fi peer to peer P2P wireless communications.

A wireless communication device such as a portable battery powered wireless telephony device may be configured to communicate in wireless communication networks. For example such a device may communicate via access points APs of wireless local area networks WLANs in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards or the like. Such a device may additionally communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device.

Techniques in a wireless device for facilitating communication for different types of wireless networks are described herein. In one illustrative example the device displays a list of identifiers of wireless networks and receives an input request for selecting one of the wireless networks for communication. When the selected wireless network is of a first type the device attempts to establish a connection with the selected wireless network. When the selected wireless network is of a second type the device launches or displays an input prompt to launch an application having a stored association with a device type received from the selected wireless network.

To illustrate one environment within which the techniques of the present disclosure may be practiced illustrates a wireless communication device which may communicate in a communication system . In the communication system wireless device may communicate with one or more wireless communication networks. For example wireless device may communicate with a wireless communication network which is a wireless local area network WLAN . Here wireless network and wireless device may operate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards.

In this example wireless network has a plurality of wireless access points APs and for wireless communications with wireless device . WLANs may be identified by a wireless device with use of a wireless network identifier which is communicated from the WLAN. The wireless network identifier may be for example a Set Service Identifier SSID or Extended SSID ESSID . In this example wireless network includes one or more servers a redirect server and a gateway . Server may provide data applications and or functionality for communication services for wireless device .

Wireless network may be a public Wi Fi hotspot for public use and include what may be referred to as a captive portal or walled garden. For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway is configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality as well as to permit or deny external access outside of wireless network to Internet . To do this gateway has a set of IP address filters which define a set of addresses that are permissible impermissible if any at all for access by devices. Access by a device depends on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization.

Typically when a request by a device in wireless network is made prior to proper authorization gateway is configured to redirect the request to redirect server . In response redirect server is configured to respond to wireless device to provide data for producing information e.g. Web page information which is rendered in a visual display of wireless device via a Web browser application. The information may solicit a user response. For example the information may solicit a user registration or login with user fields for entering a user name and or password information. Gateway identifies whether the received user response is sufficient e.g. whether the user name and password match prestored user name and password information whether the user payment is accepted whether the user acceptance is confirmed etc. . If the user response is deemed sufficient gateway permits access to the data applications and or functionality in or outside of wireless network .

Wireless device may also operate for communications in other different wireless networks such as a wireless network which is also a WLAN. In this example wireless network is a private communication network of an enterprise e.g. an organization a company a corporation etc. of wireless device . Similar to wireless network wireless network has a plurality of wireless APs and one or more servers and a gateway . For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway may be configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality offered via wireless network depending on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization. For devices attempting to access wireless network via Internet gateway is configured to permit or deny internal access to the data applications and or functionality in wireless network .

Such wireless networks e.g. infrastructure WLANs may provide or allow access to various data and communication services to its terminals. For example the wireless networks may provide for communication access to Internet via the Web browser application or voice telephony communication service with use of Voice over IP VoIP communication or other communication services. For push type data or message synchronization services for example wireless device may be enabled to maintain data synchronization with a server e.g. server for user data of an application associated with a user account. The application of wireless device and the server may be or include for example an electronic mail e mail application program for the communication of e mail messages.

Wireless device may be additionally configured to access communication services via a Public Land Wireless Network PLMN e.g. a cellular telecommunications network . PLMN includes a core network a plurality of base station controllers such as a base station controller BSC coupled to core network and a plurality of base stations such as a base station BS and a base station coupled to associated BSCs . Core network BSC and BS operate in a conventional fashion as well documented. Other PLMNs in the environment have a similar or the same architecture as PLMN . For communication with PLMNs wireless device may be configured in accordance with one or more cellular telecommunication standards such as Global Systems for Mobile GSM and or General Packet Radio Service GPRS technologies. However such wireless device may additionally or alternatively operate in accordance with other such cellular standards such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Long Term Evolution LTE or EVolution Data Only EV DO for CDMA technologies as a few examples.

Further in additional to being operative for communications with infrastructure WLANs e.g. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLANs wireless device additionally or alternatively communicates using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device.

Accordingly illustrating further in wireless device and one or more other wireless devices and in may be operative to establish Wi Fi P2P wireless network connections with each other in a Wi Fi P2P wireless network. Here one of the communicate devices may be configured to enter into an AP mode of operation so that other communication devices may associate with them for direct RF communications therebetween. An AP mode of operation which may be referred to as a wireless AP mode or the like provides a benefit due to the high data rates available over WLAN links. Here again data may be communicated directly between the wireless devices without the data traversing any wireless network infrastructure where one of the devices is set to operate or serve as an AP switching operation from as an end terminal and the other device operates as an end terminal to associate and connect with the AP i.e. wireless device operating as an AP for communications. Wireless device may operate such that when in the AP mode of operation with other communication devices and it also operates as a client with another AP.

Properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include a persistent property or indication which indicates whether or not the Wi Fi P2P wireless network is persistent. If the network is persistent when an application is opened or activated the wireless device connects to a previously established Wi Fi P2P wireless network.

Properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include a coexistence indication or property which indicates whether the Wi Fi P2P wireless network connection associated with this profile may be maintained while the wireless device operates as a client in an infrastructure network. Properties may additionally or alternatively include another coexistence indication or property which indicates whether the Wi Fi P2P wireless network connection associated with this profile may be maintained while maintaining another Wi Fi P2P wireless network connection.

Properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include an application name is the name of the application associated with the profile. Relatedly properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include an application link or address pointer to the application in memory of the wireless device.

Note that properties in profiles may omit a device identifier which identifies any particular device for connection and or may omit a wireless network identifier which identifies any particular wireless network for connection. Rather properties in at least some of profiles indicate connection with particular types of devices and or services and or indicate connection with particular types of networks as opposed to specifically identified devices or specifically identified networks.

It is noted that many peer to peer use cases for Wi Fi P2P wireless networking lend themselves to different modes of operation. For example if a wireless device supports a network gateway feature e.g. a mobile hotspot or MHO feature then the wireless device may be configured to establish a persistent Wi Fi P2P wireless network when the service is enabled. As another example the same wireless device may require a printer service to allow an application to print a document. In this case the Wi Fi P2P wireless network may be established on demand based on an application trigger. In another example a social networking application may periodically search for other communication devices running the same social networking application which may result in the wireless device operating in a periodic discovery mode for other devices which advertise the same service.

To accommodate for such various use cases profiles associated with the various application services utilizing Wi Fi P2P wireless networks are created and stored on the wireless device. These profiles are enabled when needed such as enabled in response to an activation of an application associated therewith. Further the profiles may be enabled concurrently.

In one embodiment the profiles may have data structures defined for compatibility with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification. Each profile may include information specific to Wi Fi P2P wireless network operation including device discovery behavior service discovery options co existence with infrastructures connectivity as well as operational characteristics of the network e.g. whether it is persistent or triggered on application launch .

These profiles may be provisioned as defaults in the wireless device and or may be configured by applications when installed. Further the profiles may be configured via the user interface of the wireless device with use of a human machine interface HMI application that provides management of the profiles. This HMI application may be configured to provide the ability to search for and identify any Wi Fi P2P wireless networks.

The profiles are used to manage the behavior of the WLAN or Wi Fi driver of the wireless device to accommodate for the various application services. The driver may be configured to support each particular use case. More particularly the driver may use the profile information to manage peer to peer communications on the wireless device as well as to arbitrate between Wi Fi P2P wireless network and other modes of connectivity e.g. infrastructure STA mode . The driver may be further configured to support other application requirements such as sleep modes discovery modes and or co existence with an infrastructure network connection over WLAN etc.

An example set of properties and or parameters relating to the behavioral characteristics are summarized in Table 1 below. The properties parameters in Table 1 may be a subset of parameters contained in such Wi Fi Direct profile to control wireless networking behavior. Such properties parameters may be included with a set of standard operating parameters for the driver.

The wireless device is configured to store a plurality of profiles in its memory. Some of the profiles may be profiles associated with a first type of wireless network e.g. WLAN infrastructure network type and some of the profiles may be profiles associated with a second type of wireless network e.g. Wi Fi P2P wireless network type . Each profile of the second type may be associated with an application of the wireless device and includes properties and or parameters contained therein. One property in the profile of the second type is a device type property which indicates a device type associated with the profile. Another property in the profile of the second type is application name and or application link to an application associated with the profile.

Beginning at a start block of the wireless device identifies whether an event or condition has occurred step of . The event or condition may be the receipt of an input request via the user interface for searching for displaying and or manually selecting an available wireless network for communication a loss of a network connection or an expiration of a periodic timer as a few examples.

In response to identifying the event or condition in step the wireless device performs a scanning operation for identifying wireless networks in its surrounding coverage area step of . The wireless device then displays a list of identifiers of these wireless networks step of . One of the wireless networks identified in the list may be manually selected for communication by the user via the user interface.

Note that step may be performed at a different time than that provided for in . For example in response to identifying the event or condition in step the wireless device may display a list of identifiers of wireless networks that were identified through a previous scanning operation prior to the identification of the event or condition.

To illustrate the displaying step of shows an illustrative example of the display of the wireless device which is displaying a list of identifiers of wireless networks one network of which may be manually selected via the user interface for communication. The list may be presented in a display window of a utility or application of the wireless device such as a wireless network connection management utility. The list of identifiers may include one or more set service identifiers SSIDs one or more extended SSIDs ESSIDs or both. In this example the list of identifiers of wireless networks includes an identifier JJOWifi an identifier ATT272 an identifier mrltd an identifier DMC an identifier mediajunkie an others.

The identified wireless networks may be of a first type e.g. a WLAN infrastructure type or a second type e.g. a Wi Fi P2P type . Here identifiers and are identifiers of wireless networks of the first type e.g. the WLAN infrastructure type and identifiers and are identifiers of wireless networks of the second type e.g. the Wi Fi P2P type . Each identifier in the list may include a device type associated with the corresponding wireless network.

Note that wireless networks of the second type may include a P2P wireless device which is designated as a group owner GO to serve as a wireless access point AP broadcasting beacon frames and or operating in a listening mode. As another example wireless networks of the second type may additionally or alternatively include a P2P wireless device which is not a group owner GO but operates in a listening mode.

Referring back to the flowchart of the wireless device may receive an input request for selecting one of the wireless networks for communication step of . If an input request is received in step then the wireless device identifies whether the selected wireless network is of the first type or the second type steps and of . The wireless device may make this identification based on any suitable technique.

In some embodiments the wireless device identifies whether the selected wireless network is of the first type or the second type based on a predetermined data element which may or may not be associated with the network. More particularly the wireless device may identify whether the selected wireless network is of the first or the second type based on whether a predetermined data element is received from the selected wireless network. For example the predetermined data element may be a peer to peer P2P element which includes a device type. See e.g. the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification which defines a peer to peer P2P element. In such embodiments the wireless device may identify that the selected network is of the second type based on receiving from the selected network a peer to peer P2P element which includes the device type but otherwise identify that the selected network is of the first type based on a failure to receive a peer to peer P2P element from the selected network.

If the wireless device identifies that the selected wireless network is of the first type e.g. WLAN infrastructure type then the wireless device attempts to connect with the selected wireless network step of . If the attempt to connect is successful step of then a wireless connection has been established with the selected wireless network. The wireless device may then communicate in the connected network for one or more services and the flowchart ends at a done block in . If the attempt to connect is unsuccessful in step then the wireless device may display a connection failure step of and repeat operation back to step awaiting an alternative request via the user interface.

If the wireless device identifies that the selected wireless network is of the second type e.g. Wi Fi P2P type then the wireless device performs different operations than that for the first type. The wireless device reads the device type associated with the selected wireless network step of . The device type may be received from a wireless network which is of the second type. Correspondingly no device type may be received from a wireless network of the first type.

The wireless device proceeds to identify one or more applications in memory which have a stored association with the device type step of . For each application there may exist a corresponding profile and for each profile there may exist a device type property and an application name and or application link to the application. The wireless device may identify one or more applications in step by comparing the received device type with the device type property stored in each one of the profiles. If a match is identified based on the comparing then the wireless device reads an application name and or application link which is stored in the profile for identifying the application.

If an application is identified step of then the wireless devices launches or displays an input prompt for launching the identified application step of . Here the wireless device uses the application name and or application link from previous step to launch or display the input prompt. In some embodiments no attempt to establish a connection with the selected wireless network has been made at this time. Rather only upon or after launching or the application the wireless device attempts to connect with the selected wireless network step of . If the attempt to connect is successful step of then a wireless connection has been established with the selected wireless network and the launched application will be utilized for communication with the selected wireless network.

If there are no stored applications associated with the device type in step then the wireless device is redirected to a server see e.g. server of for obtaining an application associated with the device type step of . No attempt to establish a connection with the selected wireless network has been made at this time. The server is configured to provide an application downloading service for devices. The server may store and or maintain access to a plurality of different applications and provide devices with any of these applications for download and installation. In some embodiments the server is configured to operate as an Application Store for the device to obtain e.g. purchase and or download any one of the applications.

The wireless device may display an input prompt for downloading the application associated with the device type from the server. If the wireless device submits a request to the server for an application step of then the wireless device proceeds to download i.e. receive the application from the server step of . After receipt of the application the wireless device installs the application step of so that the application is executable on the device. The wireless device may optionally cause operation to proceed back to step for the user to the re enter the input request for selecting one of the wireless networks for communication. Alternatively the wireless device may launch or display an input prompt for launching the recently received and installed application e.g. step of .

On the other hand in step the user may alternatively choose to refrain from submitting a request to the server in which case operation will proceed back to step awaiting for an alternative input request to select one of the wireless networks.

As the server may maintain access to a large number of different applications the server may be further configured to provide a search function for searching for the application relevant to the device type. The search function allows for a search query to be submitted to the server to search for a particular application. The search query is submitted in a search field in the display of the wireless device. In response to the search query the server will return search results which include a list of identifiers for one or more applications relevant to the device type. The wireless device may then request and obtain one of the applications.

In some embodiments when the wireless device is redirected to the server in step the wireless device automatically populates the search field with the device type or relevant terms associated with the device type . The wireless device may also automatically submit to the server the search query which includes the device type or the relevant terms associated with the device type . The search results which include the list of identifiers of the applications relevant to the device type are provided in the display of the wireless device. Even further the application may be automatically downloaded and or installed in the device so that the application may be launched.

In some embodiments when the selected wireless network has a device type that corresponds to one or more predetermined device types the wireless device allow for immediate connection. Specifically if it is identified that the selected wireless network is of the second type in step then the device type is read in step and compared to one or more predetermined device types. If a match between the device type and the predetermined device type exists then processing proceeds to step i.e. attempt to connect with the network without identifying or launching any applications. In one example a predetermined device type may be an Internet gateway device.

As provided herein techniques in a wireless device for facilitating communication for different types of wireless networks have been described. In one illustrative example the device displays a list of identifiers of wireless networks and receives an input request for selecting one of the wireless networks for communication. When the selected wireless network is of a first type the device attempts to establish a connection with the selected wireless network. When the selected wireless network is of a second type the device launches or displays an input prompt to launch an application having a stored association with a device type of the selected wireless network.
