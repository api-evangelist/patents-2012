title: Method and system for associating context information with defined location data
abstract: An approach for enabling contextual categories to be associated and scored in connection with a defined geographic region is described. An affinity determination platform identifies an anomaly in a score associated with at least one contextual category of a defined geographic region based on information related to the points-of-interest. The affinity determination platform generates an updated score to associate with the at least one contextual category based on the analysis of verification information related to the defined geographical region and associates the updated score with the contextual category.

Service providers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of location based services. Typically most location based services and real time context processing services rely on the detection or acquiring of context information related to the user both real time and static to execute their various functions and features. This may include for example global positioning data and motion data e.g. as provided via the user s mobile device demographic information user ranking data user profile information behavioral data etc. Unfortunately traditional approaches provide no convenient way by which location based service providers may render contextually relevant applications and services without reliance upon user centric context data.

Based on the foregoing there is a need for enabling contextual categories to be associated and scored in connection with a defined geographic region.

An apparatus method and software for enabling various contextual categories to be associated with and scored by their level of affinity with various points of interest located within the defined contextual categories is described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Although the various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to points of interest POIs located in a given geographic region it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any elements capable of being associated with a given location. This may include for example events venues activities promotions devices people buildings landmarks and the like. For the purpose of illustration points of interest POIs may correspond to any such elements.

Unfortunately there is currently no convenient solution by which location based service providers may render contextually relevant applications and services without reliance upon user centric context data. Also service providers that offer context and or location based services are limited in their ability to determine the propensity of a given geographic region to be associated with a given context.

To address this issue the system includes an affinity determination platform that enables one or more contextual categories to be associated with a defined geographic region featuring multiple POIs. In addition the platform enables a score to be assigned to respective categories by defined geographic region based on a level of affinity of the category with various points of interest located within the defined geographic region.

According to certain embodiments the affinity determination platform maintains contextual category data referred to as categories data . The categories data includes a list of context types and associated data points related to each respective context type for a defined geographic region. The data points may include information for characterizing describing qualitatively or quantifying various POI associated with a given context type. By way of example a context type of Events may be maintained as category data for defining an event related context corresponding to the defined geographic region. Associated data points information related to this context type may include event names event types times sponsors and event locations. As another example a context type of Businesses may be maintained in the database for defining a business related context. Associated data points information for this category may include for example business names business and or industry types e.g. marketing firms engineering firms employee counts revenue ranges business rankings and business locations.

It is noted that the data points may be static or dynamic values depending on the context type. For example data points for referencing a specific name of a landmark or address location may require less frequent updating. Conversely data points for referencing a specific volume of sales within a defined time period e.g. current by hour by week a number of coupon redemptions a number of emergency services a rate of use of a service etc. may require frequent updating. Hence the data points for association with a given contextual category may be accessed from various data sources provided by a service provider subscribed to access the affinity determination platform or by various third party logistics sources. Also of note the categories data may be accessed by the platform for cross reference against POIs corresponding to the defined geographic region.

In certain embodiments the defined geographic region includes various named tagged and mapped location points and or POI. For the purpose of illustration the affinity determination platform accesses this data from a defined grid database such as the United States National Grid reference system or any other reference grid. Alternatively the defined grid data may include any other location data source geodetic data source topographic data source geographic information system or the like for specifying and naming points coordinates within a particular geographic region.

The affinity determination platform may be configured to identify POIs within a specified range or domain. For example the platform may access defined grid data to within a range of X meters miles by Y meters miles from a focal point. The focal point may be specified as a zip code specific set of coordinates address name of a point of interest keyword or the like. Under this scenario the affinity determination platform cross references the category data against the various location data points from the database to within a finite range for enabling analysis. As will be discussed more fully later on with respect to the exemplary use cases described in the platform may cast or transmit data regarding the various contextual categories to one or more calling services having access to the platform .

In certain embodiments the affinity determination platform also determines a score and corresponding signal strength to associate with each of the assigned contextual categories for a defined geographic range. By way of example in the case of a context category of Business with a corresponding business type of Law Firms a score may be generated based on the number of POIs identified as law firms. Under this scenario the score may indicate a level of affinity i.e. on a scale of 1 to 10 between POIs located within the defined geographic region and the different contextual categories. It is noted that the score may further indicate a specific level of likelihood of existence presence of the associated POI a density or concentration of POIs a rate of occurrence of the POIs or a combination thereof corresponding to the contextual category within the region.

In the case of a scaled ranking from 1 to 10 for example a score of 8.2 may indicate a higher propensity for law firms to be located within one region than a score of 4.3 for another region. As another example a score of 9.0 for POIs corresponding to the contextual category of Restaurants may indicate a higher propensity for restaurants to be located within the same geographic region than law firms. As yet another example a score of 1.5 for POIs corresponding to the law firm type of General Practice may indicate a lower propensity for such firms to be within the specified geographic region than firms that specialize in Mergers and Acquisitions having a score of 6.3. Hence a score may be associated with a specified region based on varying levels of granularity and specificity of contextual categories thus corresponding to a plurality of subcategories i.e. as per the level of granularity and specificity of the categories data . In addition the defined geographic region may also feature POIs that correspond to multiple different categories. Consequently the affinity determination platform may account for overlapping contextual categorizations for a single defined geographic region.

In addition to the score signal strengths may also be generated to be associated with a defined geographic region. In certain embodiments the signal strength corresponds to a color based indicator wherein the color visually depicts a context to associate with the defined geographic range. By way of example contextual categories corresponding to Businesses may be assigned a color of blue while those corresponding to Restaurants may be assigned the color red. Under this scenario different contextual categories may be readily distinguished by users when rendered in connection with the defined grid data to an interface. Also the signal strength corresponds to a level of affinity between a respective contextual category and the various points of interest actually located within that region and may be related to the assigned score. Hence the signal strength may be represented in the form of a graphic chart e.g. bar graph metric indicator or the like for indicating a level of affinity from low to high. In the case of a bar graph for example the length of the bar may visually indicate the relative level of affinity.

It is noted the signal strength does not correspond to a wireless signal associated with a particular wireless carrier or telecommunication service provider. Rather the signal strength is a metaphorical representation of the level of effectiveness and prevalence of POIs matching a given contextual category for a defined region. For example in the case of a region defined by the United States National Grid the signal strength indicates the effectiveness or prevalence of a particular context for this defined grid. Hence the prevalence of a particular context will change based on the characteristics of the geographic region and related POIs i.e. residential versus industrial urban versus rural social demographics income environmental conditions etc.

In certain embodiments scores are calculated by the affinity determination platform based on a scoring algorithm or other data ranking technique. The scoring algorithm may rank or score a particular contextual category for a given defined region based on various scoring criteria. The criteria may include one or more variables that are culled from the data points associated with respective categories for a particular geographic region. By way of example the criteria may include the number of known POIs for a given contextual category or type e.g. total number of restaurants libraries schools gymnasiums a number of sub categories associated with the contextual category type a popularity rating associated with the contextual category type or population density. Other criteria may also include address data e.g. as per the defined grid data the category data or other location data source or a number of residential commercial or landmark properties within proximity of a given address within the geographic region.

Still further the scoring algorithm may also process existing signal strength data for a particular contextual category. Under this scenario the score may be abstracted from the signal strength associated with the category or other related categories for the defined geographic area. Of note the scoring algorithm may be adapted to accommodate varying types of scoring scenarios and procedures.

In certain embodiments the affinity determination platform also determines the occurrence of anomalies in a score assigned to a particular contextual category. The anomaly may correspond to a discrepancy between the score and information regarding the various POIs within the defined geographical region. By way of example the platform may flag a 8.5 score assigned to a Cajun restaurant as anomalous in response to determining few associated data points exist for indentifying the presence of restaurants specializing in Cajun cuisine. As another example the platform may determine an anomalous score and signal strength occurrence in an instance where a contextual category of Barber Shop is erroneously associated with data points corresponding to a butcher shop for the defined geographic area.

In response to an anomaly the affinity determination platform generates an updated score to associate with the at least one contextual category based on information related to the points of interest. By way of example the updated score is produced based on a normalization of the scores and the anomalous score. The normalization may be performed based on analysis of information related to the various POIs including data points maintained as category data . Under this scenario data points of interest for performing the normalization may include information regarding the number of POIs related to a particular context.

In keeping with the previous example regarding the Cajun restaurant the number of actual known restaurants that specialize in Cajun cuisine is culled from the data . In addition the number of restaurants within the defined geographic region is determined such as to determine the relative preponderance of Cajun restaurants to the entirety of restaurants. Based on this information the anomalous score and the scores assigned to the various other restaurant categories are reduced by a common factor corresponding to the preponderance the total number of restaurants etc. It is noted that various different normalization factors may be considered for performing the data normalization. Moreover various data transformation techniques including those performed by way of one or more models may be employed.

In addition to the above scenario the affinity determination platform also can perform a comparison of the normalized score against verification information retrieved from various sources other than the category database . The comparison enables the updated score to be further refined based on the culling of additional information for verifying the contextual category associated with the defined geographic region. As noted previously the level of affinity may be enhanced to the extent relevant information is accounted for in verifying the effectiveness or prevalence of a context. Information retrieved from the various sources may include for example public information such as various online content servers location databases property information repositories and the like. In addition wireless carrier information such as the relative location and usage statistics for a given business or building may also be culled. In the later scenario the wireless carrier information may be provided to the affinity determination module based on a partnership or shared operational arrangement.

In addition to generating the updated score the affinity determination platform also updates the signal strengths relative to the scores and the updated score in real time. By way of example a predictive based model e.g. constructed using Predictive Modeling Markup Language PMML may be used to process the scores along with verification information related to the different POIs for determining a change in value of the scores and associated signal strengths. The models may be accessed by the affinity determination platform from an independent cloud based platform thus ensuring different services and or applications access the affinity determination platform based on their own requirements. As a platform and schema independent solution the provider of the affinity may define one or more models independent of various service providers that mine the output database generated by the platform for storing results. Of note service providers having access to the affinity determination module i.e. via a subscription arrangement may employ standard schema data definitions and other data structuring requirements to accommodate different access and usage needs.

As mentioned above the scores the updated score and signal strengths for respective contextual categories of the defined geographic region are stored by the affinity determination module for subsequent retrieval. Hence the defined grid data is stored in connection with the determined contextual categories and scoring data. This is depicted by way of example as output data . By storing this model output in association with a specified context i.e. context binding various calling services may retrieve the data in real time via a user interface generated by the platform . This includes retrieval of locus coloring information for the entire defined geographic domain or specific portions thereof e.g. Midwest Region only . As time progresses the color associated with the signal strengths as presented via the interface are also dynamically updated. The color coding associated with a given context is dynamically adapted such as to refine the convergence of a locus coloring for the defined geographic region.

In certain embodiments it is contemplated the color scheme may be used by providers of various services as a means of categorizing and identifying different defined geographic regions e.g. Foodie regions versus Industrial regions by context or vice versa. Still further service providers may access the output rendered by the affinity determination platform to enable real time monitoring of consumer or user activity for a given context by geographic region. For example a coupon service provider may monitor real time adaptations in scores and signal coloring trends in order to target specific markets or coordinate ad campaigns.

It is noted that the above described approach whereby various services may access contextually relevant location data is in contrast to performing data acquisition based on user related data and characteristics. Under this approach demographic data behavioral data profile information or user device generated sensor data is not required to support application use.

It is noted that user devices UDs may be any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer Personal Digital Assistants PDAs smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UDs can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchange of data. In addition user devices may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information including touch screen capability keyboard and keypad data entry voice based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices are applicable. For the purpose of illustration UDs may be devices for accessing the affinity determination platform as a user of an application or as a service provider.

In certain embodiments user devices the affinity determination platform services and other elements of system may be configured to communicate via a service provider network . According to certain embodiments one or more networks such as data network telephony network and or wireless network can interact with the service provider network . Networks may be any suitable wireline and or wireless network and be managed by one or more service providers. For example telephony network may include a circuit switched network such as the public switched telephone network PSTN an integrated services digital network ISDN a private branch exchange PBX or other like network.

Networks may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including for example code division multiple access CDMA long term evolution LTE enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS mobile ad hoc network MANET global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like. Meanwhile data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN the Internet or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network such as a proprietary cable or fiber optic network.

Still further the communication provider network may embody circuit switched and or packet switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit switched and or packet based communications. It is further contemplated that networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner the communication network may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 SS7 network Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.

It is noted though not shown in the figure that in certain embodiments user devices may be configured to establish peer to peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies near field communication NFC Bluetooth ZigBee infrared etc. Also connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network LAN . By way of example a group of user devices may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to dynamically assign private DHCP internet protocol IP addresses to each user device i.e. IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network as facilitated via a router.

In addition the analysis determination platform also maintains or accesses various databases including a category database for storing context categories by context type and associated data points a models database for maintaining one or more models generated by the provider of the platform or by one or more service providers a defined grid database for accessing data regarding the defined geographic region and an output database for storing the result set generated by the platform . It is noted that modules access one or more of these databases for performing their respective functions.

In one embodiment an authentication module authenticates users e.g. those related to a service provider of user devices for interaction with the affinity determination platform . By way of example the authentication module receives a request to subscribe to the platform for enabling on demand access to color coded contextually defined location information. The subscription process may include for example establishing one or more access credentials and usage policies. One or more privacy settings and or preferences may also be established. Preferences and settings information may be referenced to a specific user user device service provider or combination thereof and maintained as subscription data not shown .

The authentication process performed by the module may also include receiving and validating access credentials or established for a particular user. For example a login name and or user identification value may be received from the user device or other device via a graphical user interface to the platform e.g. as enabled by user interface module . Subscription data for respective subscribers which contains pertinent user or device profile data may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as registration data with an IP address a carrier detection signal of a user device mobile directory number MDN subscriber identity module SIM e.g. of a SIM card radio frequency identifier RFID tag or other identifier.

The authentication module may also be configured to automatically enable the retrieval output data by various service providers in response to a request from an application or service related to the provider. Under this approach the authentication module receives the request and passes it to the various other modules to accommodate the requirements of the request. It is noted that the authentication module may also retrieve various models based on the request type to be fulfilled or the service provider service that requested the output data or portions thereof.

In one embodiment the context interpreter identifies a specific set of contextual categories per the categories data are to be related to a particular defined geographic region. The interpreter then associates a particular color code with a particular contextual category. In the case of a fully generated output featuring a set of defined geographical region data in connection with scores signal strengths and contextual categories the interpreter may also operate in connection with a user interface module to affect presentment of the output. For example the content interpreter may cause various descriptors relating to the different contextual categories to be rendered to a user interface for supporting service provider interpretation of the results set . More regarding the descriptors for the various contextual categories is discussed more fully with respect to .

In one embodiment the analysis module calculates or analyzes scores and or corresponding signal strength information associated with the different contextual categories of a defined geographic region. The analysis module calculates the scores in instance where no prior score is associated with a given contextual category assigned to a particular defined geographic region. Under this scenario the score is determined based on analysis of the context type and associated data points corresponding to the context type including qualitative and quantitative details e.g. a number of POIs a sales volume regarding the category. Based on this analysis an initial score and corresponding signal strength is associated with the contextual category subject to refinement over time or real time refinement depending on the frequency of updating of various data points associated with respective contextual categories.

The analysis module also analyzes current score data against the respective data points to determine if an anomaly exists in any score assigned to a specific contextual category for a defined region. The anomaly may correspond to a discrepancy between the score and information regarding the various POIs within the defined geographical region i.e. the score is determined to be higher than expected relative to the limited number of actual locations events services or other POIs within the defined geographic range. The analysis module may be configured to perform analysis of the scores and associated data points e.g. information regarding the points of interest periodically or on demand to accommodate different service providers services and application requirements.

In one embodiment the scoring module operates in connection with the analysis module to generate and update scores. Similar to the analysis module the scoring module may rely upon various processing models and scoring algorithms to generate scores. In addition the scores may be developed based on the analysis results rendered by the analysis module .

The scoring algorithm used may rank or score a particular contextual category for a given defined region based on various criteria mined from the categories database e.g. various data points relating to one or more POIs . By way of example the criteria may include the number of known POIs for a given contextual category or type e.g. total number of restaurants libraries schools gymnasiums a number of sub categories associated with the contextual category type a popularity rating associated with the contextual category type or population density. Other criteria may also include address data e.g. as per the defined grid data the category data or other location data source or a number of residential commercial or landmark properties within proximity of a given address within the geographic region.

Also in certain embodiments the scoring module facilitates generation of a normalized score such as to render an updated score and or signal strength in response to a determined discrepancy anomaly. Per this execution the scoring module and analysis module may perform a comparison and contrasting of the data pertaining to the various POIs e.g. data points for a particular context type with verification data relating to said POIs. The verification data may include publicly available data or wireless carrier proprietary data. It is noted that the scoring module may access various data sets for generating scores via the communication interface accordingly.

In one embodiment the grid access module retrieves the defined geographical range data maintained as defined grid data from a data source. This includes retrieval of an entire reference grid or portions thereof for enabling the analysis and scoring capabilities of the analysis and scoring modules and respectively. In addition the grid access module compiles the output data . As such the grid access module persistently updates the output data in response to the persistent updating of scores and signal strengths for a defined geographic domain. Of note the grid access module may also enable execution of various filters for permitting searching of the output data such as to restrict the data results by contextual category context type signal strength score location etc.

In one embodiment the data sharing interface operates in connection with the authentication module and user interface module to permit the accessing of the output data by various service providers. The data sharing interface may retrieve various models including one or more predictive models in which to mine the output data with respect to a particular application and or service. Hence the data sharing interface may access a cloud based repository wherein various models corresponding to a specific service provider are stored. For the purpose of illustration the models correspond primarily to a predictive model maintained by the platform and are used for predictive analytics of scores and signal strengths relative to changing temporal factors and points of interest characteristics. It is noted however that various other model types may also be employed.

In one embodiment the user interface module enables presentment of a graphical user interface for presenting the output data . By way of example the user interface module generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces APIs or other function calls corresponding to a browser application or dedicated application thus enabling the display of graphics primitives. As another example the user interface module may also operate in connection with a calling service or application to permit rendering transformation or translation of the output data in response to a request.

In one embodiment a communication interface enables formation of a session over a network between the affinity determination platform and the services and user devices . By way of example the communication interface executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a subscriber s user device e.g. mobile devices laptops smartphones tablet computers desktop computers servers workstations and the platform over the network . It is noted that the communication interface is also configured to support a browser session i.e. the retrieval of content as referenced by a resource identifier during a specific period of time or usage of the browser.

The above presented modules and components of the platform can be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Though depicted as a separate entity in it is contemplated that the biometric authenticator may be implemented for direct operation by respective user devices . As such the affinity determination platform may generate direct signal inputs by way of the operating system of the user device for interacting with the calling services or applications . In another embodiment one or more of the modules may be implemented for operation by respective user devices as a platform hosted solution cloud based service or the like. It is noted that the various modules may be used selectively or in combination within the context of a location based service.

In step of process the affinity determination platform determines scores associated with one or more contextual categories for a defined geographic region. As mentioned previously the scores indicate a level of affinity between points of interest located within the defined geographic region and the contextual categories. The contextual categories may include data for defining various context types including a market type a service type a business type an activity type a product type an event type or a promotion type at different levels of granularity. In addition the contextual categories may be associated with data points for representing characteristics of the points of interest within the defined geographic region.

In step the platform identifies an anomaly in a score associated with at least one of the contextual categories based on information related to the points of interest. As mentioned previously the contextual categories may be defined as a combination of data for indicating various context type and associated data points. The data points may correspond to data for quantifying or characterizing the one or more points of interest related to a particular contextual category.

In step the platform generates an updated score to associate with the at least one contextual category based on the analysis of verification information related to the defined geographical region. The verification information may include for example information regarding a wireless carrier or service provider e.g. network and or location data or public information. The public information may include various websites or repositories for use in confirming the existence presence location relevance or other details regarding a given point of interest within a defined geographic region. Per step the platform associates the updated score with the contextual category.

In step of process the platform updates in real time signal strengths to associate with the different contextual categories based on predictive modeling of the scores and the updated score. The predictive model may be used to process the scores along with verification information related to the different POIs for determining a change in value of the scores and associated signal strengths. In step the affinity determination platform also associates the scores the updated score and the signal strengths with the defined geographic region.

Per step the platform causes in response to a request transmission of the scores the updated score and the signal strengths associated with the defined geographic region. This corresponds to accessing of the output data set e.g. which may be retrieved based on various data mining techniques or based on various data retrieval protocols. The request may also be facilitated based on various models i.e. those generated by a service provider including data transformation models analytic models models corresponding to the specific application or service or the like.

In step of process the affinity determination platform normalizes the scores and the anomalous score based on information related to the points of interest to generate the updated score. Per step the platform compares the updated score against the verification information to further refine the updated score. It is noted that scores and strengths are refined and eventually updated in response to the adaptation of information regarding the various points of interest e.g. events places venues etc. .

In the first column of the table defines various context types while a second column defines the various data points associated with a given context type. By way of example the context type of Coupon Redemption corresponds to retail and or consumer transaction related matters. As per the description data points associated with this particular context type include for example coupon redemption data by number of items sold and revenue index. These data points may be further compiled by length of campaign campaign type etc. Hence under this scenario coupon activity for a defined geographic region may be accessed and scored by the affinity determination platform accordingly.

In a table is shown per the specific context type . In this example various coupon redemption categories or subcategories corresponding to the specified context type are shown. Under this scenario the redemption categories are delineated by service and or product type as well as the number of items products sold relative to the service and or product type. Thus in the case of data point s related to the subcategory of Golf a corresponding number coupons redeemed for this category is featured.

It is noted that the categories subcategories may be delineated in various other ways including by product code or manufacturer. Also while the example herein is related to retail other incentive or activation offers may apply. Also the affinity determination platform may be employed in connection with various other contexts including law enforcement or social services. For this context the data points may correspond to a number of crimes a number of deaths a number of births a number of families etc. within a defined geographic region.

In a user employs an incentive finder application via their mobile device to locate deals within a defined geographic region of which they are located e.g. their present location . The incentive finder application operates at the client and is supported by a backend location based system maintained by a service provider. The service provider retrieves data from the affinity determination platform to enable various features. For example the user is able to define various search criteria via a search criteria selection input menu including the category by which to conduct the search e.g. Restaurants various keywords of interest Italian Wine and results sortation criteria e.g. Highest Signal Strength . It is noted that various other criteria may also be defined depending on the application. The search criteria corresponds to a search context and thus associated context type and data points in which to identify one or more bound matching POIs.

In this example the sortation criteria of Highest Signal Strength may correspond to a number of scoring and or signal strength considerations. For example by selecting this option the results rendered may be ordered according to which restaurants offer the most incentives within the location of the user the highest number of offers redeemed for restaurants within the location of the user the highest rated within the location of the user or a combination of such factors. While not shown the service provider may enable the users to configure the incentive finder application to accommodate different scenarios. For this scenario upon activation of the SEARCH action button the user is presented with a list of corresponding POIs i.e. restaurants corresponding to the search criteria .

The results set includes an icon e.g. for the restaurant a descriptor e.g. for providing details regarding the restaurant and the associated offer incentive and a signal strength indicator e.g. for visually depicting the level of affinity of the restaurant with the defined context the search criteria . In this use case the signal strength indicator corresponding to the defined contextual category Restaurants is directly integrated for use in the application. This enables the user to scroll through various options to select the offer most related to their desired context.

In a user subscribed to the platform accesses a user interface to the platform to monitor scores and signal strengths associated with a given contextual category. Under this scenario the defined geographic region to which the various scores and signal strengths correspond is presented against mapping information. The contextual category is defined as Food Drink which further corresponds to various subcategories. For example the Food and Drink category may be further abstracted into Chinese Cuisine .

A score of 6.8 and corresponding signal strength indicator indicate that there is a higher preponderance of POIs for this location than some of the other categories. By way of example the signal strength indicator associated with the Food Drink category of Mexican Cuisine can be visually discerned by the user as having lesser affinity with the defined geographic region . By way of this interface the user is also able to readily identify the context based on a color coding scheme associated with each contextual category. It is contemplated that a mixture of colors may be visually rendered to the interface at varying levels of intensity or expanse for indicating the relationship affinity between a myriad of contextual categories and the defined geographic region .

The exemplary techniques and systems presented herein enables contextual categories to be associated and scored in connection with a defined geographic region. One advantage of the exemplary techniques and systems presented herein is the ability to define a context with a location without reliance upon sensor data or user demographic information. Another advantage is the ability to automatically predict anomalies in generated scores and signal strengths relative to POI changes within the defined region.

The processes described herein for enabling contextual categories to be associated and scored in connection with a defined geographic region may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .

According to an embodiment of the invention the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Model ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium or non transitory i.e. non volatile media and volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to enable contextual categories to be associated and scored in connection with a defined geographic region. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly the invention is not limited to such embodiments but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements.
