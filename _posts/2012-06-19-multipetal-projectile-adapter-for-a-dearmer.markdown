title: Multi-petal projectile adapter for a dearmer
abstract: A multi-petal adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter includes a plurality of petals that are secured, in a detachable way, to a base. The main function of the base is to secure the petals until the projectile is fired from the dearmer. Whereupon, the adapter will start petalling until the petals become detached from the base, so that the adapter imparts minimal or no energy or damage to the intended target. The adapter fully regulates the energy imparted to the various projectiles, by allowing propellant gases to bleed through channels that are formed between the petals. As a result, the present adapter fully supports a proper projectile launch and ensures its proper orientation toward the target.

The present invention relates in general to the field of devices for disarming bombs and ordnance. In particular the present invention relates to an adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer.

One technique for rendering an explosive ordnance device safe is to de arm that device by rendering its fuze mechanism inoperative. This can be accomplished by destroying or damaging that fuze mechanism so that its firing pin will not be able to contact the detonator device. In this manner the detonator will not set off the warhead of the ordnance device. De arming an explosive ordnance in this manner requires the propulsion of a fuze destroying device against the fuze with enough power to sufficiently damage the fuze and render it inoperative.

This result is generally accomplished by firing a projectile or a slug from a dearmer aimed for example at the fuze of the target with enough velocity to impact a portion of the fuze extending out over the ordnance case. This impact bends the whole fuze body rendering the firing pin movement impossible or in some cases actually decapitating a portion of the ordnance item.

Currently available dearmers de armers or disrupters are designed to be exclusively used with projectiles of predetermined sizes. As more clearly illustrated in the projectile fits into a matching bore in the dearmer body . This limitation poses a serious logistics concern to the soldiers in the field in that they are currently forced to use several dearmers that are dimensioned for different projectiles.

What is therefore needed is an adapter that enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter should allow the dearmer to impart the appropriate amount of energy to the various projectiles in order to propel them along the properly orientation. Furthermore the adapter should guide the projectile toward the target. However the adapter itself should not impart significant energy or damage to the target. Prior to the advent of the present invention the need for such an adapter has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and describes a multi petal adapter for use in conjunction with a dearmer. The adapter enables projectiles of different sizes to be used in a single dearmer. The adapter includes a plurality of petals that are secured in a detachable way to a base.

The main function of the base is to secure the petals until the projectile is fired from the dearmer. Whereupon the adapter will start petalling until the petals become detached from the base so that the adapter imparts minimal or no energy or damage to the intended target.

The adapter fully regulates the energy imparted to the various projectiles by allowing propellant gases to bleed through channels that are formed between the petals. As a result the present adapter fully supports a proper projectile launch and ensures its proper orientation toward the target.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

A dearmer of the present invention and its methods of assembly and use will now be described with reference to . shows the dearmer as being generally comprised of a tubular body that is open at both its forward end and its aft end .

In this particular example which is shown for illustration purpose only it is desired to use a projectile or slug having a inch outer diameter in a larger size body with a 1 inch inner diameter forward bore . It is further desired to use a cartridge case of a uniform caliber that can be used to propel projectiles of different sizes without compromising the efficiency of the dearmer .

The cartridge case is inserted into a rearward bore inside the body through the aft end and is then threadably locked in position with a breech . The projectile is fitted into a multi petal adapter and the projectile adapter assembly is then inserted into the body through the forward end .

Considering now the adapter in greater detail with respect to illustrates the adapter as being formed of a plurality of petals wherefore the name multi petal adapter. In this particular illustration the adapter comprises three identical petals . It should however be understood that a different number of petals may be used and that these petals may differ in shape depending on the intended application.

The petals are secured at their aft ends to a base . While in this particular example the base is shown as being cylindrically shaped it should be clear that the dimensions and shape of the base may vary. In the present illustration the outer diameter of the base is approximately 0.415 inch and its height is approximately 0.125 inch.

The main function of the base is to secure the three petals until the projectile is fired from the dearmer or until the projectile impacts a target . Upon firing the adapter will start petalling until at least some of or all the three petals become detached from the base so that the adapter imparts minimal or no energy or effect to the intended target .

An important feature of the adapter is to allow some propellant gases to bleed or escape through the adapter upon firing of the cartridge case in order to control the energy imparted onto the projectile via the adapter . To achieve this goal the three petals are separated by three axial gas escape channels so that the adjacent petals e.g. are separated by a channel e.g. . In the present illustration the width of each channel is constant along its entire length and is approximately 0.125 inch.

Considering now an exemplary design of the representative petal in connection with B and . The petal includes a flat arcuate front edge having a width of approximately 0.0625 inch. The outer arc of the arcuate front edge defines in combination with the corresponding arcuate front edges of the other two petals and the gas escape channels the outer diameter of the adapter . In this respect every two adjacent channels e.g. form an angle of 120 as represented by the central angle ACB .

The petal further includes two generally similar flat external sides and that extend from the arcuate front edge to a flat bottom edge B . The external sides along with the corresponding external sides of the other two petals define the gas escape channels . In this illustration the length of each external side is approximately 1.750 inches.

The arcuate front edge extends internally downwardly toward the bottom edge into a flared flange that is defined by two sides and that terminates in an internal arcuate edge . The angle of inclination a between the arcuate front edge and each side is approximately 45 .

As further illustrated in the flared flange along with the corresponding flanges of the other two petals define a generally conical funnel . The funnel assists in the petalling of the adapter as it will be explained later in more detail.

The internal arcuate edge defines in combination with the corresponding internal arcuate edges of the other two petals and the gas escape channels the inner diameter of the adapter . In this illustration the inner diameter of the adapter is approximately 0.375 inch in order to accommodate the inch outer diameter projectile .

The two external sides and the flared flange extend internally into an arcuately shaped bore section . The bore section along with the bore sections of the other two petals form an inner chamber for receiving the projectile .

In a preferred embodiment the adapter is made of heat and pressure resistant material such as polymers. It should however be understood that other suitable material may alternatively be used.

The adapter may be made as an integral unit by machining or molding. With reference to the representative petal is shown to be integrally made with the base and forms a attachment section therewith. This attachment section provides a secure but weakened connection between each petal and the base in order to ensure the petalling and thus the destruction of the adapter prior to the penetration of the projectile through the target .

The assembly of the adapter within the dearmer will now be described in connection with . The dearmer is assembled for use by inserting the projectile within the bore of the adapter . The adapter that houses the projectile is then inserted into a cavity or bore that is formed in the forward end of the body so that the arcuate front edge of the adapter is substantially flush with a forward tip of the body .

In this position and as illustrated in the adapter does not extend to the rear end of the cavity because the projectile is smaller than a projectile for which the bore was dimensioned e.g. compared to the slug which fills the entire cavity of the body in .

When the projectile adapter assembly is secured within the body the adapter defines an internal energy release chamber within the cavity . One of the functions of the energy release chamber in combination with the channels is to reduce the pressure behind the adapter in order to further control the exit velocity of the adapter and consequently that of the projectile .

By manually reducing or expanding the volume of the energy release chamber the user is capable of regulating the amount of energy imparted to the projectile . As an example if the projectile has much smaller dimensions than the projectile for which the bore was dimensioned the energy required to propel the projectile would need to be minimized. The volume of the energy release chamber is controlled by the seating position of the adapter in the body . As a result the user has the option to either expand or reduce the volume of the energy release chamber by changing the seating position of the adapter . This provides a controllable degree of adjustment of the chamber volume which affects the exit velocity of the projectile adapter assembly.

The operation or use of the dearmer of the present invention will now be described with further reference to and . illustrates the dearmer as being assembled and positioned for firing toward the target .

In a preferred embodiment when the air contacts the funnel the petals start to pivot outwardly about the until the time of impact of the projectile with the target . It is possible that during flight some or all the petals become detached from the base however in the preferred embodiment it the impact shock causes all the petals that have not already broken away from the base during flight to separate therefrom at the attachment section .

In the present embodiment the bore of the body is smooth and the petals are designed with corresponding smooth outer surfaces. It should however be clear that in order to accommodate rifled bores rifling grooves could be cut into the petals of the adapter . These grooves when used in a rifled disruptor or dearmer will impart spin to the adapter and slug during flight.

Although the present safety dearmer has been described in connection with one exemplary application it should be clear that the dearmer may have multiple commercial applications including but not limited to law enforcement.
