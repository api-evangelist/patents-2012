Biotin binding protein and their derivatives can be widely used in various applications. However production or purification of recombinant biotin binding proteins can be very difficult. When expressed in most biotin binding proteins tend to accumulate in inclusion bodies denaturing refolding and tedious downstream processing are required in the preparation of active proteins. Expression in is preferable because of the low cost of production and the potential for further engineering thus biotin binding proteins that can be efficiently produced in are highly sought after. Further expression also provides the possibility to generate recombinant fusion proteins containing biotin binding protein for various applications.

In yet another aspect the invention provides biotin binding fusion protein comprising a biotin binding domain and a protein or a peptide.

In another aspect provided herein is a lipidated biotin binding protein. As used herein the term lipidated biotin binding protein refers to a biotin binding protein that is covalently linked with a lipid. The lipidated biotin binding proteins are ligands or agonists of Toll like receptor 2. Accordingly also provided herein are methods for inducing an immune response in subject. The method comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising a lipidated biotin binding protein.

Provided herein is also a method of expressing a lipidated biotin binding protein in . In some embodiments the method comprises expressing a lipidated biotin binding protein in wherein the native signal sequence of the biotin binding protein has been replaced by an signal sequence containing a lipidation motif. In some embodiments the signal sequence is MKKVAAFVALSLLMAGC SEQ ID No 3 

In still another aspect provided herein is a non hemolytic derivative of Staphylococcal alpha hemolysin Hla . The Hla derivative described herein can be in the form of a fusion protein wherein the fusion protein comprises both the Hla derivative domain and a biotin binding domain. In some embodiments of this aspect the biotin binding domain is a biotin binding protein described herein.

Like the lipidated biotin binding proteins the Hla variants or their fusion proteins with biotin binding proteins described herein are also ligands or agonists of Toll like receptors or other pattern recognition receptors PRRs .

Provided herein also is a method of vaccinating a subject e.g. a mammal e.g. a human with the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein the method comprising administering a vaccine composition as disclosed herein to the subject.

It should be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular composition methodology protocols and reagents etc. described herein and as such can vary. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which is defined solely by the claims.

Without wishing to be bound by a theory low expression of a biotin binding protein in the art can be due to bad folding caused by the disulfide bond in each monomer of the biotin binding protein which does not form or forms at very low levels in the cytoplasm of . Now the inventors have discovered that correct folding can be achieved by transporting into the periplasmic space of . Thus correct folding of recombinant biotin binding proteins can be improved by replacing the complete native signal sequence of a biotin binding protein with an secretion signal sequence. Without wishing to be bound by a theory this facilitates the translocation of recombinant protein into the periplasmic space of cells. Translocation of recombinant protein into the periplasmic space of then can provide the functionally important disulfide bond in the biotin binding protein e.g. in Rhizavidin and the protein can fold correctly in a soluble form and in high yields.

In one aspect provided herein is a biotin binding protein that can be expressed in a soluble form and high yield in . As used herein the term biotin binding protein refers to a protein which non covalently binds to biotin or an analogue or derivative thereof. High yield means that the protein can be expressed in a soluble form in at an amount of about 10 mg L 11 mg L 12 mg L 13 mg L 14 mg L 15 mg L 20 mg L 25 mg L 30 mg L 35 mg L 30 mg L 35 mg L 40 mg L 45 mg L 50 mg L or more.

In some embodiments the biotin binding protein can be a recombinant protein. The coding sequence for the biotin binding protein can be optimized using expression codons to avoid any difficulty during expression in due to rare codons present in original gene.

Generally the biotin binding protein comprises a biotin binding domain. As used herein a biotin binding domain refers to a polypeptide sequence that binds to biotin. While a complete biotin binding protein can be used as a biotin binding domain only the biotin binding portion of the protein can be used. In some embodiments the biotin binding domain is from Rhizavidin.

In some embodiments the biotin binding domain consists of or consists essentially of the amino acid sequence corresponding to amino acids 45 179 of the wild type Rhizavidin. Amino acid sequence of the wild type Rhizavidin is 

In other words the biotin binding domain does not comprise i.e. lacks lacks amino acids 1 44 MIITSLYATFGTIADGRRTSGGKTMIRTNAVAALVFAVATSALA SEQ ID NO 5 . of the wild type Rhizavidin. In some embodiments the biotin binding domain comprises the amino acid sequence

In some embodiments the biotin binding domain comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 50 identity at least 55 identity at least 60 identity at least 65 identity at least 70 identity at least 75 identity at least 80 identity preferably at least 85 identity at least 90 identity at least 95 identity at least 96 identity at least 97 identity at least 98 identity or at least 99 identity and more preferably at least 99.3 identity to SEQ ID NO 1 .

While Helppolainen et al. Biochem J. 2007 405 397 405 describe removing only first 24 residues of the full length Rhizavidin the inventors have discovered that the first 44 residues of full length Rhizavidin are unnecessary for the core structure and function of Rhizavidin. Further unexpectedly amino acids 25 44 MIRTNAVAALVFAVATSALA SEQ ID NO 6 of the full length Rhizavidin reduce the solubility and secretion of Rhizavidin expressed in as replacement of the first 44 residues of full length Rhizavidin with an signal peptide led to an increase in the solubility and secretion in of biotin proteins described herein.

In the biotin binding protein described herein the biotin binding domain can be extended on the N or C terminus by one or more amino acids with the proviso that the N terminus of the biotin binding domain does not comprise an amino acid sequence corresponding to an amino acid sequence 1 44 of the wild type Rhizavidin. The inventors have discovered that truncating the first 44 amino acids on the N terminus of the wild type Rhizavidin can dramatically increase expression of the biotin binding protein in soluble form in . Thus the biotin binding protein described herein can comprise the sequence X X X wherein Xis a peptide having the amino acid sequence corresponding to amino acids 45 179 of the wild type Rhizavidin and Xand Xare independently absent or a peptide of 1 to about 100 amino acids with the proviso that the N terminus of Xdoes not comprise an amino acid sequence corresponding to N terminus of amino acids 1 44 of the wild type Rhizavidin.

In some embodiments the biotin binding proteins can comprise a signal peptide conjugated to the N terminus of the biotin binding protein i.e. Xcan comprise a signal peptide. The signal peptide is also called a leader peptide in the N terminus which may or may not be cleaved off after the translocation through the membrane. Secretion signal peptides are described in more detail below. In some embodiments the signal sequence is MKKIWLALAGLVLAFSASA SEQ ID NO 2 MAPFEPLASGILLLLWLIAPSRA SEQ ID NO 7 MKKVAAFVALSLLMAGC SEQ ID NO 3 or a derivative or functional portion thereof.

The signal peptide can be linked to the N terminus of the biotin binding domain either directly e.g. via a bond or indirectly e.g. by a linker . In some embodiments the signal peptide can be linked to the N terminus of the biotin binding domain by a peptide linker. The peptide linker sequence can be of any length. For example the peptide linker sequence can be one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen or more amino acids in length. In some embodiments the peptide linker is four amino acids in length.

The peptide linker sequence can comprise any amino acid sequence. For example the peptide linker can comprise an amino acid sequence which can be cleaved by a signal peptidase. In some embodiments the peptide linker comprises the amino acid sequence AQDP SEQ ID NO 8 or VSDP SEQ ID NO 9 .

In the biotin binding protein the biotin binding domain can be conjugated at its C terminus to a peptide of 1 100 amino acids. Such peptides at the C terminus can be used for purification tags linkers to other domains and the like.

In some embodiments the biotin binding protein comprises on its N or C terminus one or more e.g. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten or more purification tags. Examples of purification tags include but are not limited to a histidine tag a c my tag a Halo tag a Flag tag and the like. In some embodiments the biotin binding protein comprises on its C terminus a histidine tag e.g. a His SEQ ID NO. 10 .

A purification tag can be conjugated to the biotin binding protein by a peptide linker to enhance the probability that the tag is exposed to the outside. The length of the linker can be at least one e.g. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen or fifteen amino acid. The linker peptide can comprise any amino acid sequence without limitations. In some embodiments the linker peptide comprises the amino acid sequence VDKLAAALE SEQ ID NO 11 or GGGGSSSVDKLAAALE SEQ ID NO 12 .

In some embodiments the biotin binding protein comprises on its C terminus the amino acid sequence VDKLAAALEHHHHH SEQ ID NO 13 or GGGGSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH SEQ ID NO 14 .

Compared with known biotin binding proteins which form tetramers the biotin binding protein described herein form a dimer. Without wishing to be bound by a theory forming a dimer can further improve expression of the biotin binding protein described herein as a soluble protein in

Although biotin binding proteins are known in the art the biotin binding protein described herein comprises significant differences from avidin and avidin like proteins currently known in the art. First currently known avidins are quite difficult to express as soluble proteins in . However as the inventors have demonstrated the biotin binding protein described herein can be expressed as a soluble protein in in high yield.

The biotin binding proteins described herein can be obtained in a soluble form in high yields e.g. over 30 mg per liter of culture by expression in . Thus the biotin binding proteins described herein are more soluble than those described in the art and reflect underlying differences. Without wishing to be bound by a theory the difference in solubility can be attributed to underlying physical and or chemical and or structural differences between biotin binding proteins described herein and other biotin binding proteins known in the art.

Second the biotin binding protein described herein comprises a biotin binding domain which consists of amino acids 45 179 of wild type Rhizavidin. While wild type Rhizavidin and a partially truncated portion thereof are known in the art there is no teaching or suggestion in the art that a biotin binding protein comprising the amino acids sequence of amino acids 45 179 of wild type Rhizavidin and having an signal sequence would lead to a soluble protein that can be obtained in high yield in . According to Helppolainen et al. Biochem J. 2007 405 397 405 the amino acids 25 44 of the wild type Rhizavidin comprise a putative signal sequence. However as discusses herein the inventors have discovered and demonstrated that replacement of the putative signal sequence with an signal sequence leads to increase in soluble form of the biotin binding protein expression in

Third the biotin binding protein described comprises a peptide of amino acid sequence GGGGSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH SEQ ID NO 14 . This peptide at the C terminus provides a histidine tag for purification and a place for insertion of other domains e.g. antigenic domains in the biotin protein. Further while Helppolainen et al. Biochem J. 2007 405 397 405 describe expression of Rhizavidin in there is no teaching or suggestion in Helppolainen et al. for conjugating an additional peptide to the C terminus of the biotin binding domain of Rhizavidin.

Fourth Rhizavidin has a lower sequence homology to egg avidin 22.4 sequence identity and 35.0 similarity compared with other avidin like proteins. Thus the biotin binding protein described herein is different avidin and other avidin like proteins.

Fifth the biotin binding protein described herein has a low isoelectric point pI compared to the avidin and other avidin like molecules. The isoelectric point of the wild type Rhizavidin is 4.0 Helppolainen et al. Biochem J. 2007 405 397 405 . The isoelectric point of other known biotin binding proteins is generally over 6.1 see Helppolainen et al. Biochem J. 2007 405 397 405 . In comparison the pI of the biotin binding protein described herein is 5.4. The acidic pI of the binding protein described herein leads to reduced non specific binding. A problem in the use of currently known avidin and avidin like peptides is non specific binding thereof. Currently known avidin and avidin like peptides can non specifically bind to not only cells but also DNAs proteins and biological materials such as membranes. For example in detection of a material using the avidin biotin binding avidin non specifically binds to materials other than the object material to be detected to increase the background. One reason for the high non specific binding of avidin include its high isoelectric point. Avidin is a strongly basic protein having a significantly high isoelectric point of 10 or more and is positively charged as a whole. Accordingly it is believed that avidin readily binds to biological materials which are negatively charged in many cases. Thus the low pI of the biotin binding protein described herein is advantageous over the currently known avidin and avidin like peptides.

Sixth size of the biotin binding protein described herein is a relatively small compared to currently known avidin and avidin like proteins. The biotin binding protein is smaller than 28 kDa dimer size . However most of the currently known avidin and avidin like proteins all have sizes larger than 60 kDa tetramer size . Wild type Rhizavidin is said to be about 29 kDa dimer size in size. Small size of the biotin binding protein can be used to increase loading of binding conjugation between molecules interest. For example the biotin binding protein can be used to conjugate first molecule of interest with a second molecule of interest. One of the molecules of interest can be linked to one or more biotin or biotin like molecules and the second molecule can be linked conjugated or fused to the biotin binding protein. Given the small size of the biotin protein described herein the biotin or biotin like molecules can be spaced closer together on the to permit binding of more relative to if the second molecule was a larger currently known avidin or avidin like molecule.

Seventh the biotin binding protein described herein is a dimer. Forming a dimer can further improve expression of the biotin binding protein described herein as a soluble protein in . Additionally because the biotin binding protein forms a dimer rather than tetramer like all other known avidin like proteins 1 the structural complexity of the fusion antigens is reduced 2 the difficulty of expressing recombinant biotin binding protein fusion proteins is similarly reduced 3 the steric hindrance of manipulations of biotin binding protein fusions is minimized which is advantageous for further manipulations with for example but not limited to biotin biotin mimetics or biotin derivatives and 4 solubility of biotin binding protein fusions is greatly enhanced. Thus demonstrating underlying differences between the biotin binding proteins described herein and those known in the art.

Eighth the biotin binding protein described herein reduces the risk of an immunogenic composition comprising the same inducing an egg related allergic reaction in a subject. Moreover antibody to biotin binding domain described herein has no apparent cross reactivity to egg avidin and vice versa .

Further a biotin binding protein described herein can have improved properties such as a reduction in non specific binding or a further improvement in biotin binding while retaining the characteristics of wild type Rhizavidin. The use of the biotin binding protein described herein for detection for example in immunoassay or nucleic acid hybridization assay for measuring an analyte utilizing avidin biotin binding can reduce background increase sensitivity and maintain the binding property with biotin in severe conditions.

This study clearly demonstrates the advantages and differences of the biotin binding proteins described herein over avidin and other avidin like proteins. Thus the biotin binding proteins described herein have a potential as a powerful and versatile tool in a wide range of applications utilizing avidin biotin technology.

Without limitations a biotin binding protein can be used in any methodology composition or system requiring the use of an avidin biotin system. As one of ordinary skill is well aware the avidin biotin system can be used for numerous laboratory methods such as bioconjugation target molecule detection target molecule isolation purification or enrichment from a sample protein detection nucleic acid detection protein isolation purification or enrichment nucleic acid isolation purification or enrichment ELISA flow cytometry and the like.

Accordingly exemplary uses for the recombinant biotin binding proteins described herein include but are not limited to bioconjugation target molecule detection target molecule isolation purification or enrichment from a sample protein detection nucleic acid detection protein isolation purification or enrichment nucleic acid isolation purification or enrichment ELISA flow cytometry and the like.

In some embodiments the biotin binding protein described herein can be used as part of the affinity pair in the multiple antigen presenting system MAPS as described in U.S. Provisional application No. 61 48 934 filed May 11 2012 No. 61 608 168 filed Mar. 8 2012 and No. 61 609 974 filed Mar. 13 2012 and PCT application no. PCT US12 37412 filed May 11 2012 content of all of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. MAPS is also described in more detail herein below. Without wishing to be bound by a theory use of a biotin binding protein described herein reduces the risk of the MAPS inducing an egg related allergic reaction in a subject. Moreover antibody to recombinant modified Rhizavidin has no apparent cross reactivity to egg avidin and vice versa .

In another aspect provided herein is a lipidated biotin binding protein. As used herein the term lipidated biotin binding protein refers to a biotin binding protein that is covalently conjugated with a lipid. The lipid moieties could be a diacyl or triacyl lipid.

The lipidated biotin binding protein can be made using a lipidation sequence. As used herein the term lipidation sequence refers to an amino acid sequence that facilitates lipidation in a bacteria e.g. of a polypeptide carrying the lipidating sequence. The lipidation sequence can be present at the N terminus or the C terminus of the protein. The lipidation sequence can be linked to the recombinant biotin binding protein to form a fusion protein which is in lipidated form when expressed in by conventional recombinant technology. In some embodiments a lipidation sequence is located at the N terminus of the biotin binding protein.

Any lipidation sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art can be used. In some embodiments the lipidating sequence is MKKVAAFVALSLLMAGC SEQ ID NO 3 or a derivative or functional portion thereof. Other exemplary lididationg sequences include but are not limited to MNSKKLCCICVLFSLLAGCAS SEQ ID NO 16 MRYSKLTMLIPCALLLSAC SEQ ID NO 17 MFVTSKKMTAAVLAITLAMSLSAC SEQ ID NO 18 MIKRVLVVSMVGLSLVGC SEQ ID NO 19 and derivatives or functional portions thereof.

In some embodiments the lipidation sequence can be fused to the biotin binding protein via a peptide linker wherein the peptide linker attaches the lipidating sequence to the biotin binding protein.

The lipidated biotin binding proteins are ligands for Toll Like Receptors TLRs . As such the lipidated biotin binding proteins described herein can be used as TLR ligands. For example the lipidated biotin binding protein can be used in compositions to induce TLR2 stimulation. This can be useful for inducing immunogenicity to other antigens pathogens. Thus the biotin binding lipoproteins can be used in immunogenic compositions as a co stimulation factor or adjuvant for an antigen.

As used herein the term Toll Like Receptor is meant to refer in general to any Toll like receptor of any species of organism. A TLR can be from any mammalian species. TLRs have been identified in various mammalian species including but not limited to for example humans guinea pigs and mice. A specific TLR can be identified with additional reference to species of origin e.g. human murine etc. . . . a particular receptor e.g. TLR2 TLR3 TLR9 etc. . . . or both. In some embodiments the lipidated biotin binding protein is a ligand for TLR2.

Toll like receptors TLRs are a family of germline encoded transmembrane proteins that facilitate pathogen recognition and activation of the innate immune system. Toll like receptors TLRs are pattern recognition receptors PRRs and are expressed by cells of the innate immune system including macrophages dendritic cells and NK cells. Examples of known ligands for TLRs include gram positive bacteria TLR 2 bacterial endotoxin TLR 4 flagellin protein TLR 5 bacterial DNA TLR 9 double stranded RNA and poly I C TLR 3 and yeast TLR 2 . Other ligands that bind an endocytic pattern recognition receptor a scavenger receptor or a mannose binding receptor can also be contemplated by the instant invention. TLRs engage conserved pathogen derived ligands and subsequently activate the TLR IL 1R signal transduction pathway to induce a variety of effector genes. Toll like receptors TLRs represent an important group of PRRs that can sense pathogen or microbe associated molecular patterns. They are widely expressed in blood spleen lung muscle and intestines by many types of cells notably dendritic cells DCs but also macrophages epithelial cells and lymphocytes.

Whereas some TLRs located on the cell surface are specific for microbial lipids and proteins others associated with endosomal compartments inside cells are specific for nucleic acids. Ligation of the TLRs by their specific ligands results in conformational changes in the receptors leading to downstream signal transduction that primarily involves MyD88 and TRIF dependent pathways. Except for TLR3 all other TLRs can signal through the MyD88 pathway to induce pro inflammatory cytokines that involve activation of intracellular protein kinase cascades including IB kinase IKK NF B and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase ERK c Jun N terminal kinase JNK and p38 mitogen activation protein kinases MAPKs . The TRIF pathway independent of MyD88 is utilized by both TLR3 and TLR4 and mediates the induction of type I interferons.

The recombinant biotin binding lipoproteins described herein have enhanced immunogenicity. Without wishing to be bound by a theory lipid moieties at the N terminals of the lipoproteins or lipopeptides contribute to the adjuvant activity. Accordingly additional embodiments provide immunogenic or vaccine compositions for inducing an immunological response comprising the isolated biotin binding lipoprotein or a suitable vector for in vivo expression thereof or both and a suitable carrier as well as to methods for eliciting an immunological or protective response comprising administering to a host the isolated recombinant biotin binding lipoprotein the vector expressing the recombinant biotin binding lipoprotein or a composition containing the recombinant lipoprotein or vector in an amount sufficient to elicit the response.

An immunological or immunogenic composition comprising the biotin binding lipoprotein elicits an immunological response local or systemic. The response can but need not be protective. It is to be noted that as used herein the terms immunological composition and immunogenic composition include a vaccine composition as the two former terms can be protective compositions . Without limitations a lipidated biotin binding protein described herein can be used as an antigen adjuvant or a co stimulator in an immunological immunogenic or vaccine composition. Further since the lipidated biotin binding protein comprises a biotin binding domain the lipidated protein can be assembled to the polymer backbone of the MAPS. Accordingly provided herein are also methods of inducing an immunological response in a host mammal. The method comprising administering to the host an immunogenic immunological or vaccine composition comprising a lipidated biotin binding protein described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

In some embodiments the lipidated biotin binding protein is a fusion protein comprising a lipidated biotin binding protein and a protein or peptide.

Hemolysins are exotoxins produced by bacteria that cause lysis of red blood cells. While highly immunogenic their use in vaccines is limited because they cause lysis of red blood cells. Accordingly in another aspect provided herein are variants of staphylococcal alpha hemolysin Hla its fusion construct with biotin binding protein and its uses. These variants designated herein as mHla have substantially non hemolytic i.e. have substantially low hemolytic activity. As used herein the phrase substantially non hemolytic means an inability to lyse red blood cells at equivalent titers of wild type Hla. The term wild type Hla is accorded the usual definition associated with such phrase i.e. Hla that is naturally secreted by a capable bacterial source. Wild type Hla by definition does not include e.g. Hla fusion products derived via recombinant DNA techniques. In some embodiments hemolytic activity of mHla is at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 20 at least 30 at least 30 at least 35 least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 lower than an equivalent titers of wild type Hla. In some embodiments the mHla has no detectable hemolytic activity. The inventors have also discovered that hemolytic activity of mHla can be further reduced by linking the mHla with a biotin binding protein. Accordingly the present disclosure also describes fusion proteins comprising a mHla protein and a biotin binding protein.

As provided herein a non hemolytic Hla can be created wherein residue W205 or W213 is substituted with alanine A or the tripeptide DRD209 211 is substituted with a tri alanine peptide AAA in the wild type Hla. The mutated Hla protein can be expressed and purified in an expression system. The mutants can be made by point mutation using quick change mutagenesis. For example the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid encoding the wild type Hla can be changed to replace a given amino acid in the wild type Hla to another amino acid.

In some embodiments the mHla is a fusion protein comprising the mHla and a biotin binding protein. In some embodiments the biotin binding mHla fusion protein comprises the amino acid sequence

The Hla variants described herein are ligands for Toll Like Receptors TLRs . As such the Hla variants described herein can be used as TLR ligands. For example the Hla variants can be used in compositions to induce TLR2 stimulation. This can be useful for inducing immunogenicity to other antigens pathogens. Thus the Hla variants described herein can be used in immunogenic compositions as a co stimulation factor or adjuvant for an antigen. Further when the mHla is fused with a biotin binding protein the fusion protein can be conjugated to the polymer backone of the MAPS.

In some embodiments the mHla can be used as a co stimulatory factor in an immunogenic or vaccine composition.

Further since the mHla induce an immune response in the subject the mHla can be used as in an immunogenic or vaccine composition for vaccinating a subject against

The mHla described herein have enhanced immunogenicity. Accordingly additional embodiments provide immunogenic or vaccine compositions for inducing an immunological response comprising the mHla or a suitable vector for in vivo expression thereof or both and a suitable carrier as well as to methods for eliciting an immunological or protective response comprising administering to a host the isolated mHla the vector expressing the mHla or a composition containing the mHla or vector in an amount sufficient to elicit the response.

An immunological or immunogenic composition comprising the mHla can elicit an immunological response local or systemic. The response can but need not be protective. Accordingly a non hemolytic mutant of Hla described herein can be as an antigen adjuvant or a co stimulator in an immunological immunogenic or vaccine composition.

Further provided herein are also methods of inducing an immunological response in a host mammal. The method comprising administering to the host an immunogenic immunological or vaccine composition comprising a non hemolytic mutant of Hla described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

In another aspect provided herein are fusion proteins comprising a biotin binding protein described herein linked to an antigenic protein or peptide. These fusion proteins are also referred to as biotin binding fusion proteins and as antigen fusion proteins herein. The biotin binding protein and the antigenic protein or peptide can be linked in any configuration e.g. biotin binding protein can in the N terminal and the antigenic peptide in the C terminal of the fusion protein or vice versa.

In some embodiments the biotin binding protein and the antigenic protein or peptide are linked to each other by a peptide linker. Without limitations the peptide linker can comprise any amino acid sequence and can be of any length. For example the peptide linker sequence can be one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen or more amino acids in length. In some embodiments the peptide linker linking the antigen domain to the biotin binding domain is eight amino acids in length.

In some embodiments the peptide linker linking the antigen domain to the biotin binding domain has the amino acids sequence GGGGSSS SEQ ID NO 22 .

In some embodiments the non hemolytic Hla protein is a fusion protein comprising a biotin binding protein and a non hemolytic Hla described herein.

In some embodiments the non hemolytic Hla protein is a fusion protein comprising a lipidated biotin binding protein and a non hemolytic Hla described herein.

In another aspect provided herein are immunogenic compositions comprising an antigen fusion protein a lipidated biotin binding or a non hemolytic variant of Hla described herein. In addition provided herein are also immunogenic compositions and vaccine compositions comprising an immunogenic complex that comprises at least one antigen fusion protein or multiple antigen fusion proteins attached to a polymer scaffold for use in eliciting an immune response to each of the antigens attached to the polymer and optionally to the polymer itself when administered to a subject. Without wishing to be bound by a theory the immunogenic composition described herein stimulates a humoral and cellular immune response it can generate antibody and the Th1 Th17 responses to multiple protein antigens using a single MAPS immunogenic construct. A combination of B and T cell immunity to the organism represents an optimal vaccine strategy against many diseases including pneumococcal disease associated invasive infection and nasopharyngeal carriage.

In some embodiments an immunogenic composition as disclosed herein further comprises at least one co stimulation factor associated with the polymer or polysaccharide where the co stimulation factor can be associated directly or indirectly. For example in some embodiment a co stimulation factor can be covalently attached to the polymer. For example in some embodiments a co stimulation factor can be covalently attached to the first affinity molecule which is then cross linked to the polymer. For example in some embodiments a co stimulation factor can be attached to a complementary affinity molecule which associates with a first affinity molecule to link the co stimulator factor to the polymer. In some embodiments a co stimulation factor is an adjuvant. In alternative embodiments a co stimulatory factor can be any known to one of ordinary skill in the art and includes any combination for example without limitation Toll like receptor agonists agonists for TLR2 3 4 5 7 8 9 etc. NOD agonists or agonists of the inflammasome.

In some embodiments the co stimulatory factor can be a lipidated biotin binding protein or a non hemolytic variant of alpha hemolysin or the fusion protein of mHla with biotin binding protein described herein.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the immunogenic composition as disclosed herein to be administered to a subject to elicit an immune response in the subject. In some embodiments the immune response is an antibody B cell response a CD4T cell response including Th1 Th2 and Th17 cells and or a CD8T cell response. In some embodiments at least one adjuvant is administered in conjunction with the immunogenic composition.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for inducing an immune response in a subject to at least one antigen comprising administering to the subject the immunogenic composition as disclosed herein.

In all aspects as disclosed herein an immune response is an antibody B cell response a CD4T cell response including Th1 Th2 and Th17 responses or a CD8 T cell response against protein peptide antigen s . In some embodiments an immune response is an antibody B cell response against the polymer e.g. a pneumococcal polysaccharide. In some embodiments at least one adjuvant is administered in conjunction with the immunogenic composition.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the immunogenic composition as disclosed herein for use in a diagnostic for exposure to a pathogen or immunogenic agent.

Also provided herein is also an immunogenic multiple antigen presenting system MAPS useful for the production of immunogenic compositions such as those useful in vaccines. In particular the present invention relates to compositions comprising an immunogenic complex comprising at least one type of polymer e.g. a polysaccharide that can optionally be antigenic at least one antigenic protein or peptide and at least one complementary affinity molecule pair comprising i a first affinity molecule that associates with the polymer and ii a complementary affinity molecule that associates with the protein or peptide such that the first and complementary affinity molecules serve as an indirect link between the polymer with the antigenic protein or peptide. Accordingly the polymer can attach at least 1 or at least 2 or a plurality of the same or different protein or peptide antigens. In some embodiments the polymer is antigenic e.g. the polymer is a pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide. In some embodiments the protein or peptide antigens are recombinant protein or peptide antigens.

The immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein can elicit both humoral and cellular responses to one or multiple antigens at the same time. The immunogenic compositions provide for a long lasting memory response potentially protecting a subject from future infection. This allows for a single immunogenic composition that raises a high titer of functional anti polysaccharide antibody and is similar or compares favorably with the antibody level induced by conventional conjugate vaccine. Moreover there is no restriction to specific carrier protein and various antigen proteins can be used in MAPS construct to generate a robust anti polysaccharide antibody response.

Additionally the strong antibody response and Th17 Th1 responses are specific to multiple protein antigens presented via the MAPS composition. This presents a major advantage as a means for eliciting two forms of immunity with one construct. In addition to a more conventional immune response to an antigenic polysaccharide conjugated to a protein carrier the present invention provides for a T cell response and more specifically Th17 and Th1 responses to proteins injected systemically. Moreover the present immunogenic composition can incorporate ligands onto the polymer backbone. This provides a potential to enhance specific B cell or T cell responses by modifying protein polymer ratio complex size or by incorporating specific co stimulatory factor such as TLR2 4 ligands etc. into the composition.

Compared with typical conjugation technology which involves harsh treatment of proteins the present methods avoid risk of denaturation of other modification of the peptide antigen. This provides a substantial advantage of preserving the antigenicity of the included proteins and increases the probability that the protein itself will serve as an antigen rather than just a carrier . Similarly the present methods avoid unnecessary modification damage of the polysaccharide backbone because there is no heavy chemical cross linking biotinylation can be precisely controlled to react with specific functional groups of the polysaccharide and the biotinylation level can be easily adjusted. This is advantageous in avoiding the typical process of conjugation that results in damage to critical side chains or epitopes which may cause reduced immunogenicity and protection.

The present the affinity based assembly provides easy and highly flexible preparation of the immunogenic composition. It is highly specific and stable it can remain in the cold for months and retain its potency. The assembly process is simple enough to ensure high reproducibility there are only a few steps required which reduces the risk of lot to lot variation of great industrial advantage. The MAPS assembly is highly efficient over 95 even at low concentrations of protein and polysaccharide such as 0.1 mg ml this is a major advantage because inefficiencies in conjugate manufacture typically efficiencies are in the

The MAPS is a flexible and versatile composition that can be designed and manufactured to elicit a particular broad spectrum or variety of antigenic targets. Table 1 provides a simple example guide for envisioning the flexibility of MAPS embodiments 

One component of MAP consists of a backbone typically a polymer. The polymer may be antigenic or non antigenic. It can be made of a wide variety on substances as described herein with the caveat that the polymer serves as a means of presenting the associated antigen s to the immune system in immunogenic fashion. In some embodiments the polymer is a synthetic polymer. In some embodiments the polymer is a naturally occurring polymer e.g. a polysaccharide derived or purified from bacterial cells.

Influenza vaccines are used routinely in humans and include vaccines derived from inactivated whole influenza virus live attenuated influenza virus or purified and inactivated materials from viral strains. For example a traditional influenza vaccine can be manufactured using three potentially threatening strains of flu virus. These strains are usually grown in fertilized chicken eggs which requires extensive processing including egg inoculation and incubation egg harvest virus purification and inactivation processing and pooling the virus or viral components to the final vaccine formulation and aseptic filling in the appropriate containers. Typically this egg based production cycle takes over 70 weeks. In the event of a major influenza epidemic the availability of a potent and safe vaccine is a major concern. Additionally there are risks associated with impurities in eggs such as antibiotics and contaminants that negatively impact vaccine sterility. Moreover egg derived flu vaccines are contraindicated for those with severe allergies to egg proteins and people with a history of Guillain Barr syndrome. The present invention provides an alternative to the egg based influenza vaccines not only be avoiding egg related selequae but be providing a platform for the use of multiple influenza antigens in a highly controlled platform.

In some embodiments an antigen for use in the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein can also include those used in biological warfare such as ricin which may provoke a CMI response.

Additionally the present invention also provides immunogenic compositions comprising antigens which raise an immune response against cancer. In these conjugates an antigen is an antigen expressed by a cancer or tumor or derived from a tumor. In some embodiments such antigens are referred to herein as a cancer antigen and are typically a protein expressed predominantly on the cancer cells such that the conjugate elicits both potent humoral and potent cellular immunity to this protein. A large number of cancer associated antigens have been identified several of which are now being used to make experimental cancer treatment vaccines and are thus suitable for use in the present embodiments. Antigens associated with more than one type of cancer include Carcinoembryonic antigen CEA Cancer testis antigens such as NY ESO 1 Mucin 1 MUC1 such as Sialyl Tn STn Gangliosides such as GM3 and GD2 p53 protein and HER2 neu protein also known as ERBB2 . Antigens unique to a specific type of cancer include a mutant form of the epidermal growth factor receptor called EGFRvIII Melanocyte melanoma differentiation antigens such as tyrosinase MART1 gp100 the lineage related cancer testis group MAGE and tyrosinase related antigens Prostate specific antigen Leukaemia associated antigens LAAs such as the fusion protein BCR ABL Wilms tumour protein and proteinase 3 and Idiotype Id antibodies. See e.g. Mitchell 3 Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs 150 2002 Dao Scheinberg 21 Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 391 2008 .

Another approach in generating an immune response against cancer employs antigens from microbes that cause or contribute to the development of cancer. These vaccines have been used against cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus lymphoma and nasoparyngeal carcinoma Epstei Barr virus colorectal cancer stomach cancer bladder cancer T cell leukemia human T cell lymphtropic virus cervical cancer human papillomavirus and others. To date there have been clinical trials for vaccines targeting Bladder Cancer Brain Tumors Breast Cancer Cervical Cancer Kidney Cancer Melanoma Multiple Myeloma Leukemia Lung Cancer Pancreatic Cancer Prostate Cancer and Solid Tumors.

In some embodiments an antigen for use in the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein can include antigens of autoimmune diseases e.g. they can be self antigens. Autoimmune diseases contemplated for diagnosis according to the assays described herein include but are not limited to alopecia areata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome Addison s disease aplastic anemia multiple sclerosis autoimmune disease of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis Behcet s Disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy celiac sprue dermatitis chronic fatigue syndrome chronic inflammatory demyelinating syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory polyncuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatricial pemphigoid CREST Syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease dermatitis herpetiformis discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia glomerulonephritis Grave s disease Guillain Barre Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA nephropathy insulin dependent diabetes Type I Lichen Planus lupus Meniere s Disease mixed connective tissue disease myasthenia gravis myocarditis pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis Raynaud s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome rheumatic fever rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sjogren s syndrome stiff man syndrome Takayasu arteritis temporal arteritis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis uveitis Wegener s syndrome vasculitis and vitiligo. It is generally important to assess the potential or actual CMI responsiveness in subjects having or suspected of having or being susceptible to an autoimmune disease.

In some embodiments an antigen for use in the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein can be an antigen which is associated with an inflammatory disease or condition. Examples of inflammatory disease conditions where antigens may be useful include but are not limited to acne angina arthritis aspiration pneumonia empyema gastroenteritis necrotizing enterocolitis pelvic inflammatory disease pharyngitis pleurisy chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy among others.

In some embodiments an antigen can be an intact i.e. an entire or whole antigen or a functional portion of an antigen that comprises more than one epitope. In some embodiments an antigen is a peptide functional portion of an antigen. By intact in this context is meant that the antigen is the full length antigen as that antigen polypeptide occurs in nature. This is in direct contrast to delivery of only a small portion or peptide of the antigen. Delivering an intact antigen to a cell enables or facilitates eliciting an immune response to a full range of epitopes of the intact antigen rather than just a single or selected few peptide epitopes. Accordingly the methods and immunogenic compositions described herein encompass intact antigens associated with the polymer for a more sensitive and have higher specificity of immune response as compared to use of a single epitope peptide based antigen.

Alternatively in some embodiments an intact antigen can be divided into many parts depending on the size of the initial antigen. Typically where a whole antigen is a multimer polypeptide the whole protein can be divided into sub units and or domains where each individual sub unit or domain of the antigen can be associated with the polymer according to the methods as disclosed herein. Alternatively in some embodiments an intact antigen can be divided into functional fragments or parts of the whole antigen for example at least two or at least 3 or at least 4 or at least 5 or at least 6 or at least 7 or at least 8 or at least 9 or at least 10 or at least 11 or at least 12 or at least 13 or at least 15 or at least 20 or at least 25 or more than 25 portions e.g. pieces or fragments inclusive and where each individual functional fragment of the antigen can be associated with the polymer according to the methods as disclosed herein.

The fragmentation or division of a full length antigen polypeptide can be an equal division of the full length antigen polypeptide or alternatively in some embodiments the fragmentation is asymmetrical or unequal. As a non limiting example where an antigen is divided into two overlapping fragments an antigen can be divided into fragments of approximately the same equal size or alternatively one fragment can be about 45 of the whole antigen and the other fragment can be about 65 . As further non limiting examples a whole antigen can be divided into a combination of differently sized fragments for example where an antigen is divided into two fragments fragments can be divided into about 40 and about 70 or about 45 and about 65 or about 35 and about 75 or about 25 and about 85 inclusive of the whole antigen. Any combination of overlapping fragments of a full length whole antigen is encompassed for use in the generation of a panel of overlapping polypeptides of an antigen. As an illustrative example only where a antigen is divided into 5 portions the portions can divided equally i.e. each overlapping fragment is about 21 to 25 of the entire full length if the antigen or unequally i.e. an antigen can be divided into the following five overlapping fragments fragment 1 is about 25 fragment 2 is about 5 fragment 3 is about 35 fragment 4 is about 10 and fragment 5 is about 25 of the size of the full length antigen provided each fragment overlaps with at least one other fragment .

Typically a panel of antigen portions can substantially cover the entire length of the whole or intact antigen polypeptide. Accordingly in some embodiments an immunogenic composition comprises a polymer with many different and or overlapping fragments of the same intact antigen. Overlapping protein fragments of a antigen can be produced much quicker and cheaper and with increased stability as compared to the use of peptide antigens alone. Further in some embodiments antigens which are polypeptides larger than simple peptides are preferred as conformation is important for epitope recognition and the larger antigen polypeptides or fragments will provide a benefit over peptide fragments.

One of ordinary skill in the art can divide a whole antigen into overlapping proteins of an antigen to create a panel of polypeptides of the antigen. By way of an illustrative example only the TB specific antigen TB 1 CFP also known as culture filtrate 10 or CFP 10 can be divided into for example at least seventeen portions to generate a panel of seventeen different polypeptides each comprising a different but overlapping TB specific antigen TBI CFP fragment. Culture filtrate protein CFP 10 Genbank AAC83445 is a 10 kDa 100 amino acid residue protein fragment from . It is also known as L45 antigen homologous protein LHP .

A target antigen for use in the methods and compositions described herein can be expressed by recombinant means and can optionally include an affinity or epitope tag to facilitate purification which methods are well known in the art. Chemical synthesis of an oligopeptide either free or conjugated to carrier proteins can be used to obtain antigen of the invention. Oligopeptides are considered a type of polypeptide. An antigen can be expressed as a fusion with a complementary affinity molecule e.g. but not limited to rhizavidin or a derivative or functional fragment thereof. Alternatively it is also possible to prepare target antigen and then conjugate it to a complementary affinity molecule e.g. but not limited to rhizavidin or a derivative or functional fragment thereof.

Polypeptides can also by synthesized as branched structures such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 229 490 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 390 111. Antigenic polypeptides include for example synthetic or recombinant B cell and T cell epitopes universal T cell epitopes and mixed T cell epitopes from one organism or disease and B cell epitopes from another.

An antigen can obtained through recombinant means or chemical polypeptide synthesis as well as antigen obtained from natural sources or extracts can be purified by means of the antigen s physical and chemical characteristics such as by fractionation or chromatography. These techniques are well known in the art.

In some embodiments an antigen can be solubilized in water a solvent such as methanol or a buffer. Suitable buffers include but are not limited to phosphate buffered saline Ca Mg free PBS normal saline 150 mM NaCl in water and Tris buffer. Antigen not soluble in neutral buffer can be solubilized in 10 mM acetic acid and then diluted to the desired volume with a neutral buffer such as PBS. In the case of antigen soluble only at acid pH acetate PBS at acid pH can be used as a diluent after solubilization in dilute acetic acid. Glycerol can be a suitable non aqueous solvent for use the compositions methods and kits described herein.

Typically when designing a protein vaccine against a pathogen an extracellular protein or one exposed to the environment on a virus is often the ideal candidate as the antigen component in the vaccine. Antibodies generated against that extracellular protein become the first line of defense against the pathogen during infection. The antibodies bind to the protein on the pathogen to facilitate antibody opsonization and mark the pathogen for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte such as a macrophage. Antibody opsonization can also kill the pathogen by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The antibody triggers a release of lysis products from cells such as monocytes neutrophils eosinophils and natural killer cells.

In one embodiment of the invention described herein antigens for use in the compositions as disclosed herein all wild type proteins as in the amino acid residues have the sequences found in naturally occurring viruses and have not been altered by selective growth conditions or molecular biological methods.

In one embodiment the immunogenic compositions described as herein can comprise antigens which are glycosylated proteins. In other words an antigen of interest can each be a glycosylated protein. In one embodiment of the immunogenic compositions as described herein antigens or antigen fusion polypeptides are O linked glycosylated. In another embodiment of the immunogenic compositions as described herein antigens or antigen fusion polypeptides are N linked glycosylated. In yet another embodiment of the immunogenic compositions as described herein antigens or antigen fusion are both O linked and N linked glycosylated. In other embodiments other types of glycosylations are possible e.g. C mannosylation. Glycosylation of proteins occurs predominantly in eukaryotic cells. N glycosylation is important for the folding of some eukaryotic proteins providing a co translational and post translational modification mechanism that modulates the structure and function of membrane and secreted proteins. Glycosylation is the enzymatic process that links saccharides to produce glycans and attaches them to proteins and lipids. In N glycosylation glycans are attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine side chain during protein translation. The three major saccharides forming glycans are glucose mannose and N acetylglucosamine molecules. The N glycosylation consensus is Asn Xaa Ser Thr where Xaa can be any of the known amino acids. O linked glycosylation occurs at a later stage during protein processing probably in the Golgi apparatus. In O linked glycosylation N acetyl galactosamine O fucose O glucose and or N acetylglucosamine is added to serine or threonine residues. One skilled in the art can use bioinformatics software such as NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc Prediction softwares from the Technical University of Denmark to find the N and O glycosylation sites in a polypeptide in the present invention. The NetNglyc server predicts N Glycosylation sites in proteins using artificial neural networks that examine the sequence context of Asn Xaa Ser Thr sequons. The NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc 3.1 Prediction software can be accessed at the EXPASY website. In one embodiment N glycosylation occurs in the target antigen polypeptide of the fusion polypeptide described herein.

As disclosed herein in some embodiments an antigen is connected to a polymer via complementary affinity pairs. This connecting of the antigen to the polymer is mediated by the polymer being connected to a first affinity molecule which associates a second e.g. complementary affinity molecule which is attached to the antigen. An example complementary affinity pair is biotin biotin binding protein.

Exemplary examples of the affinity complementary affinity pairs include but without limitation biotin binding proteins or avidin like proteins that bind to biotin. For example where the first affinity binding molecule is biotin which associates with the polymer the complementary affinity molecule can be a biotin binding protein or an avidin like protein or a derivative thereof e.g. but not limited to avidin rhizavidin or streptavidin or variants derivatives or functional portions thereof.

In some embodiments the first affinity binding molecule is biotin a biotin derivative or a biotin mimic for example but not limited to amine PEG3 biotin biotinylation 3 6 9 trixaundecanediamine or a derivative or functional fragment thereof. A specific biotin mimetic has a specific peptide motif containing sequence of DXAXPX SEQ ID NO 39 or CDXAXPXCG SEQ ID NO 40 where Xis R or L Xis S or T and Xis Y or W. These motifs can bind avidin and Neutravidin but streptavidin. See e.g. Gaj et al. 56 Prot. Express. Purif. 54 2006 .

The linkage of the first affinity molecule to the polymer and the complementary affinity molecule to the antigen can be a non covalent linkage or a chemical mechanism for instance covalent binding affinity binding intercalation coordinate binding and complexation. Covalent binding provides for very stable binding and is particularly well suited for the present embodiments. Covalent binding can be achieved either by direct condensation of existing side chains or by the incorporation of external bridging molecules.

For example in some embodiments an antigen can be non covalently bonded to one of the pairs in a complementary affixing pair. In alternative embodiments an antigen can be covalently bonded or fused to one of the pairs in a complementary affixing pair. Methods for generation of fusion proteins are well known in the art and are discussed herein.

In other embodiments a first affinity binding molecule is linked to the polymer by a non covalent bond or by a covalent bond. In some embodiments a cross linking reagent is used to covalently bond the first affinity binding molecule to the polymer as disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the first affinity binding molecule associates with the complementary affinity molecule by non covalent bond association as known in the art including but not limited to electrostatic interaction hydrogen bound hydrophobic interaction i.e. van der Waals forces hydrophilic interactions and other non covalent interactions. Other higher order interactions with intermediate moieties are also contemplated.

In some embodiments the complementary affinity molecule is an avidin related polypeptide. In specific embodiments the complementary affinity molecule is rhizavidin such as recombinant rhizavidin. In particular the recombinant rhizavidin is a modified rhizavidin that can be expressed in with a high yield. The typical yield is 30 mg per liter of culture. Rhizavidin has a lower sequence homology to egg avidin 22.4 sequence identity and 35.0 similarity compared with other avidin like proteins. Use of the modified rhizavidin reduces the risk of the MAPS inducing an egg related allergic reaction in a subject. Moreover antibody to recombinant modified rhizavidin has no apparent cross reactivity to egg avidin and vice versa .

More specifically some embodiments comprise a modified rhizavidin designed for recombinant expression in . The coding sequence for the rhizavidin gene was optimized using expression codons to avoid any difficulty during expression in due to rare codons present in original gene. To simplify the construct after a bioinformatics and structure based analysis the first 44 residues of full length rhizavidin were removed as these were found to be unnecessary for the core structure and function. The correct folding of recombinant protein was improved by added an secretion signal sequence to the N terminal of the shortened rhizavidin 45 179 to facilitate the translocation of recombinant protein into the periplasmic space of cells where the functionally important disulfide bond in rhizavidin can form correctly. The modified recombinant rhizavidin forms a dimer compared with known avidin like proteins which form tetramers further improving expression of the recombinant rhizavidin antigen fusion as a soluble protein in

Moreover as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein to improve the expression and solubility of fusion antigens in a flexible linker region was added between rhizavidin and the antigen protein. Additionally based on the bioinformatics and structural analysis different antigen constructs were cloned and expressed either full length antigen or the important functional domain or chimera proteins were comprising with two different antigens.

Additional affinity pairs that may be useful in the methods and compositions described herein include antigen antibody metal ion metal ion binding protein lipid lipid binding protein saccharide saccharide binding protein amino acid peptide amino acid or peptide binding protein enzyme substrate or enzyme inhibitor ligand agonist receptor or biotin mimetic. When using alternative affinity pairs alternative means of attaching the respective polymer and antigen may also be employed such as in vitro enzymatic reactions rather than genetic fusion. More specifically antigen antibody affinity pair provides for a very strong and specific interaction. The antigen can be any epitope including protein peptide nucleic acid lipid poly oligosaccharide ion etc. The antibody can be any type of immunoglobulin or the Ag binding portion of an immunoglobulin such as a Fab fragment. Regarding metal ion metal ion binding protein examples include Ni NTA vs. histidine tagged protein or Zn vs. Zn binding protein. Regarding lipid lipid binding protein examples include cholesterol vs. cholesterol binding protein. Regarding saccharide saccharide binding protein examples include maltose vs. maltose binding protein mannose glucose oligosaccharide vs. lectin. Enzyme substrate inhibitors include substrates from a wide range of substances including protein peptide amino acid lipid sugar or ions. The inhibitor can be the analog of the real substrate which can generally bind to the enzymes more tightly and even irreversibly. For example trypsin vs. soy trypsin inhibitor. The inhibitor can be natural or synthetic molecule. Regarding other ligand agonist receptor ligand can be from a wide range of substance including protein peptide amino acid lipid sugar ion agonist can be the analog of the real ligand. Examples include the LPS vs. TLR4 interaction.

Many bivalent or polyvalent linking agents are useful in coupling protein molecules to other molecules. For example representative coupling agents can include organic compounds such as thioesters carbodiimides succinimide esters disocyanates glutaraldehydes diazobenzenes and hexamethylene diamines. This listing is not intended to be exhaustive of the various classes of coupling agents known in the art but rather is exemplary of the more common coupling agents. See Killen Lindstrom 133 J. Immunol. 1335 1984 Jansen et al. 62 Imm. Rev. 185 1982 Vitetta et al.

In some embodiments cross linking reagents agents described in the literature are encompassed for use in the methods immunogenic compositions and kits as disclosed herein. See e.g. Ramakrishnan et al. 44 Cancer Res. 201 1984 describing the use of MBS M maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester Umemoto et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 030 719 describing the use of a halogenated acetyl hydrazide derivative coupled to an antibody by way of an oligopeptide linker . Particular linkers include a EDC 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylamino propyl carbodiimide hydrochloride b SMPT 4 succinimidyloxycarbonyl alpha methyl alpha 2 pyridyl dithio toluene Pierce Chem. Co. Cat. 21558G c SPDP succinimidyl 6 3 2 pyridyldithio propionamido hexanoate Pierce Chem. Co. Cat 21651G d Sulfo LC SPDP sulfosuccinimidyl 6 3 2 pyridyldithio propianamide hexanoate Pierce Chem. Co. Cat. 2165 G and f sulfo NHS N hydroxysulfo succinimide Pierce Chem. Co. Cat. 24510 conjugated to EDC.

The linkages or linking agents described above contain components that have different attributes thus leading to conjugates with differing physio chemical properties. For example sulfo NHS esters of alkyl carboxylates are more stable than sulfo NHS esters of aromatic carboxylates. NHS ester containing linkers are less soluble than sulfo NHS esters. Further the linker SMPT contains a sterically hindered disulfide bond and can form conjugates with increased stability. Disulfide linkages are in general less stable than other linkages because the disulfide linkage can be cleaved in vitro resulting in less conjugate available. Sulfo NHS in particular can enhance the stability of carbodimide couplings. Carbodimide couplings such as EDC when used in conjunction with sulfo NHS forms esters that are more resistant to hydrolysis than the carbodimide coupling reaction alone.

Exemplary cross linking molecules for use in the methods and immunogenic compostions as disclosed herein include but are not limited to those listed in Tables 3 and 4.

In some embodiments the immunogenic composition as disclosed herein comprises at least one co stimulatory molecule. In some embodiments the co stimulatory factor is cross linked to the polymer. In some embodiments the co stimulatory factor is associated to the polymer by a complementary affinity pair similar to as an antigen is associated with the polymer. In some embodiments where the complementary affinity pair which links the co stimulatory factor to the polymer is the same or a different complementary affinity pair which links the antigen to the polymer.

In some embodiments at least one or at least 2 or at least 3 or at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 15 or at least 20 or at least 50 or at least 100 or more than about 100 inclusive co stimulatory factors can be associated with the polymer as disclosed herein. In some embodiments the co stimulatory factors can be the same co stimulator factor or they can be a variety of different co stimulatory factors associated with the polymer.

In some embodiments the co stimulator factor is a ligand agonist of Toll like receptors e.g. but not limited to TLR1 TLR2 TLR3 TLR4 TLR5 TLR6 TLR7 TLR8 TLR9 TLR10 TLR11 etc. In some embodiments a co stimulator factor is a NOD ligand agonist or an activator agonist of the inflammasome. Without wishing to be bound by theory the inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer consisting of caspase 1 PYCARD NALP and sometimes caspase 5 or caspase 11 and promotes the maturation of inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 13 and interleukin 18.

In some embodiments a co stimulator factor is a cytokine. In some embodiments a cytokine is selected from the group consisting of GM CSF IL 1 IL 1 IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 8 IL 10 IL 12 IL 23 IFN IFN IFN IFN MIP 1 MIP 1 TGF TNF and TNF . In some embodiments the co stimulatory factor is an adjuvant which may be associated with the polymer as just discussed or may be added to the MAPS composition prior to or concurrent with administration to a subject. Adjuvants are further described elsewhere herein.

Recombinant proteins may be conveniently expressed and purified by a person skilled in the art or by using commercially available kits for example PB Purification System Invitrogen Corp. Carlsbad Calif. . In some embodiments recombinant antigens can be synthesized and purified by protein purification methods using bacterial expression systems yeast expression systems baculovirus insect cell expression system mammalian cell expression systems or transgenic plant or animal systems as known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.

The proteins polypeptides and fusion polypeptides described herein can all be synthesized and purified by protein and molecular methods that are well known to one skilled in the art. Molecular biology methods and recombinant heterologous protein expression systems are used. For example recombinant protein can be expressed in bacteria mammalian insect yeast or plant cells or in transgenic plant or animal hosts.

In one embodiment provided herein is an isolated polynucleotide encoding a fusion polypeptide or a non fusion polypeptide described herein. Conventional polymerase chain reaction PCR cloning techniques can be used to construct a chimeric or fusion coding sequence encoding a fusion polypeptide as described herein. A coding sequence can be cloned into a general purpose cloning vector such as pUC 19 pBR322 pBLUESCRIPT vectors Stratagene Inc. or pCR TOPO Invitrogen . The resultant recombinant vector carrying the nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide as described herein can then be used for further molecular biological manipulations such as site directed mutagenesis to create a variant fusion polypeptide as described herein or can be subcloned into protein expression vectors or viral vectors for protein synthesis in a variety of protein expression systems using host cells selected from the group consisting of mammalian cell lines insect cell lines yeast bacteria and plant cells.

Each PCR primer should have at least 15 nucleotides overlapping with its corresponding templates at the region to be amplified. The polymerase used in the PCR amplification should have high fidelity such as PfuULTRA polymerase Stratagene for reducing sequence mistakes during the PCR amplification process. For ease of ligating several separate PCR fragments together for example in the construction of a fusion polypeptide and subsequently inserting into a cloning vector the PCR primers should also have distinct and unique restriction digestion sites on their flanking ends that do not anneal to the DNA template during PCR amplification. The choice of the restriction digestion sites for each pair of specific primers should be such that the fusion polypeptide coding DNA sequence is in frame and will encode the fusion polypeptide from beginning to end with no stop codons. At the same time the chosen restriction digestion sites should not be found within the coding DNA sequence for the fusion polypeptide. The coding DNA sequence for the intended polypeptide can be ligated into cloning vector pBR322 or one of its derivatives for amplification verification of fidelity and authenticity of the chimeric coding sequence substitutions or specific site directed mutagenesis for specific amino acid mutations and substitutions in the polypeptide.

Alternatively the coding DNA sequence for the polypeptide can be PCR cloned into a vector using for example the TOPO cloning method comprising topoisomerase assisted TA vectors such as pCR TOPO pCR Blunt II TOPO pENTR D TOPO and pENTR SD D TOPO . Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad Calif. . Both pENTR D TOPO and pENTR SD D TOPO are directional TOPO entry vectors which allow the cloning of the DNA sequence in the 5 3 orientation into a GATEWAY expression vector. Directional cloning in the 5 3 orientation facilitates the unidirectional insertion of the DNA sequence into a protein expression vector such that the promoter is upstream of the 5 ATG start codon of the fusion polypeptide coding DNA sequence enabling promoter driven protein expression. The recombinant vector carrying the coding DNA sequence for the fusion polypeptide can be transfected into and propagated in general cloning such as XLIBlue SURE STRATAGENE and TOP 10 cells Invitrogen .

One skilled in the art would be able to clone and ligate the coding region of the antigen of interest with the coding region of the complementary affinity molecule to construct a chimeric coding sequence for a fusion polypeptide comprising the antigen or a fragment thereof and the complementary affinity molecule of a derivative thereof using specially designed oligonucleotide probes and polymerase chain reaction PCR methodologies that are well known in the art. One skilled in the art would also be able to clone and ligate the chimeric coding sequence for a fusion protein into a selected vector e.g. bacterial expression vector an insect expression vector or baculovirus expression vector. The coding sequences of antigen and the target antigen polypeptide or fragment thereof should be ligated in frame and the chimeric coding sequence should be ligated downstream of the promoter and between the promoter and the transcription terminator. Subsequent to that the recombinant vector is transfected into regular cloning such as XLIBlue. Recombinant harboring the transfer vector DNA is then selected by antibiotic resistance to remove any harboring non recombinant plasmid DNA. The selected transformant are grown and the recombinant vector DNA can be subsequently purified for transfection into cells.

In some embodiments the antigens as disclosed herein can comprise a signal peptide for translocation into periplasmic space of bacteria. The signal peptide is also called a leader peptide in the N terminus which may or may not be cleaved off after the translocation through the membrane. One example of a signal peptide is MKKIWLALAGLVLAFSASA SEQ ID NO 2 as disclosed herein. Another signal sequence is MAPFEPLASGILLLLWLIAPSRA SEQ ID NO 7 . Other examples of signal peptides can be found at SPdb a Signal Peptide Database which is found at the world wide web site of proline.bic.nus.edu.sg spdb .

In some embodiments where the antigen is fused to a biotin binding protein the signal sequence can be located at the N terminal of the biotin binding protein. In some embodiments the signal sequence is cleaved off from the biotin binding protein after translocation into the periplasmic space of

In some embodiments where the antigen is fused to a complementary affinity protein the signal sequence can be located at the N terminal of the complementary affinity protein. For example if an antigen is fused to an avidin like protein the signal sequence can be located at the N terminal of the complementary affinity protein. In some embodiments the signal sequence is cleaved off from the complementary affinity protein before the complementary affinity protein associates with the first affinity molecule.

In some embodiments an antigen and or complementary affinity protein as described herein lacks a signal sequence.

The polypeptides described herein can be expressed in a variety of expression host cells e.g. bacteria yeasts mammalian cells insect cells plant cells algal cells such as Chlamadomonas or in cell free expression systems. In some embodiments the nucleic acid can be subcloned from the cloning vector into a recombinant expression vector that is appropriate for the expression of fusion polypeptide in bacteria mammalian insect yeast or plant cells or a cell free expression system such as a rabbit reticulocyte expression system. Some vectors are designed to transfer coding nucleic acid for expression in mammalian cells insect cells and year in one single recombination reaction. For example some of the GATEWAY Invitrogen destination vectors are designed for the construction of baculovirus adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV retrovirus and lentiviruses which upon infecting their respective host cells permit heterologous expression of fusion polypeptides in the appropriate host cells. Transferring a gene into a destination vector is accomplished in just two steps according to manufacturer s instructions. There are GATEWAY expression vectors for protein expression in insect cells mammalian cells and yeast. Following transformation and selection in the expression vector is ready to be used for expression in the appropriate host.

Recent advances in the large scale expression heterologous proteins in are described. Griesbeck. 34 Mol. Biotechnol. 213 2006 Fuhrmann 94 Methods Mol Med. 191 2006 . Foreign heterologous coding sequences are inserted into the genome of the nucleus chloroplast and mitochondria by homologous recombination. The chloroplast expression vector p64 carrying the most versatile chloroplast selectable marker aminoglycoside adenyl transferase aadA which confer resistance to spectinomycin or streptomycin can be used to express foreign protein in the chloroplast. The biolistic gene gun method can be used to introduce the vector in the algae. Upon its entry into chloroplasts the foreign DNA is released from the gene gun particles and integrates into the chloroplast genome through homologous recombination.

Also included in the invention are complementary affinity molecule fused to an antigen. In some embodiments the fusion construct can also optionally comprise purification tags and or secretion signal peptides. These fusion proteins may be produced by any standard method. For example for production of a stable cell line expressing an antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein PCR amplified antigen nucleic acids may be cloned into the restriction site of a derivative of a mammalian expression vector. For example KA which is a derivative of pcDNA3 Invitrogen contains a DNA fragment encoding an influenza virus hemagglutinin tag HA . Alternatively vector derivatives encoding other tags such as c myc or poly Histidine tags can be used. The antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion expression construct may be co transfected with a marker plasmid into an appropriate mammalian cell line e.g. COS HEK293T or NIH 3T3 cells using for example LIPOFECTAMINE Gibco BRL Gaithersburg Md. according to the manufacturer s instructions or any other suitable transfection technique known in the art. Suitable transfection markers include for example galactosidase or green fluorescent protein GFP expression plasmids or any plasmid that does not contain the same detectable marker as the antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein. The fusion protein expressing cells can be sorted and further cultured or the tagged antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein can be purified. In some embodiments an antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein is amplified with a signal peptide. In alternative embodiments a cDNA encoding an antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein can be amplified without the signal peptide and subcloned into a vector pSecTagHis having a strong secretion signal peptide. In another example antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein can have an alkaline phosphatase AP tag or a histadine His tag for purification. Any method known to persons of ordinary skill in the art for protein purification of the antigen and or antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein is encompassed for use in the methods of the invention.

In some embodiments any of the polypeptides described herein is produced by expression from a recombinant baculovirus vector. In another embodiment any of the polypeptides described herein is expressed by an insect cell. In yet another embodiment any of the polypeptides described herein is isolated from an insect cell. There are several benefits of protein expression with baculovirus in insect cells including high expression levels ease of scale up production of proteins with posttranslational modifications and simplified cell growth. Insect cells do not require COfor growth and can be readily adapted to high density suspension culture for large scale expression. Many of the post translational modification pathways present in mammalian systems are also utilized in insect cells allowing the production of recombinant protein that is antigenically immunogenically and functionally similar to the native mammalian protein.

Baculoviruses are DNA viruses in the family Baculoviridae. These viruses are known to have a narrow host range that is limited primarily to Lepidopteran species of insects butterflies and moths . The baculovirus Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus AcNPV which has become the prototype baculovirus replicates efficiently in susceptible cultured insect cells. AcNPV has a double stranded closed circular DNA genome of about 130 000 base pairs and is well characterized with regard to host range molecular biology and genetics. The Baculovirus Expression Vector System BEVS is a safe and rapid method for the abundant production of recombinant proteins in insect cells and insects. Baculovirus expression systems are powerful and versatile systems for high level recombinant protein expression in insect cells. Expression levels up to 500 mg l have been reported using the baculovirus expression system making it an ideal system for high level expression. Recombinant baculoviruses that express foreign genes are constructed by way of homologous recombination between baculovirus DNA and chimeric plasmids containing the gene sequence of interest. Recombinant viruses can be detected by virtue of their distinct plaque morphology and plaque purified to homogeneity.

Recombinant fusion proteins described herein can be produced in insect cells including but not limited to cells derived from the Lepidopteran species . Other insect cells that can be infected by baculovirus such as those from the species or can also be used as a suitable substrate to produce recombinant proteins described herein. Baculovirus expression of recombinant proteins is well known in the art. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 745 051 U.S. Pat. No. 4 879 236 U.S. Pat. No. 5 179 007 U.S. Pat. No. 5 516 657 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 709 U.S. Pat. No. 5 759 809. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the expression system is not limited to a baculovirus expression system. What is important is that the expression system directs the N glycosylation of expressed recombinant proteins. The recombinant proteins described herein can also be expressed in other expression systems such as Entomopox viruses the poxviruses of insects cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses CPV and transformation of insect cells with the recombinant gene or genes constitutive expression. A good number of baculovirus transfer vectors and the corresponding appropriately modified host cells are commercially available for example pAcGP67 pAcSECG2TA pVL1392 pVL1393 pAcGHLT and pAcAB4 from BD Biosciences pBAC 3 pBAC 6 pBACgus 6 and pBACsurf 1 from NOVAGEN and pPolh FLAG and pPolh MAT from SIGMA ALDRICH .

The region between the promoter and the transcriptional terminator can have multiple restriction enzyme digestion sites for facilitating cloning of the foreign coding sequence in this instance the coding DNA sequence for an antigen polypeptide and a complementary affinity molecule. Additional sequences can be included e.g. signal peptides and or tag coding sequences such as His tag MAT Tag FLAG tag recognition sequence for enterokinase honeybee melittin secretion signal beta galactosidase glutathione S transferase GST tag upstream of the MCS for facilitating the secretion identification proper insertion positive selection of recombinant virus and or purification of the recombinant protein.

In some embodiments the fusion protein can comprise an N terminal signal sequence as disclosed herein. In some embodiments the signal sequence is attached to the N terminal of the complementary affinity molecule as disclosed herein.

In some embodiments a fusion polypeptide as described herein has a spacer peptide e.g. a 14 residue spacer GSPGISGGGGGILE SEQ ID NO 41 separating antigen from the complementary affinity molecule. The coding sequence of such a short spacer can be constructed by annealing a complementary pair of primers. One of skill in the art can design and synthesize oligonucleotides that will code for the selected spacer. Spacer peptides should generally have non polar amino acid residues such as glycine and proline.

Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations to create amino acid substitutions in an antigen polypeptide sequence of the fusion polypeptide described herein e. g. in the antigen in the nucleotide sequence encoding the fusion polypeptide described herein including for example site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis. Preferably the variant fusion polypeptide has less than 50 amino acid substitutions less than 40 amino acid substitutions less than 30 amino acid substitutions less than 25 amino acid substitutions less than 20 amino acid substitutions less than 15 amino acid substitutions less than 10 amino acid substitutions less than 5 amino acid substitutions less than 4 amino acid substitutions less than 3 amino acid substitutions or less than 2 amino acid substitutions inclusive relative to the fusion polypeptides described herein.

Certain silent or neutral missense mutations can also be made in the DNA coding sequence that do not change the encoded amino acid sequence or the capability to promote transmembrane delivery. These types of mutations are useful to optimize codon usage or to improve recombinant protein expression and production.

Specific site directed mutagenesis of a coding sequence for the fusion polypeptide in a vector can be used to create specific amino acid mutations and substitutions. Site directed mutagenesis can be carried out using e. g. the QUICKCHANGE site directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer s instructions.

In one embodiment described herein are expression vectors comprising the coding DNA sequence for the polypeptides described herein for the expression and purification of the recombinant polypeptide produced from a protein expression system using host cells selected from e.g. bacteria mammalian insect yeast or plant cells. The expression vector should have the necessary 5 upstream and 3 downstream regulatory elements such as promoter sequences ribosome recognition and TATA box and 3 UTR AAUAAA transcription termination sequence for efficient gene transcription and translation in its respective host cell. The expression vector is preferably a vector having the transcription promoter selected from a group consisting of CMV cytomegalovirus promoter RSV Rous sarcoma virus promoter actin promoter SV40 simian virus 40 promoter and muscle creatine kinase promoter and the transcription terminator selected from a group consisting of SV40 poly A and BGH terminator more preferably an expression vector having the early promoter enhancer sequence of cytomegalovirus and the adenovirus tripartite leader intron sequence and containing the replication origin and poly A sequence of SV40. The expression vector can have additional coding regions such as those encoding for example 6 histidine SEQ ID NO 10 V5 thioredoxin glutathione S transferase c Myc VSV G HSV FLAG maltose binding peptide metal binding peptide HA and secretion signals Honeybee melittin a factor PHO Bip which can be incorporated into the expressed fusion polypeptide. In addition there can be enzyme digestion sites incorporated after these coding regions to facilitate their enzymatic removal if they are not needed. These additional nucleic acids are useful for the detection of fusion polypeptide expression for protein purification by affinity chromatography enhanced solubility of the recombinant protein in the host cytoplasm and or for secreting the expressed fusion polypeptide out into the culture media or the spheroplast of the yeast cells. The expression of the fusion polypeptide can be constitutive in the host cells or it can be induced e.g. with copper sulfate sugars such as galactose methanol methylamine thiamine tetracycline infection with baculovirus and isopropyl beta D thiogalactopyranoside IPTG a stable synthetic analog of lactose.

In another embodiment the expression vector comprising a polynucleotide described herein is a viral vector such as adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV retrovirus and lentivirus vectors among others. Recombinant viruses provide a versatile system for gene expression studies and therapeutic applications.

In some embodiments the fusion polypeptides described herein are expressed from viral infection of mammalian cells. The viral vectors can be for example adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV retrovirus and lentivirus. A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses is presented by He et al. 95 PNAS 2509 1998 . The gene of interest is first cloned into a shuttle vector e.g. pAdTrack CMV. The resultant plasmid is linearized by digesting with restriction endonuclease PmeI and subsequently cotransformed into . BJ5183 cells with an adenoviral backbone plasmid e.g. pADEASY 1 of Stratagene s ADEASY Adenoviral Vector System. Recombinant adenovirus vectors are selected for kanamycin resistance and recombination confirmed by restriction endonuclease analyses. Finally the linearized recombinant plasmid is transfected into adenovirus packaging cell lines for example HEK 293 cells El transformed human embryonic kidney cells or 911 El transformed human embryonic retinal cells . Fallaux et al. 7 Human Gene Ther. 215 1996 . Recombinant adenovirus are generated within the HEK 293 cells.

Recombinant lentivirus has the advantage of delivery and expression of fusion polypeptides in dividing and non dividing mammalian cells. The HIV 1 based lentivirus can effectively transduce a broader host range than the Moloney Leukemia Virus MoMLV based retroviral systems. Preparation of the recombinant lentivirus can be achieved using for example the pLenti4N5 DEST pLenti6N5 DEST or pLenti vectors together with VIRAPOWER Lentiviral Expression systems from Invitrogen Inc.

Recombinant adeno associated virus rAAV vectors are applicable to a wide range of host cells including many different human and non human cell lines or tissues. rAAVs are capable of transducing a broad range of cell types and transduction is not dependent on active host cell division. High titers 10 viral particle ml are easily obtained in the supematant and 10 10viral particle ml with further concentration. The transgene is integrated into the host genome so expression is long term and stable.

Large scale preparation of AAV vectors is made by a three plasmid cotransfection of a packaging cell line AAV vector carrying the coding nucleic acid AAV RC vector containing AAV rep and cap genes and adenovirus helper plasmid pDF6 into 50 150 mm plates of subconfluent 293 cells. Cells are harvested three days after transfection and viruses are released by three freeze thaw cycles or by sonication.

AAV vectors can be purified by two different methods depending on the serotype of the vector. AAV2 vector is purified by the single step gravity flow column purification method based on its affinity for heparin. Auricchio et. al. 12 Human Gene Ther. 71 2001 Summerford Samulski 72 J. Virol. 1438 1998 Summerford Samulski 5 Nat. Med. 587 1999 . AAV2 1 and AAV2 5 vectors are currently purified by three sequential CsCl gradients.

Without wishing to be bound to theory when proteins are expressed by a cell including a bacterial cell the proteins are targeted to a particular part in the cell or secreted from the cell. Thus protein targeting or protein sorting is the mechanism by which a cell transports proteins to the appropriate positions in the cell or outside of it. Sorting targets can be the inner space of an organelle any of several interior membranes the cell s outer membrane or its exterior via secretion. This delivery process is carried out based on information contained in the protein itself. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell errors can lead to diseases.

With some exceptions bacteria lack membrane bound organelles as found in eukaryotes but they may assemble proteins onto various types of inclusions such as gas vesicles and storage granules. Also depending on the species of bacteria bacteria may have a single plasma membrane Gram positive bacteria or both an inner plasma membrane and an outer cell wall membrane with an aqueous space between the two called the periplasm Gram negative bacteria . Proteins can be secreted into the environment according to whether or not there is an outer membrane. The basic mechanism at the plasma membrane is similar to the eukaryotic one. In addition bacteria may target proteins into or across the outer membrane. Systems for secreting proteins across the bacterial outer membrane may be quite complex and play key roles in pathogenesis. These systems may be described as type I secretion type II secretion etc.

In most Gram positive bacteria certain proteins are targeted for export across the plasma membrane and subsequent covalent attachment to the bacterial cell wall. A specialized enzyme sortase cleaves the target protein at a characteristic recognition site near the protein C terminus such as an LPXTG motif SEQ ID NO 42 where X can be any amino acid then transfers the protein onto the cell wall. A system analogous to sortase LPXTG LPXTG disclosed as SEQ ID NO 42 having the motif PEP CTERM SEQ ID NO 43 termed exosortase PEP CTERM PEP disclosed as SEQ ID NO 43 is proposed to exist in a broad range of Gram negative bacteria.

Proteins with appropriate N terminal targeting signals are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then directed to a specific protein transport pathway. During or shortly after its translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane the protein is processed and folded into its active form. Then the translocated protein is either retained at the periplasmic side of the cell or released into the environment. Since the signal peptides that target proteins to the membrane are key determinants for transport pathway specificity these signal peptides are classified according to the transport pathway to which they direct proteins. Signal peptide classification is based on the type of signal peptidase SPase that is responsible for the removal of the signal peptide. The majority of exported proteins are exported from the cytoplasm via the general Secretory Sec pathway . Most well known virulence factors e.g. exotoxins of protective antigen of lysteriolysin O of that are secreted by Gram positive pathogens have a typical N terminal signal peptide that would lead them to the Sec pathway. Proteins that are secreted via this pathway are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane in an unfolded state. Subsequent processing and folding of these proteins takes place in the cell wall environment on the trans side of the membrane. In addition to the Sec system some Gram positive bacteria also contain the Tat system that is able to translocate folded proteins across the membrane. Pathogenic bacteria may contain certain special purpose export systems that are specifically involved in the transport of only a few proteins. For example several gene clusters have been identified in mycobacteria that encode proteins that are secreted into the environment via specific pathways ESAT 6 and are important for mycobacterial pathogenesis. Specific ATP binding cassette ABC transporters direct the export and processing of small antibacterial peptides called bacteriocins. Genes for endolysins that are responsible for the onset of bacterial lysis are often located near genes that encode for holin like proteins suggesting that these holins are responsible for endolysin export to the cell wall. Wooldridge B. SP SM. RP. Caister Academic Press 2009 

In some embodiments the signal sequence useful in the present invention is OmpA Signal sequence however any signal sequence commonly known by persons of ordinary skill in the art which allows the transport and secretion of antimicrobial agents outside the bacteriophage infected cell are encompassed for use in the present invention.

Signal sequence that direct secretion of proteins from bacterial cells are well known in the art for example as disclosed in International application WO 2005 071088. For example one can use some of the non limited examples of signal peptide shown in Table 5 which can be attached to the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus of the antimicrobial peptide Amp or antimicrobial polypeptide to be expressed by the antimicrobial agent engineered bacteriophage e.g. AMP engineered bacteriophage. Attachment can be via fusion or chimera composition with selected antigen or antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein resulting in the secretion from the bacterium infected with the antimicrobial agent engineered bacteriophage e.g. AMP engineered bacteriophage.

The polypeptides as described herein e.g. antigens or antigen complementary affinity molecule fusion protein can be expressed and purified by a variety methods known to one skilled in the art for example the fusion polypeptides described herein can be purified from any suitable expression system. Fusion polypeptides can be purified to substantial purity by standard techniques including selective precipitation with such substances as ammonium sulfate column chromatography immunopurification methods and others which are well known in the art. See e.g. Scopes PP P P 1982 U.S. Pat. No. 4 673 641.

A number of procedures can be employed when recombinant proteins are purified. For example proteins having established molecular adhesion properties can be reversibly fused to the protein of choice. With the appropriate ligand the protein can be selectively adsorbed to a purification column and then freed from the column in a relatively pure form. The fused protein is then removed by enzymatic activity. Finally the protein of choice can be purified using affinity or immunoaffinity columns.

After the protein is expressed in the host cells the host cells can be lysed to liberate the expressed protein for purification. Methods of lysing the various host cells are featured in Sample Preparation Tools for Protein Research EMD Bioscience and in the Current Protocols in Protein Sciences CPPS . An example purification method is affinity chromatography such as metal ion affinity chromatograph using nickel cobalt or zinc affinity resins for histidine tagged fusion polypeptides. Methods of purifying histidine tagged recombinant proteins are described by Clontech using their TALON cobalt resin and by NOVAGEN in their pET system manual 10th edition. Another preferred purification strategy is immuno affinity chromatography for example anti myc antibody conjugated resin can be used to affinity purify myc tagged fusion polypeptides. When appropriate protease recognition sequences are present fusion polypeptides can be cleaved from the histidine or myc tag releasing the fusion polypeptide from the affinity resin while the histidine tags and myc tags are left attached to the affinity resin.

Standard protein separation techniques for purifying recombinant and naturally occurring proteins are well known in the art e.g. solubility fractionation size exclusion gel filtration and various column chromatography.

Often as an initial step particularly if the protein mixture is complex an initial salt fractionation can separate many of the unwanted host cell proteins or proteins derived from the cell culture media from the protein of interest. The preferred salt is ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate precipitates proteins by effectively reducing the amount of water in the protein mixture. Proteins then precipitate on the basis of their solubility. The more hydrophobic a protein is the more likely it is to precipitate at lower ammonium sulfate concentrations. A typical protocol includes adding saturated ammonium sulfate to a protein solution so that the resultant ammonium sulfate concentration is between 20 30 . This concentration will precipitate the most hydrophobic of proteins. The precipitate is then discarded unless the protein of interest is hydrophobic and ammonium sulfate is added to the supernatant to a concentration known to precipitate the protein of interest. The precipitate is then solubilized in buffer and the excess salt removed if necessary either through dialysis or diafiltration. Other methods that rely on solubility of proteins such as cold ethanol precipitation are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used to fractionate complex protein mixtures.

The molecular weight of the protein of choice can be used to isolate it from proteins of greater and lesser size using ultrafiltration through membranes of different pore size for example AMICON or MILLIPORE membranes . As a first step the protein mixture is ultrafiltered through a membrane with a pore size that has a lower molecular weight cut off than the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The retentate of the ultrafiltration is then ultrafiltered against a membrane with a molecular cut off greater than the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The recombinant protein will pass through the membrane into the filtrate. The filtrate can then be chromatographed as described below.

The protein of choice can also be separated from other proteins on the basis of its size net surface charge hydrophobicity and affinity for ligands. In addition antibodies raised against recombinant or naturally occurring proteins can be conjugated to column matrices and the proteins immunopurified. All of these methods are well known in the art. It will be apparent to one of skill that chromatographic techniques can be performed at any scale and using equipment from many different manufacturers e.g. Pharmacia Biotech . For example an antigen polypeptide can be purified using a PA63 heptamer affinity column. Singh et al. 269 J. Biol. Chem. 29039 1994 .

In some embodiments a combination of purification steps comprising for example a ion exchange chromatography b hydroxyapatite chromatography c hydrophobic interaction chromatography and d size exclusion chromatography can be used to purify the fusion polypeptides described herein.

Cell free expression systems are also contemplated. Cell free expression systems offer several advantages over traditional cell based expression methods including the easy modification of reaction conditions to favor protein folding decreased sensitivity to product toxicity and suitability for high throughput strategies such as rapid expression screening or large amount protein production because of reduced reaction volumes and process time. The cell free expression system can use plasmid or linear DNA. Moreover improvements in translation efficiency have resulted in yields that exceed a milligram of protein per milliliter of reaction mix. Commercially available cell free expression systems include the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate Systems Promega which uses rabbit reticulocyte based in vitro system.

Specific embodiments of the present invention provide for use of the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein to elicit an immune response in an animal. More specifically the compositions elicit both humoral and cellular immunity and in many instance mucosal immunity. Embodiments of the present invention provide at least partial protection from or partial improvement after infection by in particular pneumococcus. Pneumococci cause a number of diseases such as meningitis pneumonia bacteremia and otitis media. Almost one million children die of pneumococcal diseases worldwide every year. have been studied extensively and at least some of the genomes sequenced. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 141 418. Although antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides which define the known serotypes confer serotype specific protection other protective mechanisms of immunity have been described. See Malley et al. 88 J. Mol. Med. 135 2010 . These other protective mechanisms include but are not limited to antibodies to noncapsular antigens and T cell responses to pneumococcal constituents. The application of protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccine PCV7 has reduced diseases significantly. Black et al. 24 S2 Vaccine 79 2006 Hansen et al. 25 Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 779 2006 . Yet recent studies have shown that the lack of other serotypes in PCV7 has resulted in emerging replacement pneumococcal serotypes. Pichichero Casey 26 S10 Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. S12 2007 .

Certain pneumococcal antigens common to all serotypes of the species have been shown to have immunoprotective potential despite the encapsulation e.g. the surface proteins PspA PspC PsaA and the cytotoxin pneumolysin or pneumolysoid mutants Basset et al. 75 Infect. Immun. 5460 2007 Briles et al. 18 Vaccine 1707 2000 the use of genomics and mutational libraries has identified several dozen additional species common proteins Hava Camilli 45 Mol.

Dis. 839 1997 but no vaccine based on a common antigen has been approved for human use to date.

Accordingly one aspect of the present invention relates to methods to elicit an immune response in a subject comprising administering to the subject an immunogenic composition comprising at least one type of the polymer e.g. a polysaccharide at least one antigen and at least one complementary affinity molecule pair comprising i a first affinity molecule which associates with the polymer e.g. a polysaccharide and ii a complementary affinity molecule which associates with the antigen to attach the antigen to the polymer e.g. a polysaccharide e.g. the first affinity molecule associates with the complementary affinity molecule to link the antigen to the polymer e.g. polysaccharide .

Accordingly one aspect of the present invention relates to methods to elicit a humoral and or cellular immunity to multiple antigens at the same time e.g. where the immunogenic composition administered to the subject comprises a polymer comprising at least 1 or at least 2 or a more e.g. a plurality of the same or different antigens.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of immunization or vaccinating a subject e.g. a bird or a mammal e.g. a human against a pathogen comprises administering an immune composition as disclosed herein comprising at least one antigen derived from one or more pathogens. In some embodiments a subject can be immunized against at least 1 or at least 2 or at least 2 or at least 3 or at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 15 or at least about 20 or at least 50 or at least about 100 or more than 100 different pathogens at the same time where the polymer of the immunogenic composition as the corresponding different antigens attached.

In some embodiments a subject can be administered several different immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein for example a subject can be administered a composition comprising a polymer with an antigen or a plurality of antigens e.g. antigens A B C and D etc. and also administered a composition comprising a polymer comprising a different antigen or a different set of antigens e.g. antigens W X Y and Z etc. Alternatively a subject can be administered a composition comprising a polymer A with an antigen or a plurality of antigens e.g. antigens A B C and D etc. and also administered a composition comprising a polymer B comprising the same e.g. antigens A B C and D etc. or a different set of antigens. It is envisioned that the present invention provides a methods for the immunization of a subject with as many antigens as desired e.g. with a variety of different immunogenic complexes as described herein to enable immunization with as many as 100 or more antigens.

In one embodiment the immunogenic compositions as described herein comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment the immunogenic composition described herein is formulated for administering to a bird mammal or human as or in a vaccine. Suitable formulations can be found in for example Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 2006 or Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 4th ed. Lea Febiger Philadelphia 1985 .

In one embodiment the immunogenic compositions as described herein comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are inherently nontoxic and nontherapeutic. Examples of such carriers include ion exchangers alumina aluminum stearate lecithin serum proteins such as human serum albumin buffer substances such as phosphates glycine sorbic acid potassium sorbate partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids water salts or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate disodium hydrogen phosphate potassium hydrogen phosphate sodium chloride zinc salts colloidal silica magnesium trisilicate polyvinyl pyrrolidone cellulose based substances and polyethylene glycol. For all administrations conventional depot forms are suitably used. Such forms include for example microcapsules nano capsules liposomes plasters inhalation forms nose sprays sublingual tablets and sustained release preparations. For examples of sustained release compositions see U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 No. 3 887 699 EP 58 481A EP 158 277A Canadian Patent No. 1176565 Sidman et al. 22 Biopolymers 547 1983 Langer et al. 12 Chem. Tech. 98 1982 . The proteins will usually be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml per application per patient.

In one embodiment other ingredients can be added to vaccine formulations including antioxidants e.g. ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about ten residues polypeptides e.g. polyarginine or tripeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamic acid aspartic acid or arginine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA and sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol.

In some embodiments the present MAPS immunogen compositions are administered with at least one adjuvant. Adjuvants are a heterogeneous group of substances that enhance the immunological response against an antigen that is administered simultaneously. In some instances adjuvants improve the immune response so that less vaccine is needed. Adjuvants serve to bring the antigen the substance that stimulates the specific protective immune response into contact with the immune system and influence the type of immunity produced as well as the quality of the immune response magnitude or duration . Adjuvants can also decrease the toxicity of certain antigens and provide solubility to some vaccine components. Almost all adjuvants used today for enhancement of the immune response against antigens are particles or form particles together with the antigen. In the book VD Powell Newman Eds. Plenum Press 1995 many known adjuvants are described both regarding their immunological activity and regarding their chemical characteristics. The type of adjuvants that do not form particles are a group of substances that act as immunological signal substances and that under normal conditions consist of the substances that are formed by the immune system as a consequence of the immunological activation after administration of particulate adjuvant systems.

Adjuvants for immunogenic compositions and vaccines are well known in the art.

In some embodiments an adjuvant is a particulate and can have a characteristic of being slowly biodegradable. Care must be taken to ensure that that the adjuvant do not form toxic metabolites. Preferably in some embodiments such adjuvants can be matrices used are mainly substances originating from a body. These include lactic acid polymers poly amino acids proteins carbohydrates lipids and biocompatible polymers with low toxicity. Combinations of these groups of substances originating from a body or combinations of substances originating from a body and biocompatible polymers can also be used. Lipids are the preferred substances since they display structures that make them biodegradable as well as the fact that they are a critical element in all biological membranes.

In one embodiment the immunogenic compositions as described herein for administration must be sterile for administration to a subject. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes e.g. 0.2 micron membranes or by gamma irradiation.

In some embodiments the immunogenic compositions described herein further comprise pharmaceutical excipients including but not limited to biocompatible oils physiological saline solutions preservatives carbohydrate protein amino acids osmotic pressure controlling agents carrier gases pH controlling agents organic solvents hydrophobic agents enzyme inhibitors water absorbing polymers surfactants absorption promoters and anti oxidative agents.

Such pharmaceutical excipients are well known in the art.

In some embodiments the immunogenic MAPS composition is administered in combination with other therapeutic ingredients including e.g. interferon cytokines chemotherapeutic agents or anti inflammatory or anti viral agents. In some embodiments the immunogenic composition as disclosed herein can be administered with one or more co stimulatory molecules and or adjuvants as disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the immunogenic composition is administered in a pure or substantially pure form but may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition formulation or preparation. Such formulation comprises MAPS described herein together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. Other therapeutic ingredients include compounds that enhance antigen presentation e.g. gamma interferon cytokines chemotherapeutic agents or anti inflammatory agents. The formulations can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by methods well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example Plotkin and Mortimer in V 2nd ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 1994 describes vaccination of animals or humans to induce an immune response specific for particular pathogens as well as methods of preparing antigen determining a suitable dose of antigen and assaying for induction of an immune response.

Formulations suitable for intravenous intramuscular intranasal oral sublingual vaginal rectal subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration conveniently comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient with solutions which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations may be conveniently prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient in water containing physiologically compatible substances such as sodium chloride e.g. 0.1M 2.0 M glycine and the like and having a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions to produce an aqueous solution and rendering the solution sterile. These may be present in unit or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules or vials.

Liposomal suspensions can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811.

Formulations for an intranasal delivery are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 782 U.S. Pat. No. 5 843 451 U.S. Pat. No. 6 398 774.

The formulations of the immunogenic compositions can incorporate a stabilizer. Illustrative stabilizers are polyethylene glycol proteins saccharide amino acids inorganic acids and organic acids which may be used either on their own or as admixtures. Two or more stabilizers may be used in aqueous solutions at the appropriate concentration and or pH. The specific osmotic pressure in such aqueous solution is generally in the range of 0.1 3.0 osmoses preferably in the range of 0.80 1.2. The pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted to be within the range of pH 5.0 9.0 preferably within the range of pH 6 8.

When oral preparations are desired the immunogenic compositions can be combined with typical carriers such as lactose sucrose starch talc magnesium stearate crystalline cellulose methyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose glycerin sodium alginate or gum arabic among others.

In some embodiments the immunogenic compositions as described herein can be administered intravenously intranasally intramuscularly subcutaneously intraperitoneally sublingually vaginal rectal or orally. In some embodiments the route of administration is oral intranasal subcutaneous or intramuscular. In some embodiments the route of administration is intranasal administration.

Vaccination can be conducted by conventional methods. For example an immunogenic compositions can be used in a suitable diluent such as saline or water or complete or incomplete adjuvants. The immunogenic composition can be administered by any route appropriate for eliciting an immune response. The immunogenic composition can be administered once or at periodic intervals until an immune response is elicited. Immune responses can be detected by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to antibody production cytotoxicity assay proliferation assay and cytokine release assays. For example samples of blood can be drawn from the immunized mammal and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against the antigens of the immunogenic composition by ELISA see de Boer et. al. 115 Arch Virol. 147 1990 and the titer of these antibodies can be determined by methods known in the art.

The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. For example a range of 25 g 900 g total protein can be administered monthly for three months.

Ultimately the attending physician will decide the amount of immunogenic composition or vaccine composition to administer to particular individuals. As with all immunogenic compositions or vaccines the immunologically effective amounts of the immunogens must be determined empirically. Factors to be considered include the immunogenicity whether or not the immunogen will be complexed with or covalently attached to an adjuvant or carrier protein or other carrier routes of administrations and the number of immunizing dosages to be administered. Such factors are known in the vaccine art and it is well within the skill of immunologists to make such determinations without undue experimentation.

In one embodiment an immunogenic composition or vaccine composition as described herein when administered to mice can provoke an immune response that prevents a disease symptom in at least 20 of animals challenged with 5 LDof the immunogenic composition comprising antigens to which the disease symptom is prevented. Methods of vaccination and challenging an immunized animal are known to one skilled in the art. For example a 10 g aliquot of an immunogenic composition or vaccine composition as disclosed herein can be prepared in 100 g PBS and or with addition of incomplete Freund s adjuvant and injected intramuscularly per mouse per vaccination. Alternatively parenteral intraperitoneal and footpad injections can be used. Volumes of footpad injections are reduced to 50 l. Mice can be immunized with an immunogenic composition or vaccine composition as disclosed herein on three separate occasions with several days e.g. 14 days interval in between.

Efficacy of vaccination can be tested by challenge with the pathogen. Seven days after the last dose of an immunogenic composition the immunized mice are challenged intranasally with a pathogenic organism from which the antigen was derived. Ether anaesthetized mice 10 g to 12 g can be infected intranasally with 50 l of PBS diluted allantoic fluid containing 5 LDof the pathogenic organism. Protection can be measured by monitoring animal survival and body weight which is assessed throughout an observation period of 21 days. Severely affected mice are euthanized. One LDof A Mallard Pennsylvania 10218 84 is equal to 100 1000 the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose50 TCID50 assay.

In other embodiments the immunized mice can be challenged with a variety of different pathogenic organisms e.g. different pathogenic organisms from which each of the antigens attached to the polymer are derived. For example of an immunogenic composition comprises five different antigens attached to the polymer e.g. polysaccharide where each antigen is derived from five different pathogenic organisms the immunized mice can be challenged with each of the five different pathogenic organisms either sequentially in any order or concurrently. One skilled in the art would be able to determine the LDfor each pathogenic organism used to challenge the immunized mice by methods known in the art. See e.g. LaBarre Lowy 96 J. Virol. Meths. 107 2001 Golub 59 J. Immunol. 7 1948 .

The terms Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte or CTL refers to lymphocytes which induce apoptosis in targeted cells. CTLs form antigen specific conjugates with target cells via interaction of TCRs with processed antigen Ag on target cell surfaces resulting in apoptosis of the targeted cell. Apoptotic bodies are eliminated by macrophages. The term CTL response is used to refer to the primary immune response mediated by CTL cells.

The term cell mediated immunity or CMI as used herein refers to an immune response that does not involve antibodies or complement but rather involves the activation of for example macrophages natural killer cells NK antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes T cells and the release of various cytokines in response to a target antigen. Stated another way CMI refers to immune cells such as T cells and other lymphocytes which bind to the surface of other cells that display a target antigen such as antigen presenting cells APS and trigger a response. The response may involve either other lymphocytes and or any of the other white blood cells leukocytes and the release of cytokines. Cellular immunity protects the body by i activating antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs that are able to destroy body cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigen on their surface such as virus infected cells and cells with intracellular bacteria 2 activating macrophages and NK cells enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens and 3 stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.

The term immune cell as used herein refers to any cell which can release a cytokine in response to a direct or indirect antigenic stimulation.

The term cytokine does not include antibodies

The term subject as used herein refers to any animal in which it is useful to elicit an immune response. The subject can be a wild domestic commercial or companion animal such as a bird or mammal. The subject can be a human. Although in one embodiment of the invention it is contemplated that the immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein can also be suitable for the therapeutic or preventative treatment in humans it is also applicable to warm blooded vertebrates e.g. mammals such as non human primates particularly higher primates sheep dog rodent e.g. mouse or rat guinea pig goat pig cat rabbits cows and non mammals such as chickens ducks or turkeys. In another embodiment the subject is a wild animal for example a bird such as for the diagnosis of avian flu. In some embodiments the subject is an experimental animal or animal substitute as a disease model. The subject may be a subject in need of veterinary treatment where eliciting an immune response to an antigen is useful to prevent a disease and or to control the spread of a disease for example SIV STL1 SFV or in the case of live stock hoof and mouth disease or in the case of birds Marek s disease or avian influenza and other such diseases.

As used herein the term pathogen refers to an organism or molecule that causes a disease or disorder in a subject. For example pathogens include but are not limited to viruses fungi bacteria parasites and other infectious organisms or molecules therefrom as well as taxonomically related macroscopic organisms within the categories algae fungi yeast protozoa or the like.

A cancer cell refers to a cancerous pre cancerous or transformed cell either in vivo ex vivo or in tissue culture that has spontaneous or induced phenotypic changes that do not necessarily involve the uptake of new genetic material. Although transformation can arise from infection with a transforming virus and incorporation of new genomic nucleic acid or uptake of exogenous nucleic acid it can also arise spontaneously or following exposure to a carcinogen thereby mutating an endogenous gene. Transformation cancer is associated with e.g. morphological changes immortalization of cells aberrant growth control foci formation anchorage independence malignancy loss of contact inhibition and density limitation of growth growth factor or serum independence tumor specific markers invasiveness or metastasis and tumor growth in suitable animal hosts such as nude mice. See e.g. Freshney CAC MBT. 3rd ed. 1994 .

The term wild type refers to the naturally occurring normal polynucleotide sequence encoding a protein or a portion thereof or protein sequence or portion thereof respectively as it normally exists in vivo.

The term mutant refers to an organism or cell with any change in its genetic material in particular a change i.e. deletion substitution addition or alteration relative to a wild type polynucleotide sequence or any change relative to a wild type protein sequence. The term variant may be used interchangeably with mutant . Although it is often assumed that a change in the genetic material results in a change of the function of the protein the terms mutant and variant refer to a change in the sequence of a wild type protein regardless of whether that change alters the function of the protein e.g. increases decreases imparts a new function or whether that change has no effect on the function of the protein e.g. the mutation or variation is silent .

The term pharmaceutically acceptable refers to compounds and compositions which may be administered to mammals without undue toxicity. The term pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excludes tissue culture medium. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to mineral acid salts such as hydrochlorides hydrobromides phosphates sulfates and the like and the salts of organic acids such as acetates propionates malonates benzoates and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art.

It will be appreciated that proteins or polypeptides often contain amino acids other than the 20 amino acids commonly referred to as the 20 naturally occurring amino acids and that many amino acids including the terminal amino acids can be modified in a given polypeptide either by natural processes such as glycosylation and other post translational modifications or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Known modifications which can be present in polypeptides of the present invention include but are not limited to acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a polynucleotide or polynucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cystine formation of pyroglutamate formulation gamma carboxylation glycation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristoylation oxidation proteolytic processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation and ubiquitination.

As used herein the terms homologous or homologues are used interchangeably and when used to describe a polynucleotide or polypeptide indicate that two polynucleotides or polypeptides or designated sequences thereof when optimally aligned and compared for example using BLAST version 2. 2. 14 with default parameters for an alignment are identical with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions or amino acid insertions or deletions in at least 70 of the nucleotides usually from about 75 to 99 such as at least about 98 to 99 of the nucleotides. For a polypeptide there should be at least 50 of amino acid identity in the polypeptide. The term homolog or homologous as used herein also refers to homology with respect to structure. Determination of homologs of genes or polypeptides can be easily ascertained by the skilled artisan. When in the context with a defined percentage the defined percentage homology means at least that percentage of amino acid similarity. For example 85 homology refers to at least 85 of amino acid similarity.

As used herein the term heterologous reference to nucleic acid sequences proteins or polypeptides mean that these molecules are not naturally occurring in that cell. For example the nucleic acid sequence coding for a fusion antigen polypeptide described herein that is inserted into a cell e.g. in the context of a protein expression vector is a heterologous nucleic acid sequence.

For sequence comparison typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are input into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence s relative to the reference sequence based on the designated program parameters. Where necessary or desired optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted by any variety of approaches as these are well known in the art.

The term variant as used herein may refer to a polypeptide or nucleic acid that differs from the naturally occurring polypeptide or nucleic acid by one or more amino acid or nucleic acid deletions additions substitutions or side chain modifications yet retains one or more specific functions or biological activities of the naturally occurring molecule. Amino acid substitutions include alterations in which an amino acid is replaced with a different naturally occurring or a non conventional amino acid residue. Such substitutions may be classified as conservative in which case an amino acid residue contained in a polypeptide is replaced with another naturally occurring amino acid of similar character either in relation to polarity side chain functionality or size. Substitutions encompassed by variants as described herein may also be non conservative in which an amino acid residue which is present in a peptide is substituted with an amino acid having different properties e.g. substituting a charged or hydrophobic amino acid with alanine or alternatively in which a naturally occurring amino acid is substituted with a non conventional amino acid. Also encompassed within the term variant when used with reference to a polynucleotide or polypeptide are variations in primary secondary or tertiary structure as compared to a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide respectively e.g. as compared to a wild type polynucleotide or polypeptide .

The term substantially similar when used in reference to a variant of an antigen or a functional derivative of an antigen as compared to the original antigen means that a particular subject sequence varies from the sequence of the antigen polypeptide by one or more substitutions deletions or additions but retains at least 50 or higher e.g. at least 60 70 80 90 or more inclusive of the function of the antigen to elicit an immune response in a subject. In determining polynucleotide sequences all subject polynucleotide sequences capable of encoding substantially similar amino acid sequences are considered to be substantially similar to a reference polynucleotide sequence regardless of differences in codon sequence. A nucleotide sequence is substantially similar to a given antigen nucleic acid sequence if a the nucleotide sequence hybridizes to the coding regions of the native antigen sequence or b the nucleotide sequence is capable of hybridization to nucleotide sequence of the native antigen under moderately stringent conditions and has biological activity similar to the native antigen protein or c the nucleotide sequences are degenerate as a result of the genetic code relative to the nucleotide sequences defined in a or b . Substantially similar proteins will typically be greater than about 80 similar to the corresponding sequence of the native protein.

Variants can include conservative or non conservative amino acid changes as described below. Polynucleotide changes can result in amino acid substitutions additions deletions fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Variants can also include insertions deletions or substitutions of amino acids including insertions and substitutions of amino acids and other molecules that do not normally occur in the peptide sequence that is the basis of the variant for example but not limited to insertion of omithine which do not normally occur in human proteins. Conservative amino acid substitutions result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and or chemical properties. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Serine S Threonine T 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V and 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W . See e.g. Creighton PROTEINS W. H. Freeman Co. 1984 .

The choice of conservative amino acids may be selected based on the location of the amino acid to be substituted in the peptide for example if the amino acid is on the exterior of the peptide and exposed to solvents or on the interior and not exposed to solvents. Selection of such conservative amino acid substitutions is within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly one can select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the exterior of a protein or peptide i. e. amino acids exposed to a solvent . These substitutions include but are not limited to the following substitution of Y with F T with S or K P with A E with D or Q N with D or G R with K G with N or A T with S or K D with N or E I with L or V F with Y S with T or A R with K G with N or A K with R A with S K or P.

Alternatively one can also select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the interior of a protein or peptide i.e. the amino acids are not exposed to a solvent . For example one can use the following conservative substitutions where Y is substituted with F T with A or S I with L or V W with Y M with L N with D G with A T with A or S D with N I with L or V F with Y or L S with A or T and A with S G T or V. In some embodiments LF polypeptides including non conservative amino acid substitutions are also encompassed within the term variants. As used herein the term non conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has different chemical properties. Non limiting examples of non conservative substitutions include aspartic acid D being replaced with glycine G asparagine N being replaced with lysine K and alanine A being replaced with arginine R .

The term derivative as used herein refers to peptides which have been chemically modified for example by ubiquitination labeling pegylation derivatization with polyethylene glycol or addition of other molecules. A molecule is also a derivative of another molecule when it contains additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the molecule. Such moieties can improve the molecule s solubility absorption biological half life etc. The moieties can alternatively decrease the toxicity of the molecule or eliminate or attenuate an undesirable side effect of the molecule etc. Moieties capable of mediating such effects are disclosed in RPS 21st ed. Tory ed. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 2006 .

The term functional when used in conjunction with derivative or variant refers to a protein molecule which possesses a biological activity that is substantially similar to a biological activity of the entity or molecule of which it is a derivative or variant. Substantially similar in this context means that the biological activity e.g. antigenicity of a polypeptide is at least 50 as active as a reference e.g. a corresponding wild type polypeptide e.g. at least 60 as active 70 as active 80 as active 90 as active 95 as active 100 as active or even higher i.e. the variant or derivative has greater activity than the wild type e.g. 110 as active 120 as active or more inclusive.

The term recombinant when used to describe a nucleic acid molecule means a polynucleotide of genomic cDNA viral semisynthetic and or synthetic origin which by virtue of its origin or manipulation is not associated with all or a portion of the polynucleotide sequences with which it is associated in nature. The term recombinant as used with respect to a peptide polypeptide protein or recombinant fusion protein means a polypeptide produced by expression from a recombinant polynucleotide. The term recombinant as used with respect to a host cell means a host cell into which a recombinant polynucleotide has been introduced. Recombinant is also used herein to refer to with reference to material e.g. a cell a nucleic acid a protein or a vector that the material has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous material e.g. a cell a nucleic acid a protein or a vector .

The term vectors refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting or mediating expression of a heterologous nucleic acid to which it has been linked to a host cell a plasmid is a species of the genus encompassed by the term vector. The term vector typically refers to a nucleic acid sequence containing an origin of replication and other entities necessary for replication and or maintenance in a host cell. Vectors capable of directing the expression of genes and or nucleic acid sequence to which they are operatively linked are referred to herein as expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility are often in the form of plasmids which refer to circular double stranded DNA molecules which in their vector form are not bound to the chromosome and typically comprise entities for stable or transient expression or the encoded DNA. Other expression vectors that can be used in the methods as disclosed herein include but are not limited to plasmids episomes bacterial artificial chromosomes yeast artificial chromosomes bacteriophages or viral vectors and such vectors can integrate into the host s genome or replicate autonomously in the particular cell. A vector can be a DNA or RNA vector. Other forms of expression vectors known by those skilled in the art which serve the equivalent functions can also be used for example self replicating extrachromosomal vectors or vectors which integrates into a host genome.

Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. The following is meant to be illustrative of the present invention however the practice of the invention is not limited or restricted in any way by the examples.

The recombinant Rhizavidin rRhavi used in these studies is an N terminal modified version that contains only the residues 45 to 179 of the wild type protein. To optimize the expression level of rRhavi in the gene sequence that encodes Rhizavidin polypeptides 45 179 was re designed by using preferred expression codons then synthesized and cloned into the PET21b vector. To facilitate the correct folding and obtain a high yield of soluble recombinant protein a DNA sequence encoding an periplasmic localization signal sequence 19 amino acids MKKIWLALAGLVLAFSASA SEQ ID NO 2 was introduced at the 5 end of the synthetic gene of rRhavi. This signal sequence is predicted to be deleted automatically from the recombinant protein after its targeting to the periplasm of during the process of expression.

A DNA sequence encoding a flexible linker region and His tag GGGGSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH SEQ ID NO 14 was directly inserted into the 3 end of the synthetic rRhavi gene. This helps for the purification of recombinant biotin binding protein. Furthermore an antigen can be inserted in the linker having a flexible linker on both sides e.g. the antigen can be inserted between amino acids S and V of the linker. As such the antigen is separated from the biotin binding protein by the peptide linker GGGGSSS SEQ ID NO 22 and from the His tag by the peptide linker VDKLAAALE SEQ ID NO 11 this can stabilize the fusion protein.

To construct Rhizavidin antigen fusion proteins a DNA sequence encoding a flexible linker region consisting of seven amino acids GGGGSSS SEQ ID NO 22 can be directly inserted into the 3 end of the synthetic rRhavi gene to help stabilize the fusion protein. The genes encoding candidate antigens full length or desired fragment were amplified from the genomic DNA of interested pathogens by routine PCR procedures and inserted into the rRhavi expression vector just beyond the linker region.

For protein expression the plasmids containing target constructs were transformed into strain BL21 DE3 using standard heat shock procedure. A single colony was picked freshly from the plate or a glycerol stock was used later and inoculated into 30 ml Luria Bertani LB medium containing Ampicillin Amp for an overnight culture at 37 C. On day 2 a 5 ml starting culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium Amp and grown at 37 C. until OD 1 was reached. After cooling the medium to 16 C. 0.2 mM final concentration of IPTG was added into the cultures for an overnight induction.

Proteins were purified from the periplasmic fraction using a modified osmotic shock protocol. Briefly the bacterial cells from the 6 liter culture were collected and re suspended in 120 ml buffer containing 30 mM Tris pH 8.0 20 sucrose and 1 mM EDTA. After stirring at room temperature for 20 min the cells were re pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as fraction 1 and the cells were re suspended in 80 ml ice cold solution containing 5 mM MgCl2 proteinase inhibitor and DNase. After stirring at 40 for 20 min the mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was collected as fraction 2. After adding a final concentration of 150 mM NaCl 10 mM MgCland 10 mM Imidazole the supernatant combining fraction 1 and fraction 2 was applied onto a Ni NTA column. The proteins eluted from the Ni NTA column were further purified by gel filtration using superdex 200 column running on AKTA purifier. The peak fractions containing target protein were pooled and concentrated. The protein concentration was measured by using BCA protein assay kit from Bio Rad. Purified proteins were aliquoted flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 C. for future use.

A lipidated derivate of recombinant biotin binding protein was produced using a method similar to the one described in Example 1. The lipidated derivate used in this study is an N terminal modified version of wild type Rhizavidin that contains only the residues 45 to 179 of the wild type protein. To optimize the expression level of rRhavi in the gene sequence that encodes Rhizavidin polypeptides 45 179 was re designed by using preferred expression codons then synthesized and cloned into the PET2 b vector. To facilitate the lipidation correct folding and obtain a high yield of soluble recombinant protein a DNA sequence encoding lipidation sequence 19 amino acids MKKVAAFVALSLLMAGC SEQ ID NO 3 was introduced at the 5 end of the synthetic gene of rRhavi. The lipidation will be added on the Cys residue of lipidation sequence by bacteria e.g. during the process of expression.

For protein expression the plasmid containing target constructs was transformed into strain BL21 DE3 using standard heat shock procedure. A single colony was picked freshly from the plate or a glycerol stock was used later and inoculated into 30 ml Luria Bertani LB medium containing Ampicillin Amp for an overnight culture at 37 C. On day 2 a 5 ml starting culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium Amp and grown at 37 C. until OD 1 was reached. After cooling the medium to 16 C. 0.2 mM final concentration of IPTG was added into the cultures for an overnight induction.

Lipidated rhizavidin was purified from membrane franction. cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer 20 mM Tris 500 mM NaCl pH 8.0 containing protease inhibitors Dnase 10 mM Mgand lysozyme. Cells were disrupted by one freeze thaw cycle and the supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 45 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5 SDOC and homogenized by beads beater. The lysates were then applied for centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 45 min and the supernatant was collected for affinity purification. Lipidated rhavi was eluted with lysis buffer containing 0.5 SDOC and 300 mM Im.

The proteins eluted from the Ni NTA column were further purified by gel filtration using superdex 200 column running on AKTA purifier. The peak fractions containing target protein were pooled and concentrated. The protein concentration was measured by using BCA protein assay kit from Bio Rad. Purified proteins were aliquoted flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 C. for future use.

The lipidated biotin binding protein produced is shown schematically in and SDS PAGE of the purified lipidated biotin binding protein is shown in .

TLR2 activity of lipidated biotin binding protein was tested in HEK TLR2 cells. HEK TLR2 cells were plated in 24 well plate at 5 10cells per well in 500 l volume. Lipidated biotin binding protein was added at different concentrations for stimulation at 37 C. overnight. The supernatants were collected the second day for IL 8 measurement by ELISA. As a control HEK 293 cells were used for stimulation at the same condition.

TLR2 activity of lipidated biotin binding protein was determined. Results showed that lipidated biotin binding protein induced production of IL 8 from HEK TLR2 but not from HEK 293 cells .

The DNA sequence encoding wild type Hla mature polypeptide amino acid 27 to 319 was cloned from genome. All non hemolytic mutants of Hla were generated by site directed mutagenesis using quickchange. To make Hla biotin binding fusion proteins the DNA sequence encoding wild type Hla or mutant Hla was inserted beyond the linker region followed biotin binding protein gene. All constructs were cloned into PET21b and transformed into for expression as described above.

Non hemolytic mutants of Hla were produced. The exemplary non hemolytic variants of Hla are shown schematically in . SDS PAGE of the purified wild type or non hemolytic variants of Hla and fusion protein is shown in .

The hemolytic activity of wild type Hla mutant Hla and their fusion proteins with biotin binding protein was analyzed using rabbit blood cells. Red blood cells from 250 l of rabbit blood were pelleted washed with PBS twice and then resuspended in 10 ml of PBS. Wild type Hla mutant Hla and fusion proteins were diluted with PBS at indicated concentrations and then added into 96 well plate at 100 l per well. Blood cells were added into 96 well plate containing Hla or fusion proteins at 25 l per well and then incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and analyzed by ELISA reader at OD450.

hemolytic activity of wild type Hla mutant Hla and their fusion proteins was assayed. Results demonstrate that mutant Hla have much lower hemolytic activity relative to wild type Hla . Further the Hla fusion proteins comprising a biotin binding protein had even lower hemolytic activity relative to the non fusion mutant Hla protein .

C57 WT macrophage cells were stimulated with non hemolytic Hla mutant fusion protein. Cells were seeded in 24 well plate at 5 10cells per well. Mutant Hla fusion protein was diluted with growth medium and added into wells at indicated concentration for stimulation at 37 C. overnight. Supernatants were collected the second day after centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and then analyzed for cytokine secretion by ELISA.

Stimularoty activity of mutant Hla fusion protein was analyzed. Results showed that mutant Hla fusion protein rhavi Hla209 induced production of multiple pro inflammatory cytokines including TNF IL 6 11 23 IL 1 and IL 17 .

MAPS based vaccine constructs were made from biotinylated serotype 1 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide rhizavidin fused TB antigens and either one from non lipidated rhizavidin lipidated rhizavidin or rhavi Hla209. Mice were immunized with different MAPS constructs and the T cell responses against TB antigens in different immunization groups were analyzed and compared after 3 immunizations. Briefly the whole blood from different mice groups were stimulated with purified TB proteins in vitro at 37 C. for 6 days and the cytokine concentration in the supernatant was detected by ELISA.

The results showed that the mice groups received MAPS complex containing lipidated rhizavidin or containing rhavi Hla209 generated better Th17 IL 17A and Th1 cell IFN responses to the TB antigens . This indicated that lipidated rhizavidin and rhavi Hla209 can act as a co stimulatior adjuvant in MAPS vaccine formulation.
