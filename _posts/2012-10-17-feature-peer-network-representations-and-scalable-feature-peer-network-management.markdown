title: Feature peer network representations and scalable feature peer network management
abstract: A device receives packets of an application flow, and inspects one or more of the packets of the application flow. The device determines, based on the inspection of the one or more packets, a service graph of feature peers for the packets of the application flow. The feature peers are associated with a network and the service graph includes an ordered set of the feature peers. The device creates a representation of the service graph. The representation includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent the feature peers of the service graph. The device provides the representation of the service graph to a controller device, and the controller device configures, based on the representation, the network with the service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse the service graph.

Initially a structure of services and or features offered over networks e.g. telecommunications networks the Internet etc. was directly between real computing and or storage hosts in what is commonly called the edge to edge principle. The services features were usually client server server server or client client oriented.

Intermediate network nodes provided in such networks operated only at the Internet layer e.g. routers or the link layer e.g. Ethernet switches using either routing or bridging protocols. Some of these networking protocols were augmented to implement various forms of virtualization such as virtual circuits and multiple access virtual private networks. These forms of network virtualization were achieved by adding header fields to packets such as Internet protocol IP tunnel headers multiprotocol label switching MPLS label stack headers and or extended Ethernet fields e.g. virtual local area network VLAN tags in conjunction with augmenting the routing and signaling protocols to distribute this information. This resulted in multiple logically separate or virtual networks often referred to as Virtual Private Networks VPNs .

Services features provided by networking and computing resources are often implemented as overlays on networks e.g. the Internet and or VPNs . Furthermore an enrichment of services has occurred with the rise of middle boxes or feature peers which operate above the Internet layer at the transport and or application layers. The feature peers may include gateways provided between VPNs and the Internet network address translation NAT devices firewalls intrusion detection devices proxies of various forms content filtering devices caches web acceleration devices multimedia transcoding and statistics collection devices etc. The feature peers as part of service structures i.e. feature networks deviate from the original edge to edge principle and require adherence to a different set of guiding principles to implement a reliable traffic engineered system that will achieve the goal of a converged service infrastructure.

Some networks provide packet and or application flow services and or features via one or more feature peers i.e. middle boxes that communicate amongst themselves and not necessarily with a client or server . Examples of such packet application flow services features include content related services e.g. voice audio and or video transcoding multi media conference bridging replication content filtering content recognition etc. security related services e.g. network based firewalls and or application layer gateways intrusion detection prevention and or mitigation denial of service detection prevention and or mitigation etc. flow rate and quality of service QoS related services e.g. metering policing shaping scheduling coordination with higher level signaling policy and configuration caching etc. statistics collection and accounting related services e.g. usage cap metering notification and or enforcement billing etc. administrative related services e.g. selective packet set capture replication redirection and or blocking packet inspection etc. proxy related services where a feature peer acts on behalf of a client and or server which is either temporarily off the network and or in a failure recovery state etc.

Such packet application flow services features may be managed via a star or flower network centered on a feature switch. In the star flower arrangement traffic to from a customer e.g. of a service or feature is directed into a set of feature peers by the feature switch. Such an arrangement may require configuration of the feature switch use configuration of tunnels and configuration of load balancing and may result in sub optimal performance. The star flower arrangement is expensive because the feature switch e.g. an access router a load balancer a tunnel gateway or a traffic steering application TSA executing on a server the routers and switches are traversed twice between each feature peer and the feature switch that connects to a customer and or a router on the edge of a data center connected to the Internet and or a virtual private network VPN . In the star flower arrangement there needs to be a tunnel for each feature peer since a tunnel identification ID determines a next feature peer or an exit to a data network. Furthermore the star flower arrangement can increase latency if the feature peers are not near the feature switch that connects to the customer and the feature switch that connects to the feature peers. The star flower arrangement requires a static configuration in the feature switch of tunnel IDs and next hops and is resilient only if a dedicated replica of the feature peers is provisioned. If a dedicated replica of the feature peers is not provisioned then reconfiguration is needed in response to failures e.g. load balancing across the feature peers requires reconfiguration and it is difficult to represent more complex feature topologies than a chain feature topology or is complex to implement dynamic feature networks also referred to as service graphs.

Packet application flow services features may also be managed via a service header based routing arrangement. In one example service header based routing arrangement a feature switch registers with a service broker and the service broker provisions a table e.g. of the feature switch to map customer packets to a service routing function e.g. associated with the feature switch . The service broker provisions service nodes with service header tunnel network and subscriber information consistent with provisioning of the service routing function for the feature switch and or edge router that connects to a destination of a customer in the network. The feature switch or edge router determines data network information and receives a packet from a customer e.g. from a device associated with the customer or from the Internet VPN. The access edge router uses the table to determine that the packet includes subscribed to services and directs the packet to the service routing function. The service routing function uses local configuration and packet information to determine a service header to be inserted encapsulates this within a tunnel header and forwards the packet to a first service node over the tunnel. The service node decapsulates the packet from the tunnel reviews the service header and configured information from the service broker to determine an outgoing tunnel and forwards the packet to the next service node. Eventually the packet returns to the access edge router that originally received the packet. The service routing function decapsulates the packet from the tunnel examines the service header and determines that the next step is forwarding. The access edge router then forwards the packet via the data network toward a destination address.

The service header based routing arrangement requires expensive changes to the software and or hardware of the access edge router in order to implement the service header insertion and processing and to make it behave as a feature switch. The service header based routing arrangement relies on a centralized service broker to determine download and monitor state and to optimize and load balance service node level routing across a set of service nodes. Centralization may limit a convergence time and responsiveness to change associated with the arrangement. Furthermore the service header based routing arrangement requires fault detection and restoration performance to be determined by the centralized service broker and may not be implemented across more than one service provider.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Systems and or methods described herein may enable forwarding of packets of an application flow e.g. traffic between an ordered set of feature peers e.g. the ordered set being referred to herein as a service graph and or a feature network in a more efficient manner than traditional load balancer access router and or traffic steering application methods. The systems and or methods may determine the service graph of feature peers based on inspection of the packets and may utilize a protocol e.g. the Openflow protocol or other similar protocols to configure network devices of a network with the service graph. The network devices may forward the packets of the application flow to the feature peers based on the service graph and without changing the application flow. The systems and or methods may create representations of the service graph and may share state information associated with the feature peers with other feature peers so that a redundant or backup service graph may be created with the other feature peers.

The systems and or methods may provide a one to N feature peer backup approach where a single feature peer may be a backup for N N 1 feature peers. In the one to N feature peer backup approach a pool of feature peers with high capacity access to resilient storage may be dynamically allocated by a service manager in response to feature peer and or network failures in a more efficient manner than a one to one backup approach. In the 1 to 1 backup approach network resources may be backed up in a one to one manner by redundant network resources.

The user device may include a radiotelephone a personal communications system PCS terminal a smart phone a personal digital assistant PDA a laptop computer a tablet computer a personal computer etc. The OFC may include one or more computation and communication devices that utilize a protocol e.g. the Openflow protocol or other similar protocols to configure the network devices with service graphs. The TSA may include one or more computation and communication devices that generate service graphs for directing packets through an ordered set of feature peers.

Each of the feature peers may include one or more computation and communication devices that provide packet application flow services features such as content related services security related services flow rate and QoS related services statistics collection and accounting related services administrative related services etc. For example a second feature peer FP 2 may provide statistics collection related services a third feature peer FP 3 may provide content filtering related services and a fourth feature peer FP 4 may provide security related services. The TSA may consult with an authentication authorization and accounting AAA device or a similar device to determine subscriber profiles user identification user location etc. in order to identify a set of packets to be directed to a particular service graph.

The destination address device may include a computation and communication device that is a destination of packets provided by the user device. In one example the destination address device may be provided in the Internet or a VPN. Each NAS may include a dynamic storage device and or a static storage device that may store information and or instructions for use by the feature peers a magnetic and or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive a solid state drive etc. The service manager may include a computation and communication device that controls operation of the NASs.

As further shown in a customer associated with the user device may wish to provide a packet of an application flow to the destination address device for delivery to for example a network e.g. the Internet a VPN etc. . A packet returned by the destination address device and destined for the customer may be processed in a similar manner in a reverse direction for the service graph which may differ from the forward direction. In one example the packets may need to traverse one or more of the feature peers before being provided to the destination address device. The TSA may inspect one or more of the packets of the application flow to determine a service graph for the packets of the application flow. The TSA may create a representation of the service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent the feature peers. The TSA may provide the service graph representation to the OFC and the OFC may configure based on the representation a network with the service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse the service graph. In one example the service graph may cause the packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the third feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to the destination address device.

As the packets of the application flow traverse the feature peers of the service graph the feature peers may provide feature peer state information to the NAS. The feature peer state information may include information generated by the feature peers during the processing of the packets of the application flow. For example the feature peer state information may include rules of content filtering applied to the packets of the application flow blacklists e.g. of blocked web sites whitelists e.g. of allowed web sites content filters associated with the customer signatures of web sites visited by the customer Internet protocol IP addresses to block encryption information firewall parameters etc. The NAS may receive and store the packets containing the feature peer state information.

As the packets of the application flow traverse the feature peers of the service graph the service manager may receive customer state information from the user device. The service manager may provide the customer state information to the NAS. The customer state information may include information generated by the user device during the processing of the packets of the application flow. For example the customer state information may include usernames and or passwords associated with the customer encryption information utilized by the customer IP addresses utilized by the customer customer account information usage thresholds and or usage rates associated with the customer session states associated with the customer a number of times the customer is blocked from a web site etc. The NAS may receive and store the packets containing the customer state information.

The NAS may replicate in the backup NAS the feature peer state information and or the customer state information. For example the NAS may provide duplicates of the feature peer state information and or the customer state information to the backup NAS. The backup NAS may receive and store the duplicates of the feature peer state information and or the customer state information. The backup NAS may be utilized in the event that the NAS becomes unavailable and may perform the functions of the NAS described herein. Each active feature peer and each feature peer in the backup pool may have access to a resilient shared state repository implemented in the NAS and the backup NAS. The storage of the NAS may be organized and indexed by individual customer a set of customers a shared infrastructure e.g. software image software feature parameters etc. that is common across all customers etc. The service manager may create and maintain the assignment of the NAS to feature peers supporting specific sets of customers. The service manager may create and maintain the configuration of resilient storage of state information in the NAS.

As further shown in the third feature peer may experience a failure or may become partially or fully disabled. The service manager may detect the failure e.g. via signaling or lack of signaling provided by the third feature peer . Based on the failure the service manager may select a backup feature peer e.g. backup FP 3 from a pool of backup feature peers and may provide to the backup feature peer information e.g. feature logic that enables the backup feature peer to provide the features of the failed feature peer. The service manager may instruct the backup feature peer to retrieve state information for the failed feature peer from the NAS. Based on the instruction the backup feature peer may retrieve the feature peer state information and or the customer state information from the NAS or the backup NAS if the NAS is unavailable.

The service manager may instruct the TSA and the OFC to modify the original service graph to exclude the failed feature peer e.g. the third feature peer and to include the newly instantiated backup feature peer. The TSA may create a representation of the modified service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent the feature peers. The TSA may provide the modified service graph representation to the OFC and the OFC may configure based on the representation the network with the modified service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse the modified service graph. In one example the modified service graph may cause the packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the backup feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to the destination address device. When the third feature peer becomes available again the original service graph may be reestablished and the utilized backup feature peer may become available for other feature peer failures.

Switching routing mechanism may interconnect input components with output components . Switching routing mechanism may be implemented using many different techniques. For example switching routing mechanism may be implemented via busses via crossbars and or with shared memories. The shared memories may act as temporary buffers to store traffic from input components before the traffic is eventually scheduled for delivery to output components .

Alternatively or additionally one or more components of device may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of device .

As shown in a customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device or another user device . In one example packets may need to traverse one or more feature peers before being provided to destination address device . TSA may consult with AAA and or may inspect one or more packets of the application flow to determine a service graph for packets of the application flow. In one example the service graph may cause packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the third feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to destination address device .

TSA may create a representation of the service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent feature peers . The feature elements may include generic notations for feature peers e.g. f where the 1 may be a feature peer identifier and s may be a specific service graph s packet ingress points e.g. i where s may be the specific service graph packet egress points e.g. e where s may be the specific service graph and data sources sinks e.g. d where the 1 may be a data source identifier and s may be the specific service graph . In one example feature elements that share a common feature peer identifier and or data source identifier may be aggregated when feature peers are assigned to a service graph.

Branching or alternation may be encoded to reduce a length of the shorthand notation since repeated sub paths in a full enumeration may be stated once. Branching may be important in dynamically monitoring and adjusting resources applied to implement a service graph since a fraction of traffic that utilizes a particular branch may not be specified. For example a content filter logging rate and a cache hit rate may vary substantially even if a traffic volume between user device and destination address device is specified in a service level agreement.

Service graph representation G may be represented as a set of Nservice subgraphs e.g. G g . . . g . Each service sub graph e.g. g P may include an ordered set of feature elements F e.g. feature peers links ingress egress points data sources etc. that originate and or terminate on a point or data that requires a profile P which may include a data structure e.g. a vector a matrix or a set of objects that describe characteristics of the service e.g. bandwidth storage volume storage access rate performance availability objective restoration etc. as defined by customer state information.

Provisioning a service graph may include mapping a service graph that meets one or more objectives that are subject to a set of constraints e.g. capacity performance etc. of a set of all service graphs onto a set of available resources with a particular profile e.g. capacity performance availability etc. . Network connectivity may include attributes and contexts that may vary because of where features are assigned to specific resources e.g. feature peers . For example if features are implemented in the same compute resource then no external networking may be required since communication may be between virtual machines. For resources provided in the same Ethernet bridged domain only network device capacity that implements Ethernet bridging may be required. For resources provided in different bridged domains network device capacity that implements IP routing functions may be required. For resources connected via feature networking e.g. in network device network device capacity may be required. Capacity may include constraints such as an allowable number of table entries a number of provisionable counters a number of supportable keep alive sessions etc. Network device may support other networking functions such as VPNs overlays and or interworking between different networking protocols.

As further shown in TSA may provide service graph representation to OFC and OFC may receive and store service graph representation . In one example implementation OFC may configure network devices in network to implement service graph representation as indicated by reference number . For example OFC may generate and provide forwarding instructions to network devices . The forwarding instructions may include instructions that instruct network devices to implement a service graph based on service graph representation . Based on the forwarding instructions network devices may forward packets of the application flow to the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and finally to destination address device .

As shown in the customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device . The packets may need to traverse one or more of feature peers before being provided to destination address device . An ordered set of feature peers e.g. service graph may be provided for the packets of the application flow. In one example service graph may cause the packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the third feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to destination address device . Alternatively or additionally user device may provide packets to another user device .

As the packets of the application flow traverse feature peers and of service graph feature peers and may provide feature peer state information to NAS . Feature peer state information may include information generated by feature peers and during the processing of the packets of the application flow. For example feature peer state information may include rules of content filtering applied to the packets of the application flow blacklists e.g. of blocked web sites whitelists e.g. of allowed web sites content filters associated with the customer signatures of web sites visited by the customer IP addresses to block encryption information firewall parameters etc. NAS may receive and store feature peer state information .

As the packets of the application flow traverse feature peers and of service graph service manager may receive customer state information from user device . Service manager may provide customer state information to NAS . Customer state information may include information generated by user device during the processing of the packets of the application flow and or from configuration of service specific parameters e.g. updates to a generic black list updates to generic white lists security threat signatures etc. . For example customer state information may include usernames and or passwords associated with the customer encryption information utilized by the customer IP addresses utilized by the customer customer account information usage thresholds and or usage rates associated with the customer session states associated with the customer a number of times the customer is blocked from a web site etc. NAS may receive and store customer state information and such information may be retrieved periodically and or pushed to feature peers that provide a service requiring this state data.

NAS may replicate in backup NAS and as indicated by reference number feature peer state information and or customer state information . For example the NAS may provide duplicates of feature peer state information and or customer state information to backup NAS . Backup NAS may receive and store the duplicates of feature peer state information and or customer state information . Backup NAS may be utilized in the event that NAS becomes unavailable and may perform the functions of NAS described herein. Each active feature peer and each feature peer in a backup pool may have access to a resilient shared state repository implemented in NAS and backup NAS . The storage of NAS may be organized and indexed by individual customer a set of customers a shared infrastructure e.g. software image software feature parameters etc. that is common across all customers etc. Service manager may create and maintain the assignment of NAS to feature peers supporting specific sets of customers. Service manager may create and maintain the configuration of resilient storage of state information in NAS .

As further shown in the third feature peer may experience a failure or may become partially or fully disabled. Service manager may detect the failure e.g. via signaling or lack of signaling provided by the third feature peer as indicated by reference number . Based on the failure service manager may select a backup feature peer e.g. backup feature peer from a pool of backup feature peers and may provide to backup feature peer information e.g. feature logic that enables backup feature peer to provide the features of the failed feature peer e.g. the third feature peer . Service manager may instruct backup feature peer to retrieve state information for the failed feature peer from NAS as indicated by reference number . Based on instruction backup feature peer may retrieve feature peer state information and or customer state information from NAS or backup NAS if NAS is unavailable.

Service manager may instruct TSA and OFC to modify original service graph to exclude the failed feature peer e.g. the third feature peer and to include the newly instantiated backup feature peer . TSA may create a representation of a modified service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent the feature peers. TSA may provide the modified service graph representation to OFC and OFC may configure based on the representation network with modified service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse modified service graph . In one example modified service graph may cause the packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the backup feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to destination address device . When the third feature peer becomes available again original service graph may be reestablished and the utilized backup feature peer may become available for other feature peer failures.

Such an arrangement may ensure that user device does not experience a service interruption despite a failure of one or more feature peers in original service graph . For example user device may continue to send the packets of the application flow to destination address device via modified service graph without experiencing a service interruption. Alternatively or additionally such an arrangement may ensure that feature peer state information and customer state information may be backed up in a one to N N 1 manner rather than a traditional one to one manner.

Alternatively or additionally when failure is detected failure may be addressed by relocating feature state information from one feature peer to another feature peer by adding a new feature peer by retrieving feature state information for the new feature peer by mapping application flows from the failed feature peer onto other feature peers and or by modifying the underlying network link connectivity.

Failure may occur when one or more feature peers and or connectivity in one or more feature peers are unavailable. Such unavailability may occur either because one or more feature peers are inoperable and or a failure of either hardware or software occurs within an infrastructure of network that causes one or more feature peers to be unreachable. An indication of failure may be in the form of direct alarm information e.g. a feature peer heartbeat has timed out an indication from a probe or a test session flow that a service graph has failed indirect alarm information e.g. a pattern is identified as a failure of one or more feature peers and or network connectivity etc.

In response to failure NAS may re provision service graph onto available feature peers provided in the pool of feature peers. Alternatively or additionally NAS may invoke session management to relocate certain user device sessions to equivalent service graphs in response to failure and or performance degradations. The relocation may occur with restoration priority and or specific performance objectives. Alternatively or additionally NAS may instantiate a new service graph and or attempt network link level connectivity in response to failure . Alternatively or additionally NAS may dynamically examine all impacted feature peers within service graph . NAS may locate alternate versions within service graph of feature peers and or connectivity between a feature peer and user device .

As further shown in a customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device . In one example the packets may need to traverse one or more feature peers before being provided to destination address device . In a traditional service chain implementation the packets of the application may be directed through TSA as shown by a traditional service path . In traditional service path TSA may direct the packets to features services implemented on feature peers . In one example traditional service path may provide the packets from user device to TSA and TSA may forward the packets to the fourth feature peer . The fourth feature peer may process the packets e.g. with features services available at feature peer and may provide the processed packets back to TSA . TSA may forward the packets to the third feature peer . The third feature peer may process the packets e.g. with features services available at feature peer and may provide the processed packets back to TSA . TSA may forward the packets to the second feature peer . The second feature peer may process the packets e.g. with features services available at feature peer and may provide the processed packets back to TSA . TSA may then forward the packets to destination address device . Packets provided by destination address device and destined for user device may traverse traditional service path in a reverse order or via another service path that may include the same feature peers another set of feature peers or the same set of feature peers in a different order.

Traditional service path implementation may be expensive because multiple server interfaces network device interfaces and paths across network must be traversed between TSA and feature peers . Furthermore configuration of TSA for traditional service path may be complex and error prone and may support only a static service graph.

Another traditional approach may include providing application stitching points in TSA between overlay paths which may allow development of arbitrary service graphs that vary over time. Although such an approach may be flexible and extensible packets may still traverse a significant number of interfaces e.g. on servers network devices etc. devices and paths which may not be required for all application flows. Furthermore in some cases TSA may need to recognize specific customers and or flows by interacting with AAA .

As further shown in TSA may communicate with OFC via an application programming interface API . OFC may communicate with and or configure network devices and or virtual switching functions in feature peers via a protocol such as the Openflow protocol . That is the network device switching and forwarding functionality of may be implemented on a dedicated or virtualized server as described in . TSA may receive packets of an application flow from user device and may inspect one or more of the packets and or may receive information from AAA . Based on the information received from AAA e.g. about the customer the packets the application flow etc. and or the inspection of the one or more packets TSA may determine a service graph for the packets of the application flow. In one example service graph may cause the packets to traverse the fourth feature peer the third feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to destination address device TSA may provide service graph to OFC via API .

OFC may receive service graph and may configure network devices to implement service graph . For example OFC may provide to network devices instructions to implement service graph . The instructions may cause network devices to forward packets generated by user device and or destination address device to one or more feature peers . For example the instructions may instruct network devices to forward packets from user device to the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and destination address device . Network devices may implement service graph without changing the application flow. Thus as shown in network devices may forward the packets of the application flow to the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and finally to destination address device . Configuring network devices with service graph may reduce costs since fewer interfaces may be traversed by packets traveling to from user device and or destination address device .

Alternatively or additionally one or more components of environment may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment .

As further shown in a customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device . In a traditional approach TSA may dynamically determine that the packets may be provided to a particular feature peer rather than to destination address device . For example TSA may determine that the packets may be provided to a closest cache server with available capacity e.g. the first feature peer . TSA may inspect the first packets and or sample packets of the application flow may consult with AAA and or may use other information to determine a traditional dynamic service path for the packets. However with traditional dynamic service path the packets of the application flow must still traverse TSA . Such an arrangement may not achieve a lowest cost for implementing the service structure and may require additional software development such as statistics collection from the cache server. Alternatively or additionally a dynamic service path may be created by inserting a transcoder in line with packets being sent to the customer so that capabilities of user device and the available bandwidth of the access network may be adjusted.

For application flows that occur frequently e.g. long lived application flows it may be desirable to avoid the cost of traversing unnecessary feature peers as well as TSA for each packet of the flow. TSA may receive the packets of the long lived application flow from user device . TSA may inspect the first packets and or sample packets of the application flow may consult AAA and or may use other information e.g. information about a closest cache server with available capacity . Based on the information received from AAA e.g. about the customer the packets the application flow etc. the other information and or the inspection of the first sample packets TSA may determine that the packets of the application flow need to be provided to the first feature peer e.g. a cache server or a transcoder . Based on this determination TSA may generate an openflow dynamic service graph for the packets of the application flow. In one example service graph may cause the packets to traverse between user device and the first feature peer . TSA may provide service graph to OFC via API .

OFC may receive service graph and may configure network devices to implement service graph . For example OFC may provide to network devices instructions to implement service graph . The instructions may cause network devices to forward packets between user device and the first feature peer . For example the instructions may instruct network devices to forward packets from user device to the first feature peer and may instruct network devices to forward packets from the first feature peer to user device . Thus as shown in network devices may forward the subsequent packets of the application flow between user device and the first feature peer . Service graph may bypass unnecessary feature peers e.g. feature peers and as well as TSA which may reduce cost. OFC may utilize time out and or polling of network devices to detect an end of the long lived application flow and or to collect statistics.

Alternatively or additionally one or more components of environment may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment .

Interfaces of an access network e.g. wireline or wireless associated with user device and interfaces of a service network e.g. Internet associated with destination address device may depend on the type of access network and whether the features services provided by feature peers have any state information e.g. customer identification connection type flow type identification etc. related to customers. When feature peers do not have customer state information application flow entries may be configured to be proportional to a number of service graphs a topology of a service graph etc. When one or more feature peers in a service graph include customer state information needed to process application flows then a mapping of customer addresses may be made to feature peers that include the customer state information. Additional packets communicated between TSA and feature peers and or directly communicated between feature peers may be used where customer state information is needed. In one example a feature peer may act as a repository e.g. a storage device shared across multiple feature peers for providing customer state information to service graphs.

In a wireline access network the mapping of the customer addresses may be provided because blocks of customer addresses may be assigned to edge network devices of network . The blocks of customer addresses may be used as prefix entries in the service graph to direct packets to feature peers that contain the corresponding customer state. In such a scenario service graph may be used.

In a wireless access network a customer may move between different cells e.g. base stations which may cause application flows associated with the customer to move between different interfaces on packet data network PDN gateways PGWs . Furthermore a customer may leave radio coverage and then return to radio coverage and an application flow from the same customer may appear with a different IP address at the same PGW and potentially on the same interface. In such a scenario TSA may determine an identification of a customer e.g. by intercepting a RADIUS or DIAMETER accounting message and or a pilot packet and may generate a service graph that directs packets to feature peers that contain state information associated with the identified customer.

As shown in a customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device . TSA may receive and inspect the packets of the application flow from user device and may determine an identification of a customer e.g. by intercepting a RADIUS or DIAMETER accounting message . Based on the identification of the customer and the inspection of the packets TSA may determine that the packets should be directed to feature peers that contain state information associated with the identified customer. TSA may consult with AAA and or may inspect some packets of the application flow to determine that the packets may require a tunnel e.g. a set of stacked VLANs a GRE tunnel with an embedded identifier an MPLS label stack an Ethernet PBB tag and or other packet fields used as a tunnel feature header to cause the packets to flow to feature peers that include the customer state information. The tunnel header portion e.g. a MAC address a destination IP address of a GRE tunnel or the uppermost label s in an MPLS label stack may be used to direct packets to the next node s in the service graph while the feature header portion may be used by the feature itself e.g. an inner and or outer VLAN a GRE tunnel key field or an MPLS label deeper in the label stack . Based on this determination TSA may generate a service graph for the packets of the application flow. In one example service graph may cause the packets to traverse TSA the fourth feature peer the third feature peer and the second feature peer before being provided to destination address device . TSA may provide service graph to OFC via API .

OFC may receive service graph and may configure network devices in network to implement service graph . For example OFC may provide to network devices instructions to implement service graph . The instructions may cause network devices to forward packets generated by user device to one or more feature peers . For example the instructions may instruct network devices to forward packets from user device to TSA the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and destination address device .

TSA may add or push tunnel feature headers to the packets as indicated by reference number before providing the packets to the first network device in service graph . Network devices may implement service graph by forwarding the packets of the application flow to the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and finally to destination address device . The last network device of service graph may remove or pop the tunnel feature headers from the packets as indicated by reference number before providing the packets to destination address device .

As shown in destination address device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to user device . TSA may receive and inspect the packets of the application flow from destination address device and may determine an identification of a customer associated with user device . Based on the identification of the customer and the inspection of the packets TSA may determine that the packets should be directed to feature peers that contain state information associated with the identified customer. TSA may consult with AAA and or may inspect some packets of the application flow to determine that the packets may require a tunnel e.g. a set of stacked VLANs a GRE tunnel with an embedded identifier an MPLS label stack an Ethernet PBB tag or other packet fields used as a tunnel feature header to cause the packets to flow to feature peers that include the customer state information. Based on this determination TSA may generate a service graph for the packets of the application flow. In one example service graph may cause the packets to traverse TSA the second feature peer the third feature peer and the fourth feature peer before being provided to user device . TSA may provide service graph to OFC via API .

OFC may receive service graph and may configure network devices in network to implement service graph . For example OFC may provide to network devices instructions to implement service graph . The instructions may cause network devices to forward packets generated by destination address device to one or more feature peers . For example the instructions may instruct network devices to forward packets from destination address device to TSA the second feature peer the third feature peer the fourth feature peer and user device .

TSA may add or push tunnel feature headers to the packets as indicated by reference number before providing the packets to the first network device in service graph . Network devices may implement service graph by forwarding the packets of the application flow to the second feature peer the third feature peer the fourth feature peer and finally to user device . The last network device of service graph may remove or pop the tunnel feature headers from the packets as indicated by reference number before providing the packets to user device .

Directing packets in such a manner may require use of a VLAN or a tunnel as provided by TSA which may cause the packets to flow through a service graph of feature peers that contain the customer state information. Network devices may push and pop a tunnel header on packets at each feature peer in the service graph. The last network device may pop the tunnel header before sending the packets to user device and or destination address device . The packet traversal of TSA and the initial pushing of a tunnel header on the packets may occur at different points depending upon a direction of the packet flow as illustrated in .

Although not as cost effective as service graph shown in the arrangement depicted in may be less expensive than having every packet traverse TSA for each feature peer as is the case in traditional approaches. Alternatively or additionally TSA may generate one or more service graphs that include feature peers with customer state information and feature peers without customer state information. Alternatively or additionally customers may require that a service graph be reliable and recover rapidly from failures. Current TSA based deployments often deploy a redundant set of feature peers connected by ports in a one to one redundancy configuration. In an example implementation feature peers may share restoration feature peer e.g. for shared access to customer state information where possible with a goal being to achieve a one to N redundancy configuration.

The match field may also include a priority associated with the entries in order to determine which action should be applied when multiple entries of the match field are met. When a match occurs with an entry in the match field the instructions in the action field and a corresponding set of one or more entries in the table field are performed. Entries of the table field may include for example forwarding to an outgoing port OutPort and changing a destination MAC DMAC address to be placed in the packet.

Network may forward the packets to feature peer and feature peer may process and return the packets to network . Network may forward the packets to feature peer and feature peer may process and return the packets to network . Network may remove the tunnel feature headers from the packets and forward the packets to destination address device . In one example destination address device may determine that features requested by the packets are available in feature peer . In response to the hypertext transfer protocol HTTP GET CONTENT message destination address device may generate a HTTP REDIRECT request e.g. requesting that the packets be redirected to feature peer and may provide the request to user device via a path that is the reverse of the path traversed by the packets not shown in .

Based on the REDIRECT request a second set of packet flows referred to as a transient packet flow may be generated. Transient packet flow may include user device providing packets e.g. a HTTP GET CACHE request to network and network providing the packets to TSA . TSA may invoke the API e.g. API with OFC and may forward the packets to feature peer based on communication with OFC . Feature peer may process the packets and may return the packets to network . Network may forward the packets e.g. a 200 OK response to user device . Network and OFC may exchange packets until OFC creates a shortcut packet flow .

A third set of packet flows may be referred to as shortcut packet flow . Shortcut packet flow may correspond to the packet flow shown and described in connection with . Shortcut packet flow may include user device providing packets e.g. a HTTP GET request to network and network providing the packets directly to feature peer e.g. rather than to TSA as in transient packet flow . Feature peer may process the packets and may return the packets to network . Network may forward the packets e.g. a 200 OK response to user device . When the packet flow stops network and OFC may exchange packets. For example network may provide to OFC an indication that a flow timer has expired and that a flow entry has been removed. Based on the indication OFC may retrieve usage statistics from network and may provide the usage statistics via additional packets to feature peer .

Based on shortcut packet flow packets from user device may be directed from user device to a cache server e.g. feature peer and back to user device and may bypass other feature peers . In this example a termination of the packet flow may be determined when a network device located at a user device facing edge of network detects that shortcut packet flow has timed out. At this point shortcut packet flow may be removed from forwarding instructions . For packets not addressed to DA Cache the packet flow described above in connection with may be utilized. If a packet is addressed to DA Cache the transient packet flow may be utilized until OFC creates the shortcut packet flow.

Service management function may support and or manage one or more service graphs which may be communicated to TSA . Service graph may include the features of the service graphs described herein in connection with one or more of .

Centralized service management of a large number of feature peers service graphs and link level connectivity may not meet restoration time objectives for some service availability contracts. In one example implementation restoration time objectives may be met by partitioning the service management into service management functions that interact with each other. Partitioning the service management may occur at multiple levels. At one level a service management function may be provided for each feature peer . Since a least cost resource assignment may assign feature peers and link level connectivity to resources in close proximity partitioning the service management at this level may cause feature peers and link level connectivity to be assigned to the same service management function . Service management partitioning may occur by resource type class and grouping by fungible resource types may maximize scalability.

Each service graph may be supported by a particular service management function SM and a union or some other combination U of all service management functions may constitute the service management SM e.g. SM U SM . Each service management function SM may be aware of its own managed set of service graphs G . A complete service graph G may be expressed as G UG. Each service management function SM may also maintain its own copy of the complete service graph G .

Each service management function SM may communicate with every other service management function SM as indicated by reference number . Communication may enable service management functions to exchange feature peer state information using a peer to peer P2P protocol or some other distributed database protocol. Based on communications and information received from service manager each service management function SM may maintain an updated copy of service graphs G as well as complete service graph G .

If a failure occurs in one of service graphs an alarm may be provided to a service management function supporting the failed service graph . For example one or more feature peers in service graph may fail which may cause service graph to provide alarm to service management function . Alarm may include information indicating that some feature peer s within service graph can no longer perform a service function. In one example service management function may provide alarm to the other service management functions . Alternatively or additionally service management function may provide updates to other service management functions deemed to be relevant e.g. affected by failure .

To determine relevant other service management functions service management function may examine a copy of service graph containing failure in one or more feature peers . Service management function may derive a set of service subgraphs G s G by examining the alarmed feature peers within service graph and may identify equivalent or backup feature peers for the alarmed feature peers . The backup feature peers may or may not be managed by service management function . Service management function may send e.g. via updates to other service management functions that manage each backup feature peer a modified service graph that includes the backup feature peers .

A service management function receiving the modified service graph may modify its copy of service graph to exclude the alarmed feature peers and may maintain the modified service graph . A service management function receiving the modified service graph may provide the modified service graph to one or more other service management functions .

Each service graph may include a distinct approach to maintaining state information accessing writing data using auxiliary services etc. Feature peers of a service graph which require resources from other feature peers may be ensured that the other feature peers are available. If a service graph requires a one hundred percent availability customers may be routed to backup feature peers in the event of failure without disrupting a service. In one example service management function may notify all customers using the failed feature peers and may instruct the customers to choose another service graph from a list of service graphs that is ordered based on proximity to the customers.

For example in an implementation described above in connection with a customer associated with user device may wish to provide packets of an application flow to destination address device . In one example packets may need to traverse one or more feature peers before being provided to destination address device . TSA may consult with AAA and or may inspect one or more packets of the application flow.

As further shown in process may include determining a service graph of feature peers for the packets of the application flow to traverse based on the inspection of the packet s block and creating a representation of the service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements representing the feature peers block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with TSA may consult with AAA and or may inspect one or more packets of the application flow to determine a service graph for packets of the application flow. TSA may create representation of the service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent feature peers . The feature elements may include generic notations for feature peers e.g. f where the 1 may be a feature peer identifier and s may be a specific service graph s packet ingress points e.g. i where s may be the specific service graph packet egress points e.g. e where s may be the specific service graph and data sources sinks e.g. d where the 1 may be a data source identifier and s may be the specific service graph .

Returning to process may include providing the representation of the service graph to a controller device where the controller device configures a network with the service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse the service graph block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with TSA may provide service graph representation to OFC and OFC may receive and store service graph representation . In one example OFC may configure network devices in network to implement service graph representation as indicated by reference number . For example OFC may generate and provide forwarding instructions to network devices . The forwarding instructions may include instructions that instruct network devices to implement a service graph based on service graph representation . Based on the forwarding instructions network devices may forward packets of the application flow to the fourth feature peer the third feature peer the second feature peer and finally to destination address device .

As shown in process may include receiving feature peer state information from feature peer s in a service graph associated with a user device block and receiving packets with customer state information associated with the user device block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with as the packets of the application flow traverse feature peers and of service graph feature peers and may provide feature peer state information to NAS . Feature peer state information may include information generated by feature peers and during the processing of the packets of the application flow. NAS may receive and store feature peer state information . As the packets of the application flow traverse feature peers and of service graph service manager may receive customer state information from user device . Service manager may provide customer state information to NAS . Customer state information may include information generated by user device during the processing of the packets of the application flow. NAS may receive and store customer state information .

As further shown in process may include providing duplicates of the state information in a backup storage device block and receiving an indication of a failure of a particular feature peer in the service graph block . For example in arm implementation described above in connection with NAS may replicate in backup NAS and as indicated by reference number feature peer state information and or customer state information . For example the NAS may provide duplicates of feature peer state information and or customer state information to backup NAS . The third feature peer may experience failure or inoperability that may prevent feature peer from processing the packets of the application flow. Service manager may detect failure e.g. via signaling or lack thereof provided by feature peer as indicated by reference number .

Returning to process may include instructing based on the indication backup feature peer s to retrieve state information block and instructing based on the indication a TSA to establish a modified service graph that includes the backup feature peer s block . For example in arm implementation described above in connection with based on the failure service manager may select a backup feature peer e.g. backup feature peer from a pool of backup feature peers and may provide to backup feature peer information e.g. feature logic that enables backup feature peer to provide the features of the failed feature peer e.g. the third feature peer . Service manager may instruct backup feature peer to retrieve state information for the failed feature peer from NAS as indicated by reference number . Service manager may instruct TSA and OFC to modify original service graph to exclude the failed feature peer e.g. the third feature peer and to include the newly instantiated backup feature peer . TSA may create a representation of a modified service graph that includes an ordered set of feature elements that represent the feature peers. TSA may provide the modified service graph representation to OFC and OFC may configure based on the representation network with modified service graph so that the packets of the application flow traverse modified service graph .

As shown in process may include establishing service management functions that support multiple service graphs each service graph including an ordered set of feature peers block and enabling the service management functions to communicate with each other block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with each of service management functions of service manager may support and or manage one or more service graphs . Service graph may include the features of the service graphs described herein. Each service management function SM may communicate with every other service management function SM as indicated by reference number . Communication may enable service management functions to exchange feature peer state information using a peer to peer P2P protocol or some other distributed database protocol.

As further shown in process may include receiving at a particular service management function an indication of a failure of a particular feature peer of a particular service graph block and identifying based on the indication a backup feature peer for the particular feature peer in order to create a modified service graph block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with if failure occurs in one of service graphs alarm may be provided to a service management function supporting the failed service graph . Alarm may include information indicating that some feature peer s within service graph can no longer perform a service function and or that feature peer s are not reachable by network devices . In one example service management function may provide alarm to the other service management functions . Alternatively or additionally service management function may provide updates to other service management functions deemed to be relevant e.g. affected by failure . Service management function may derive a set of service subgraphs G G by examining the alarmed feature peers within service graph and may identify equivalent or backup feature peers for the alarmed feature peers . The backup feature peers may or may be managed by service management function .

Returning to process may include providing the modified service graph to the other service management functions where the other service management functions implement the modified service graph block . For example in an implementation described above in connection with service management function may send e.g. via updates to other service management functions that manage each backup feature peer a modified service graph that includes the backup feature peers . A service management function receiving the modified service graph may modify its copy of service graph to exclude the alarmed feature peers and may maintain the modified service graph . A service management function receiving the modified service graph may provide the modified service graph to one or more other service management functions .

Systems and or methods described herein may enable forwarding of packets of an application flow between an ordered set of feature peers e.g. a service graph in a more efficient manner than traditional load balancer access router and or traffic steering application methods. The systems and or methods may determine the service graph of feature peers based on inspection of the packets and may utilize a protocol to configure network devices of a network with the service graph. The network devices may forward the packets of the application flow to the feature peers based on the service graph and without changing the application flow. The systems and or methods may create representations of the service graph and may share state information associated with the feature peers with other feature peers so that a redundant or backup service graph may be created with the other feature peers.
