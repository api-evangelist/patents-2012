This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 478 240 filed Apr. 22 2011 hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention relates to substituted pyrazolospiroketone compounds that act as inhibitors of an acetyl CoA carboxylase s and their use in treating diseases conditions or disorders modulated by the inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase enzyme s .

Acetyl CoA carboxylases ACC are a family of enzymes found in most species and are associated with fatty acid synthesis and metabolism through catalyzing the production of malonyl CoA from acetyl CoA. In mammals two isoforms of the ACC enzyme have been identified. ACC1 which is expressed at high levels in lipogenic tissues such as fat and the liver controls the first committed step in the biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids. If acetyl CoA is not carboxylated to form malonyl CoA it is metabolized through the Krebs cycle. ACC2 a minor component of hepatic ACC but the predominant isoform in heart and skeletal muscle catalyzes the production of malonyl CoA at the cytosolic surface of mitochondria and regulates how much fatty acid is utilized in oxidation by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Thus by increasing fatty acid utilization and by preventing increases in de novo fatty acid synthesis chronic administration of an ACC inhibitor ACC 1 may also deplete liver and adipose tissue triglyceride TG stores in obese subjects consuming a high or low fat diet leading to selective loss of body fat.

Studies conducted by Abu Etheiga et al. suggest that ACC2 plays an essential role in controlling fatty acid oxidation and as such it would provide a target in therapy against obesity and obesity related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. See Abu Etheiga L. et al. Acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 mutant mice are protected against obesity and diabetes induced by high fat high carbohydrate diets 100 18 10207 10212 2003 . See also Choi C. S. et al. Continuous fat oxidation in acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 knockout mice increases total energy expenditure reduces fat mass and improves insulin sensitivity 104 42 16480 16485 2007 .

It is becoming increasingly clear that hepatic lipid accumulation causes hepatic insulin resistance and contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Salvage et al. demonstrated that ACC1 and ACC2 are both involved in regulating fat oxidation in hepatocytes while ACC1 the dominant isoform in rat liver is the sole regulator of fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore in their model combined reduction of both isoforms is required to significantly lower hepatic malonyl CoA levels increase fat oxidation in the fed state reduce lipid accumulation and improve insulin action in vivo. Thus showing that hepatic ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance. See Savage D. B. et al. Reversal of diet induced hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance by antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors of acetyl CoA carboxylases 1 and 2 doi 10.1172 JCI27300. See also Oh W. et al. Glucose and fat metabolism in adipose tissue of acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 knockout mice 102 5 1384 1389 2005 .

Consequently there is a need for medicaments containing ACC1 and or ACC2 inhibitors to treat obesity and obesity related diseases such as NAFLD and type 2 diabetes by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and by increasing fatty acid oxidation.

The compound of formula IVa can then be formed by oxidation of the compound of formula Va with an appropriate oxidizing agent in an appropriate solvent. For example the compound of formula Va can be oxidized by treatment with Jones reagent in acetone at 0 C. to room temperature for a period of 15 minutes to 4 hours followed by extractive workup. The compound of formula IVa can then be debrominated by treatment with aqueous ammonium chloride and zinc metal in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran for 15 minutes to 4 hours typically at room temperature.

The compound of formula IIIa can then be deprotected to provide the free spiropiperidine derivative of formula IIa using standard methods which depend on which protecting group Pg has been employed. For example when Pg represents BOC standard strong acid deprotection conditions such as 4N hydrochloric acid in dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane can be used to remove the BOC group. When Pg represents Cbz hydrogenation over palladium on carbon in ethanol or treatment with a hydrogen source such as ammonium formate or 1 methyl 1 4 cyclohexadiene in the presence of palladium on carbon in ethanol or ethyl acetate can be employed to carry out the deprotection.

The spiropiperidine derivative of formula IIa can then be acylated by employing standard methods to provide the compound of formula Ia. For example the compound Ia may then be formed using a standard peptide coupling reaction with the desired carboxylic acid RCOH . For example the spiropiperidine intermediate IIa and carboxylic acid RCOH may be coupled by forming an activated carboxylic acid ester such as by contacting the carboxylic acid RCOH with a peptide coupling reagent such as O 7 azabenzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate HATU or 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethyllaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC.HCl in the presence or absence of an activating agent such as hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt and in the presence of a suitable base such as N N diisopropylethylamine DIEA triethylamine or N methylmorpholine NMM in a suitable solvent such as THF and or DMF dimethylacetamide DMA or dichloromethane and then contacting the activated carboxylic acid ester with the spiropiperidine derivative IIa to form a compound of formula Ia.

According to Scheme II reaction of the compound of formula VIIb with an appropriate hydrazine derivative R NHNHprovides the compound of formula VIb. The reaction is typically carried out in an appropriate solvent such as ethanol at an elevated temperature such as 60 C. to reflux for a period of about 1 to 48 hours to provide the compound of formula VIb. When the hydrazine derivative R NHNHemployed is in the form of its corresponding acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride salt it is to be appreciated that the compound of formula VIb formed may also exist as a salt. When the compound of formula VIb exists as the salt form it is typically treated with an appropriate base such as sodium bicarbonate in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane for 15 minutes to 4 hours at ambient temperature prior to conversion to the compound of formula Vb. The compound of formula Vb is formed by first reacting phosphorous oxychloride with dimethylformamide at 0 C. then adding the compound of formula VIb and cyclizing it at an elevated temperature such as 80 C. for a period of 1 to 24 hours. The compound of formula Vb is then converted to the corresponding methoxy bromo derivative of formula IVb by reaction with an appropriate brominating agent and methanol in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. For example reaction of the compound Vb with N bromosuccinimide in 20 methanol tetrahydrofuran for 30 minutes to 4 hours at ambient temperature can provide the compound of formula IVb. Treatment of the compound of formula IVb with an appropriate base such as potassium t butoxide in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran for 15 minutes to 2 hours followed by acidification with an appropriate acid such as 2N hydrochloric acid can provide the compound of formula IIIb. Deprotection of the compound of formula IIIb followed by coupling with the acid R2CO2H in the manner described previously in Reaction Scheme I provides the compound of formula Ib.

The compound of formula IIIc may be formed by palladium catalyzed cross coupling of the bromide of formula IVc with an alkyl or alkenyl tributylstannane such as methyl tri nbutylstannane or vinyl tri nbutylstannane or allyl tri nbutylstannane or a trialkyl boroxine such as trimethyl boroxine or trivinyl boroxine in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium 0 or a precatalyst and ligand combination such as palladium II acetate and 2 dicyclohexylphosphino 2 6 dimethoxybiphenyl SPhos and in the presence or absence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a protic solvent such as ethanol or t amyl alcohol or an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide at a temperature of about 20 C. to about 100 C. for about 2 hours to about 18 hours or at a temperature of about 100 C. to about 150 C. for about 5 minutes to about 60 minutes under microwave heating. If a alkenyl trialkylstannane or alkenyl boroxine is utilized to install the Rgroup reduction of the resulting olefin may be affected by hydrogenation over palladium on carbon in ethanol or treatment with a hydrogen source such as ammonium formate or 1 methyl 1 4 cyclohexadiene in the presence of palladium on carbon in ethanol or ethyl acetate.

The compound of formula IIIc may then be deprotected to provide the free spiropiperidine derivative of formula IIc using standard methods which depend on which protecting group Pg has been employed. For example when Pg represents BOC standard strong acid deprotection conditions. such as 4N hydrochloric acid in dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane can be used to remove the BOC group. When Pg represents Cbz hydrogenation over palladium on carbon in ethanol or treatment with a hydrogen source such as ammonium formate or 1 methyl 1 4 cyclohexadiene in the presence of palladium on carbon in ethanol or ethyl acetate may be employed to carry out the deprotection.

The spiropiperidine derivative of formula IIc may then be acylated by employing standard methods to provide the compound of Formula Ic. For example the compound Ic may then be formed using a standard peptide coupling reaction with the desired carboxylic acid RCOH . For example the spiropiperidine intermediate IIc and carboxylic acid RCOH may be coupled by forming an activated carboxylic acid ester such as by contacting the carboxylic acid RCOH with a peptide coupling reagent such as HATU or EDC.HCl in the presence or absence of an activating agent such as HOBt and in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA triethylamine or NMM in a suitable solvent such as THF and or DMF DMA or dichloromethane and then contacting the activated carboxylic acid ester with the spiropiperidine derivative IIc to form a compound of Formula Ic. Similar methodology can be employed to prepare the corresponding N1 analogues where Ris on N1 of the pyrazole ring rather than on N2 as shown in Reaction Scheme III .

The ACC inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention can be confirmed in vivo by evaluation of their ability to reduce malonyl CoA levels in liver and muscle tissue from treated animals.

Measurement of malonyl CoA production inhibition in experimental animals can be determined using the following methodology.

In this method male Sprague Dawley Rats maintained on standard chow and water ad libitum 225 275 g were randomized prior to the study. Animals were either fed or fasted for 18 hours prior to the beginning of the experiment. Two hours into the light cycle the animals were orally dosed with a volume of 5 mL kg 0.5 methyl cellulose vehicle or with the appropriate compound prepared in vehicle . Fed vehicle controls were included to determine baseline tissue malonyl CoA levels while fasted animals were included to determine the effect fasting had on malonyl CoA levels. One hour after compound administration the animals were asphyxiated with COand the tissues were removed. Specifically blood was collected by cardiac puncture and placed into BD Microtainer tubes containing EDTA BD Biosciences N.J. mixed and placed on ice. Plasma was used to determine drug exposure. Liver and quadriceps were removed immediately freeze clamped wrapped in foil and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Tissues were pulverized under liquid Nto ensure uniformity in sampling. Malonyl CoA was extracted from the tissue 150 200 mg with 5 volumes 10 tricarboxylic acid in Lysing Matrix A MP Biomedicals PN 6910 in a FastPrep FP120 Thermo Scientific speed 5.5 for 45 seconds . The supernatant containing malonyl CoA was removed from the cell debris after centrifugation at 15000 g for 30 minutes Eppendorf Centrifuge 5402 . Samples were stably frozen at 80 C until analysis was completed.

Analysis of malonyl CoA levels in liver and muscle tissue can be evaluated using the following methodology.

This method may be performed utilizing the following equipment. Two dimensional chromatography using an Agilent 1100 binary pump an Agilent 1100 quaternary pump and two Valco Cheminert 6 port two position valves. Samples were introduced via a LEAP HTC PAL auto sampler with Peltier cooled stack maintained at 10 C. and a 20 L sampling loop. The needle wash solutions for the autosampler were 10 trichloroacetic acid in water w v for Wash 1 and 90 10 methanol water for Wash 2. The analytical column Sunfire was maintained at 35 C. using a MicroTech Scientific Micro LC Column Oven. The eluent was analyzed on an ABI Sciex API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with Turbo Ion Spray.

Two dimensional chromatography was performed in parallel using distinct gradient elution conditions for on line solid phase extraction and reversed phase chromatography. The general design of the method was such that the first dimension was utilized for sample clean up and capture of the analyte of interest followed by a brief coupling of both dimensions for elution from the first dimension onto the second dimension. The dimensions were subsequently uncoupled allowing for gradient elution of the analyte from the second dimension for quantification while simultaneously preparing the first dimension for the next sample in the sequence. When both dimensions were briefly coupled together the flow of the mobile phase in the first dimension was reversed for analyte elution on to the second dimension allowing for optimal peak width peak shape and elution time.

The first dimension of the HPLC system utilized the Phenomenex strata X on line solid phase extraction column and the mobile phase consisted of 100 mM sodium perchlorate 0.1 v v phosphoric acid for solvent A and methanol for solvent B.

The second dimension of the HPLC system utilized the Waters SunFire C18 reversed phase column and the mobile phase consisted of 100 mM ammonium formate for solvent A and methanol for solvent B. The initial condition of the gradient was maintained for 2 minutes and during this time the analyte was transferred to the analytical column. It was important that the initial condition was at a sufficient strength to elute the analyte from the on line SPE column while retaining it on the analytical. Afterwards the gradient rose linearly to 74.5 A in 4.5 minutes before a wash and re equilibration step.

Mass spectrometry when coupled with HPLC can be a highly selective and sensitive method for quantitatively measuring analytes in complex matrices but is still subject to interferences and suppression. By coupling a two dimensional HPLC to the mass spectrometer these interferences were significantly reduced. Additionally by utilizing the Multiple Reaction Monitoring MRM feature of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer the signal to noise ratio was significantly improved.

For this assay the mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a TurboIonSpray voltage of 2250V. The nebulizing gas was heated to 450 C. The Declustering Potential DP Focusing Potential FP and Collision Energy CE were set to 60 340 and 42 V respectively. Quadrupole 1 Q1 resolution was set to unit resolution with Quadrupole 3 Q3 set to low. The CAD gas was set to 8. The MRM transitions monitored were for malonyl CoA 854.1 347.0 m z L. Gao et al. 2007 853 303 313 and for malonyl C CoA 857.1 350.0 m z with dwell times of 200 ms. The eluent was diverted to the mass spectrometer near the expected elution time for the analyte otherwise it was diverted to waste to help preserve the source and improve robustness of the instrumentation. The resulting chromatograms were integrated using Analyst software Applied Biosystems . Tissue concentrations for malonyl CoA were calculated from a standard curve prepared in a 10 solution of trichloroacetic acid in water.

Samples comprising the standard curve for the quantification of malonyl CoA in tissue extracts were prepared in 10 w v trichloroacetic acid TCA and ranged from 0.01 to 1 pmol L. Malonyl C CoA final concentration of 0.4 pmol L was added to each standard curve component and sample as an internal standard.

Six intra assay quality controls were prepared three from a pooled extract prepared from fasted animals and three from a pool made from fed animals. These were run as independent samples spiked with 0 0.1 or 0.3 pmol L C malonyl CoA as well as malonyl C CoA 0.4 pmol L . Each intra assay quality control contained 85 of aqueous tissue extract with the remaining portion contributed by internal standard 0.4 pmol L and C malonyl CoA. Inter assay controls were included in each run they consist of one fasted and one fed pooled sample of quadriceps and or one fasted and one fed pooled sample of liver. All such controls are spiked with malonyl C CoA 0.4 pmol L .
