The user may allocate tags for identifying user s personal medicines including the user medicine of which recognition training is completed by the server and which is added into the user s personal medicine information as a new personal medicine in operation . An operation of allocating tags to user s personal medicines between the user device and the server may be performed according to the flowchart .

In operation the user device may check whether the user medicine is newly registered as a user s personal medicine in the user s personal medicine information of the server . In operation if the user medicine is newly registered as a user s personal medicine the user device may receive a unique tag for identifying the user s personal medicine from the user. In operation the user device may transmit to the server tag information of the newly added user s personal medicine. In operation the server may store the received tag information by matching it to a result of the recognition training of the medicine appearance recognition module. In operations and the server and the user device may transmit and receive a message informing that a tag is completely allocated to the user s personal medicine that is newly registered in the user s personal medicine information.

A method of providing a user s personal medicine information management service by a user device by a server and by the user device and the server will now be described with reference to in conjunction with the .

In operation the user device obtains a medicine image captured by photographing appearance of a user medicine. The user device may photograph a medicine or a medicine package. In operation the user device transmits the medicine image to the server as a request for recognition of the user medicine.

In operation the user device receives medicine quantity information and user s personal medicine information from the server based on a result of the recognition of the user medicine. If the user medicine is recognition trained by the server in advance and thus is already registered in the user s personal medicine information identification information of the user medicine from among pieces of the user s personal medicine information may be received. Also non prescription medicine product information and personal medication information such as a medicine taking history of the user from among pieces of the user s personal medicine information may be received.

In operation the server receives from the user device a medicine image captured by photographing appearance of a user medicine as a request for recognition of the user medicine. In operation the server analyzes the received medicine image and reads the appearance and a remaining quantity of the user medicine.

In operation the server transmits to the user device medicine quantity information and user s personal medicine information stored in the server based on a result of the reading. That is in addition to identification information and quantity information read from the medicine image the server may extract and transmit non prescription medicine product information and personal medication information such as a medicine taking history of the user from among pieces of the user s personal medicine information stored in the server .

Also the server may update the medicine taking history from among pieces of the user s personal medicine information based on the medicine quantity information read from the medicine image.

In operation a user captures a medicine image by photographing a user medicine by using the user device and uploads the captured medicine image to the server e.g. a cloud server. As such a request for recognition training of the user medicine may be transmitted to the server in operation .

In operation the server stores and analyzes the received medicine image and extracts an image showing appearance of the user medicine and reads a remaining quantity of the user medicine from the medicine image. The server may read the image showing the appearance of the user medicine and may extract identification information of the user medicine. The server may search user s personal medicine information and may check whether the read image showing the appearance of the user medicine is included in the user s personal medicine information.

In operation the server may store quantity information read from the medicine image into the user s personal medicine information and may update a medicine taking history of the user.

In operation the server may transmit to the user device the quantity information and the identification information read from medicine image as a response. Also the server may extract product information or personal medication information such as the medicine taking history related to the user medicine from the user s personal medicine information and may transmit the product information or the personal medication information to the user device .

In operations and the user device may check whether the recognition of the user medicine is completed based on the response of the server . If the recognition of the user medicine is completed an operation of recognizing the user medicine between the user device and the server is completed. If the recognition of the user medicine is not completed the method returns to operation and a new medicine image may be captured by photographing the user medicine and may be transmitted as a new request for the recognition of the user medicine.

The server is a service enabling server for providing various M2M services between different devices by realizing an intelligent network for associating an Internet service with external communication networks of user devices including mobile terminals.

The server mainly includes an M2M mobile operator MMO mobile network operator MNO service interface unit an M2M service open application programming interface API module management unit a service implementation module management unit a networking management unit and a service integration unit .

The server may transmit and receive data to and from the user devices based on an M2M protocol. The user devices implement M2M communications based on an M2M protocol and thus may include all devices capable of receiving various M2M services provided by the server . For example the user devices may include for example a smart phone a tablet PC a camera camcorder a display device such as a TV a kitchen appliance such as a refrigerator a home network including a user s home network and an accessible external home network a vehicle and an exercise equipment .

The server performs data communication with an MMO management server of a communication carrier which is located outside a home network and manages MMO or MNO services via the MMO MNO service interface unit .

MMO MNO service providers for operating the MMO MNO services are mobile carriers for providing mobile communication services by using mobile communication networks constructed by other mobile carriers. An MMO MNO service provider provides MMO MNO services using existing mobile communication networks makes profits from membership fees call charges and supplementary service charges of customers and pays providers of the mobile communication networks for fees for using the mobile communication networks.

For example the MMO MNO service interface unit may transmit or receive device management information to or from the MMO management server based on an MMO specific protocol. The MMO MNO service interface unit may include an MMO server management unit for managing at least one MMO management server that provides MMO MNO services to the server and a data management unit and an error control unit for respectively managing and controlling data and errors generated while receiving services of the MMO management server .

The MMO server management unit may provide a common interface for external MMO service providers who want to provide MMO MNO services via the server .

The networking management unit may include a user management unit a device management unit and a connectivity management unit and may manage user information device information and connectivity states to form a network with the user devices . The networking management unit may observe and manage states of the user devices and may control operations of the user devices .

The service integration unit integrates various services provided by a service provider server in order to integrally provide various M2M services. The service integration unit may include a main service plug in module and a web service plug in module in order to provide web services provided by external service providers as well as main services provided by an operator of the server . Data communication with the service provider server e.g. an operation of downloading applications from the service provider server may be performed via the main service plug in module and the web service plug in module . The web service plug in module may provide a common interface for external service providers such as external website operators.

The M2M service open API module management unit of the server provides an M2M service interface in the form of an API as a common interface for integrating and organizing various M2M services provided to the user devices . In order to be freely used by external service providers and to be functionally extended later the M2M service interface may be provided in the form of an open API. Accordingly service providers may implement M2M services such as mashup services by using the M2M service open API provided by the M2M service open API module management unit and the service integration unit may integrally manage M2M services of various service providers.

The service implementation module management unit may manage profiles for implementing various M2M services provided by the server . The service implementation module management unit may manage service profiles such as web applications for implementing the main services and the external web services which are integrated by the service integration unit .

The service implementation module management unit may provide a home device management profile for managing and controlling home devices of the user a living and health management profile for managing information regarding living and health of the user and controlling related devices and a vehicle management profile for managing various states of a vehicle of the user e.g. driving security and maintenance states as M2M services provided by the server .

One of integrated M2M services provided by the server is the user s personal medicine information management service provided by the server or illustrated in or . For example the user s personal medicine information management service provided by the server or may be implemented by the living and health management profile of the server and the user device or illustrated in or are examples of the user devices and may implement the user s personal medicine information management service by using the living and health management profile of the server .

The service implementation module management unit may generate a new service profile by combining individually implemented service profiles. For example a refrigerator management service implemented by the home device management profile may provide a service for searching for food kept in a refrigerator and a body fat management service implemented by the living and health management profile may provide a service for providing diet menus to reduce body fat of the user. Although the refrigerator management service and the body fat management service are basically implemented as separate services the server may associate the refrigerator management service and the body fat management service with each other and may implement a new service for searching for food for managing body fat of the user in the refrigerator.

Since other communication carriers may easily access a local network such as the home network of the user devices via the common interface for mobile carriers and the open API for service providers which are provided by the server various convergence services in which the local network of the user devices is connected to and associated with external networks may be implemented and be provided to the devices .

Also since the server manages users and the user devices of a local network at an upper level of the local network and controls connection and association between the local network and external networks various convergence services provided by different service providers may be individually or integrally provided to the user devices .

As described above information regarding user s personal medicines may be integrated and thus identification information and personal medication information such as a medicine taking history regarding the user s personal medicines may be managed.
