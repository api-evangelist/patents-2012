title: System and method for electronic auditing
abstract: A system for performing insurance policy audits electronically. The system optimizes service selection by tailoring an audit to an insured's business category and state(s) in which the insured does business. Initially, the insured is sent a letter and password to enter the system website. Once online, the insured is prompted to answer questions to complete the audit in a self-driven manner. Insureds can save work in progress and return to the audit later. The interactive process drives the methodology for insureds to complete the audit online, resulting in a more accurate audit at a lower average cost.

This application claim priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 436 054 filed Jan. 25 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In an insurance policy audit certain records of the insured are audited to verify that they match what appears on the insured s insurance application and what the insurance carrier believes the insured s risk to be. Previous insurance policy audits have presented insureds with a predetermined list of questions regardless of the insured s type of business. These questions are determined in advance and thus do not allow tailoring an audit to an insured s specific type of business. A method is therefore desired that will increase the accuracy of the determination of the insured s exposure base.

The present system comprises a web driven system designed to perform insurance policy audits electronically. The system optimizes service selection by tailoring an audit to an insured s business category and state s in which the insured does business.

Initially the insured is sent a letter and password to enter the system website. Once online the insured is prompted to answer questions to complete the audit in a self driven manner. Insureds can save work in progress and return to the audit later. The interactive process drives the methodology for insureds to complete the audit online resulting in a more accurate audit at a lower average cost.

The input interface responds to requests from controller to get data from management system database . Controller runs on processor and is aware of the API and or database queries required to communicate with database server . Controller coordinates actions between the client browser and other system modules. In particular there are three data flows managed by the controller 

The present audit system is dynamic in that the flow of questions is determined by user insured responses as the user proceeds through the audit. A screen selector which in one embodiment is an application controlled by controller provides the appropriate next or previous screen for the controller to send to the client browser . Screens are the pages of the audit flow which are displayed via client browser . These screens are forms which can be implemented and modified by a front end developer.

Screen selector incorporates a simple state machine which takes the current state including the current screen and other variables such as business type and maps the current state to a next state in which the next screen to display on client browser is indicated. State machine determines each successive state based on the previous state and one or more answers to questions supplied by the insured. The screen selector also provides a previous state if for example the user needs to go back to an earlier screen in the flow. This functionality may be implemented for example as a script with logic a database lookup table or a combination of both.

Database is used for managing all audit process assignments to be performed hereinafter termed work orders . Each work order contains specific information on the insurance policy being audited such as the policy number policy period class codes policyholder info etc. This data is used to complete the work orders. Once a work order is received in database area a subset of the work order information that is necessary for the insured who is also a user of the present system to complete the corresponding audit is sent to a work order data store in database . Document repository area in document database stores completed audit documents and any attachments that are submitted by the insured to support the audit information provided.

When the audit is complete controller sends the results from results store to document repository via output Interface . The output interface understands the database queries and or APIs application programming interfaces for storing the audit results into the document repository .

In one embodiment in order to get feedback on the design and usability of the online audit an analytics data collector application or script is used to track user activity throughout the audit process. Online user behavior is monitored in an effort to refine the procedural flow. In one embodiment client side scripts running on the client browser send event notifications to the server. These event notifications are sent as packets which may include the user ID the current screen ID an event code a question ID a timestamp and other parameters. Event types may include navigation between screens navigation between fields and exiting the audit process. The analytics data collector script on web server receives these events and records them in the analytics database .

At step the system requests an insured s industry type. At step the insured selects the industry type from a list of types of industries such as non profit organization hospitality industry transportation industry etc. The industry type determines which subsequent questions the insured is asked and the insured response drives further subsequent questions to be asked related to that specific industry for workers compensation or general liability purposes. The industry type also drives various exposure base adjustments that are particular to the selected industry type. For example certain questions such as those pertaining to the insured s product can drive subsequent questions related to installation service and repair etc.

At step the system requests the name of each state in which the insured operates and the insured responds by entering the state name s at step . The state selection drives subsequent actions including additional questions related to various exposure base adjustments that may be applicable for each individual state selected by the insured. The state selection industry type selected plus the insured s answers to questions presented during the present audit determines the exposure base adjustment entries that populate an exposure spreadsheet.

At step the system begins an iterative process of requesting and receiving information from the insured. The requested information is entered by the insured at step and the system verifies that the data entered by the insured is responsive to the corresponding questions at step . If at step the data entered by the insured is not acceptable e.g. if the requested information has not been completely supplied then at step the system requests re entry or complete entry of the data requested in step .

If at step the data entered by the insured is acceptable then at step a check is made to determine whether all requests for information have been made by the system and answered by the insured and steps and are repeated as necessary. Finally at step the system performs the insurance policy audit using the information entered by the insured.

At step the next screen is sent to browser and the insured selects their industry type from one of multiple industry tracks . The industry track selection determines the appropriate questions to ask for that particular industry which will drive subsequent data entry screens. At step the next screen is sent to browser and the user selects the state or states in which the insured s business operates. The state selection determines the exposure base adjustment entries that populate columns in an exposure spreadsheet according to a chart of state exceptions.

Some general questions are then asked and then in step industry specific questions are sent to browser that are determined based upon the industry selection above. The insured also provides a description of operations in a text box. The number of employees the insured has will drive the setup of the exposure worksheet. In response to subsequent screens sent to browser the insured then enters officer principal information.

At step the insured is provided with a selection of class codes to enter based on policy information. The insured selects the appropriate class code that matches each exposure type that was entered. At step in response to questions on one or more additional screens the insured enters all necessary exposure adjustments for the industry type and state s selected. At step the system requests and the insured then enters non employee exposure if any.

A summary screen is then sent to the user who then verifies the information that was entered. The user must check a box to confirm that all data entered was accurate to the best of their knowledge and then submits the audit to system at step . At step once the audit is submitted all data entered by the insured is transferred to an auditing application executing on processor . A mapping application under control of the auditing application extracts the information from fields in the various screens submitted by the user and then automatically transfers the information into the appropriate field within the auditing application. A completed audit file is then generated without any human intervention by auditing application using information entered by the insured and the audit file is stored in document repository .

At step the audit file is then returned to the insurer via a system to system feed into an insurer s computer system using an Internet connection for example . In one embodiment at step information in the audit file is directly populated into the insurer s policy billing system via either the system to system feed or by insurer s computer system . A billing statement for the insurer is automatically generated for example by the insurer s billing system using the information from the audit file at step .

Having described the present system and method in detail and by reference to specific embodiments thereof it will be apparent that modifications to the system and method and variations thereon are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. It is therefore contemplated that the present system is not limited to the specifically disclosed aspects thereof.
