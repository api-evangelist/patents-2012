title: Alignment of static parts in a gas turbine engine
abstract: A first structural static component having an outer diameter is aligned with a second structural static component having an inner diameter to the centerline of a gas turbine engine rotating assembly. The first static component is centered inside the second static component leaving a gap between the outer diameter of the first component and the inner diameter of the second component to permit them to mate at operating temperatures. Tabs and slots are placed on the periphery of the static components to align the static components with the centerline at build temperature.

This invention was made with government support under N00019 06 C 0081 awarded by U.S. Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Alignment of the structural static components of a gas turbine engine to the centerline of its rotating assembly is critical to the performance and reliability of the engine. There have been two general ways to achieve this needed alignment.

One method is to use concentric diameters where one cylindrical face the outer diameter or OD of the smaller part fits into another cylindrical face the inner diameter or ID of the larger part . This type of alignment is called a pilot. The advantage of the pilots is that they can center a part very precisely. The disadvantage is that the accuracy is dependent on the temperature and coefficient of thermal expansion for each material at build and all running conditions of the engine. Use of materials with significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion has not been possible using this alignment method because the gap between the ID and the OD is too large at start up when the engine is cold. Thus there is no alignment and the engine could fail.

The second method is the use of a radially instanced geometric feature such as tabs and slots. The advantage of tabs and slots is that they can be employed under a wide range of temperatures and load conditions. The disadvantage is that this method is not as precise as the use of pilots due to manufacturing limitations. Especially with the use of materials with significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion at operating temperatures vibration and wear would cause the tabs to eventually fail.

Typically one or the other of the alignment methods is used for each component interface. The material and the temperature range of each component involved in the fit have in the past determined which of these two alignment methods is used. However as noted above neither is effective alone.

It has now been discovered that gas turbine engines can be made and used with effective alignment between two materials having very dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion using the method of this invention. For the first time it is possible to manufacture and use an engine with for example a titanium diffuser and a nickel alloy seal plate.

Specifically the present invention comprises the use of both 1 a pilot alignment with a difference between the OD of the outer piece and the ID of the inner piece to be large enough so that under operating conditions at maximum operating temperatures the OD and ID mate to provide complete alignment and 2 the use of tabs and slots to align the inner and outer piece during assembly and cold startup.

Turbine nozzle is held in place by a seal plate with pressure on nozzle . Seal plate prevents combustion gases from returning to compressor .

A diffuser locates the seal plate . Both seal plate and diffuser need to be concentric and aligned with the centerline of a gas turbine engine at all times and all temperatures even though their coefficients of thermal expansion might be significantly different. Diffuser serves to increase the pressure of the compressed air delivered to the combustor.

Also shown in are tabs located at four locations circumferentially spaced on the periphery in this example that mate into slots . In the build temperature has slot holding tab so that seal plate and diffuser are aligned and gap can be seen. As the temperature is increased during operation of the engine and gap narrows until the seal plate OD and diffuser ID. mate. Thus the alignment of seal plate and diffuser is maintained regardless of the temperature of the two components.

The present invention has been shown to work with seal plates and diffusers of significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion such as titanium and nickel alloy both at ambient start up temperatures and at maximum operating temperatures. This allows manufacture and use of engines having less weight and lower cost while improving the alignment of the static components and thus the performance of the engine.
