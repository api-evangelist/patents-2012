The present invention belongs to the technological field of paper printing in particular to paper wrappers for smoking articles more particularly to paper wrappers for self extinguishing smoking articles also called Low Ignition Propensity or LIP and specifically to the flexographic printing technique.

The manufacture of LIP paper wrappers for smoking articles by means of printing strips is based on the transference of a liquid ink from a printing form to the paper. The aim is to stop the cigarette burning when the combustion cone reaches the printed band under the conditions defined by the ASTM E2187 and ISO 12863 standards. To achieve this goal the printing has to reduce the gas exchange between the atmosphere and the lit tobacco.

This gas exchange takes place through the pores of the paper and so the reduction of this gas exchange entails the closure of these pores to a certain extent. This reduction can be measured using air permeability measurements or gas diffusion capacity measurements. To simplify the term diffusivity shall be employed in this specification to mean diffusion capacity . The instruments currently available to measure diffusivity use carbon dioxide and nitrogen and they measure the rate of diffusion of the former in the latter through the printed band.

In the field of paper wrappers for smoking articles air permeability is measured using the CORESTA n 40 method adopted as standard by the industry. This method measures the volume of the air flow passing through a defined surface over a given length of time when a pressure difference is applied between both faces of the substrate. These measurements are usually given in ml min cm at a pressure difference of 1 kPa. This is the so called CORESTA Unit or CU.

On the other hand the diffusivity D of a gas through a substrate measures the molecular exchange rate between both faces of the substrate among which there is no pressure difference. Such measurements are usually given in cm s. Currently this method is not an industry standard.

One important difference between both measurements is that whereas the natural permeability of the paper is influenced by all its pores independently of their size only small pores which are approximately up to 10 microns in diameter influence diffusivity. The pores referred to as pinholes in the terminology used in the cigarette paper field those pores with a size larger than approximately 10 microns in diameter a size large enough to be visible when the paper is observed through the light hardly have any influence on diffusivity or on the combustion rate of the cigarette. The latter is evidenced by the fact that when the cigarette paper is perforated using the spark discharge method known as electrostatic perforation a process that produces perforations of approximately 10 to 80 microns the combustion rate of the cigarette does not increase and diffusivity only increases very slightly no matter how much its air permeability increases. However the ventilation of the cigarette does increase. Therefore in theory diffusivity would be a more suitable measurement of the combustibility of the cigarette than air permeability. Consequently the industry tends to use it to predict the combustibility of the cigarette with increasing frequency.

In this context the most relevant parameters defining a cigarette paper wrapper are its permeability to air and its diffusivity because they correlate best with the smoke ventilation during the consumption of the cigarette by the smoker and with the static combustion rate of the cigarette and therefore they affect to its tar and nicotine content directly. Higher air permeability and diffusivity values imply a greater open pore area.

On the basis of the above explanation it is logical to come to the conclusion that the higher the air permeability and the diffusivity of the paper the greater the need for material applied onto it to achieve the desired reductions of air permeability and diffusivity.

Papers with a high air permeability of over 50 CU present the problem of making compatible the amount of solids needed in the ink with its viscosity because as mentioned in patent EP1417899 A very important parameter to be taken into account when printing a paper by any method is the viscosity of the ink. In techniques such as heliogravure or flexography there is a limitation related to the viscosity ink meaning that those inks with high viscosity levels do not facilitate the transfer of the ink to the stretch to be printed or from there to the printing form or to the paper depending on the system used. Moreover a high ink viscosity causes a loss of definition of texts and small drawings. Therefore when selecting a binder besides its specific effect of reducing the air permeability of the paper its ignition tendency and its influence over cigarette taste the corresponding limitation of viscosity should also be taken into account. As there is a direct relationship between the solid content of a solution and its viscosity the viscosity limit is interpreted as a limit to the solids in the ink and therefore a limit to the amount of material applied to the paper. 

In order to overcome this problem the system commonly used applies various consecutive layers to the same area as described in patent EP 1333729. The main problem this configuration presents is that it is difficult to control the stability of the printing conditions when using various inkwells at the same time. This is why it would be advantageous to use only one inkwell.

EP 1333729 shows as the only advantage of this configuration the reduction of wrinkles produced in any printing using a water based ink on paper and even more substantially when a large amount of ink is applied to a light weight cigarette paper about 24 28 g m . The present invention is advantageous in that it is not necessary to align the inkwells. This means that the inkwells are aligned in such a way that in the final drawing the different colors are in exactly the place they should be so that the drawing is not blurry. This advantage provides a greater control of the operation and makes it more versatile for example by allowing to change the inkwell in case problems arise with the inkwell on use.

The object of the present invention is a single layer printing method of an ink on a wrapper for smoking article to obtain a wrapper with low propensity to ignition by employing the flexographic technique characterized in that the printing is carried out using a central drum flexographic printing machine using only one printing group with an anilox with a capacity of between 10 and 40 cm mand a printing cylinder equipped with a printing form also characterized in that an ink is used which comprises at least one film forming substance and one mineral filler. Said printing form may be a group made of a plastic film known as a stencil plate glued to the printing cylinder with an adhesive or a hollow cylinder or sleeve manufactured from a polymeric material that is introduced into the printing cylinder.

The film forming substance preferably gum arabic may be present in the ink in a percentage comprised between 40 and 95 by weight of the ink solids preferably between 50 and 90 g mand more preferably between 60 and 85 g m being the upper and lower limits included in all the indicated intervals.

The filler preferably calcium carbonate may be present in the ink in a percentage comprised between 5 and 60 by weight of the ink solids preferably between 10 and 45 g mand more preferably between 15 and 38 g m being the upper and lower limits included in all the indicated intervals.

The ink may furthermore comprise a combustion agent. Said combustion agent may be present in the ink in a percentage comprised between approximately 2 and 10 by weight of the ink solids preferably between 2.5 and 6 g mand more preferably between 3.4 g mand 3.6 g m being the upper and lower limits included in all the indicated intervals.

According to particular embodiments the combustion agents may be for example salts of organic acids such as citric maleic lactic acetic tartaric acids and other similar acids. The inventors have found that citric acid salts are especially useful in the invention especially the metal salts of citric acid such as sodium and potassium citrates and more particularly potassium citrate.

In the procedure of the invention between 0.5 and 7 g mof solids are deposited on a paper wrapper for smoking articles preferably between 0.8 and 4 g mand even more preferably between 1 and 3.8 g m being the upper and lower limits included in all the indicated intervals.

The ink may be applied onto the paper wrapper for smoking articles continuously in straight wavy or zig zag bands or in any other way which ensure that the cigarettes manufactured with this paper wrapper do extinguish.

Using the single layer printing method of this invention the areas treated with the ink herein disclosed have a diffusivity of between 0.010 and 0.300 cm s.

According to a preferred embodiment of the single layer printing method of this invention the ink comprises 

According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the single layer printing method of this invention the ink comprises 

Printing by means of the flexographic technique with central drum is based on the application of one ink or several inks using various printing groups placed around a central drum outside which the material to be printed moves.

Other components of each printing group are an ancillary reservoir pipes an inkwell and a scraper or a scraper chamber according to the specific design of the printing machine.

The ink is transferred to the anilox the excess ink is removed by means of a scraper the ink goes to the printing form and from there to the support to be printed.

If the ink fills all the cells of the anilox and the excess ink is completely removed the transfer of the ink to the support will be regulated by the pressure between the anilox and printing form by the pressure between the printing form and the support and by the material and the hardness of the printing form.

Depending on the printing conditions the ink transfer the percentage of weight of dry ink on the support over the weight of dry ink on the anilox may vary between 30 and 50 .

This is a system based on the application of the ink from an embossed form on the support to be printed. Therefore the pressure of the printing form on the support is a variable that greatly affects the final printing.

On the other hand the pressure of the anilox on the printing form also influences the final printing although in a lesser way. For example a 20 micron increase in the positioning of the anilox relative to the printing form results in a 4.7 reduction in diffusivity.

The influence of the positioning of the printing cylinder relative to the support that is to say the pressure of the printing form on the support on diffusivity is due to two factors 

The first factor is regulated by the pressure between the anilox and the printing cylinder and between the printing cylinder and the support. The second factor is regulated by the latter only.

The most important advantages obtained by using a printing method like that of the present invention which uses only one printing group to obtain a single layer of ink as opposed to multi layer printing methods are as follows

As already stated above the most relevant parameters defining a cigarette paper are its permeability to air and its diffusivity given that these parameters correlate best with the static combustion rate of the cigarette and with the smoke ventilation upon the consumption of the cigarette by the smoker. Therefore they influence directly the tar nicotine and carbon monoxide contents of cigarettes. Higher air permeability and diffusivity values imply a larger open pore area.
