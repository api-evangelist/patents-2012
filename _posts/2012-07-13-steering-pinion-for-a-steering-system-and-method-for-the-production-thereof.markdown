This application is a national stage of International Application No. PCT EP2012 063841 filed Jul. 13 2012 which claims priority from German Patent Application No. 10 2011 079 274.0 filed on Jul. 15 2011 in the German Patent and Trademark Office the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a steering pinion for a steering system of a motor vehicle and a method for the production of such a steering pinion.

Steering pinions as coupling connections between the steering shaft and the gear rack of a motor vehicle are known in the prior art. These steering pinions are provided in order to transmit to a gear rack the torque applied to the steering shaft by the driver via the steering wheel. The gear rack in turn acts via the track rods to swivel the corresponding wheels of the vehicle. Such a steering pinion accordingly comprises a toothed section which meshes with the teeth of the gear rack and a connection section which connects the steering pinion to the steering shaft. The toothed section typically has helical toothing which is meshed with corresponding toothing in the gear rack.

In the prior art steering pinions are formed in one piece and are typically manufactured from a material which has high strength in order to achieve reliable functioning and a long service life in the toothed section.

In this context GB 953 793 is cited as an example which shows such a steering pinion. The steering pinion which it discloses is formed as a single part and in accordance with its use is formed from a high strength material.

DE 10 2009 029 407 A1 discloses a method for manufacturing a steering pinion by initial machining of a semi finished product then a subsequent rolling operation. The steering pinion is formed as a single part.

From U.S. Pat. No. 3 688 374 a method of producing a one piece steering pinion by cold forming is known.

Furthermore from DE 102 60 426 B3 a one piece steering pinion is known which is produced by cold or hot working.

Typically the diameter of the toothed section is greater than the diameter of the shaft and the connection section. When a conventional steering pinion is produced high processing costs are accordingly incurred since the connection section must be formed to the lower diameter either by turning or by laborious reshaping.

From US 2007 0068726 A1 a steering apparatus with electrical steering support is known wherein a steering pinion is provided which has a pinion side shaft and a torque side shaft which are linked together by means of a linking pin.

The present disclosure describes a steering pinion which can be produced using a reduced amount of material and with reduced production costs and provides a method for producing such a steering pinion.

The steering pinion which can be used as a coupling connection between the steering shaft and gear rack of a motor vehicle comprises a toothed section for meshing with a gear rack and a connection section for connecting to a steering shaft. According to the present disclosure a toothed part having the toothed section and a connection part having the connection section are provided wherein the toothed part and the connection part are pressed together in a rotationally fixed manner.

By forming the steering pinion from two components namely the toothed part having the toothed section and the connection part having the connection section both the toothed part and the connection part can be formed in accordance with the demands placed respectively upon each. Thus the steering pinion can be produced using a reduced amount of material.

In particular the toothed part may be manufactured using a solid piece of high grade material so that the toothed part and in particular the toothing itself can withstand the operational loads. The connection part on the other hand can be formed from a less high grade material and be hollow.

Furthermore the division of the steering pinion into a toothed part and a connection part enables its production to be simplified since the connection part can be supplied already with the desired thickness and or with the desired diameter with the result that appropriate turning of the shaft or laborious reshaping of the connection section of the connection part is unnecessary.

Because the parts are pressed together in a rotationally fixed manner it is further possible to dispense with separate method steps for producing the rotationally fixed connection. For example the insertion of a pin a bolt or another connection means can be dispensed with so that production can be simplified. Furthermore the pressing together creates a fully play free connection at least with respect to rotation which enables precise functioning of the steering and a long service life to be achieved. Accordingly in one embodiment the connection is made by pressing together without additional connecting components or additional securing components.

In order to further simplify production while still achieving a rotationally fixed connection which satisfies the demands placed upon a steering pinion the connection part and the toothed part advantageously overlap. In particular a fixing section of the toothed part overlaps with a fixing area of the connection part. The steering pinion can accordingly be produced by pushing the toothed part into the connection part and subsequently pressing them together.

The connection between the toothed part and the connection part is in one embodiment formed to be durable and not disassemblable. The term not disassemblable is to be understood here as meaning that the design of the connection is such that no disassembly of the toothed part and the connection part is provided. In particular disassembly and subsequent reassembly is not provided. It can thus even be conceivable and possible that the toothed part and the connection part cannot be disassembled in a manner that would allow them to be subsequently reassembled. In this case disassembly of the connection between the connection part and the toothed part cannot therefore be carried out without destroying the parts.

In order further to improve the resistance to rotation between the toothed part and the connection part the fixing section can have at least one material elevation for example in the form of a knurl and or a nub and or a roller burnished region.

In an embodiment in the fixing section and or the fixing area material elevations and or material depressions are provided such as nubs knurls roller burnished regions and or grooves to increase the available torque transmission. By the use of such connecting means positive locking for the connection can be provided in addition to non positive locking.

In a further advantageous embodiment in order to increase the available torque transmission the fixing section and or the fixing area are formed conically.

In order to reduce the material costs and the weight of the steering pinion the toothed part and the connection part can in an embodiment use different materials and thereby be efficiently adapted to their different tasks.

Less weight combined with reliable functioning results when the toothed part is manufactured from a solid piece and the connection part is formed from a tube. In this case the toothed part can be manufactured in a cold forming process. Cost effective provision of the connection part is also achieved due to the widespread and inexpensive availability of tubes with standard dimensions.

Simple production and reliable functioning result if the connection part and the toothed part are connected to each other either non positively or both positively and non positively. An even simpler production can be achieved by the fixing of the connection part to the toothed part by a pressing operation only. In an embodiment the fixing section is at least in part conical in order to facilitate assembly.

The toothed part in an embodiment has a depression for example a groove and or a recess around all or part of its circumference into which material of the connection part is introduced such as by knurling and or roller burnishing and or pressing on and or rolling in order to form a positive connection as a protection against separation.

In an exemplary embodiment the depression can have at least one serration or knurl in order to enable the creation of a connection between the connection part and the toothed part that is as rotationally fixed as possible.

The toothed part in an embodiment has a bearing seat to accommodate a rolling bearing which can serve as a radial bearing and or an axial bearing for the steering pinion.

In another embodiment the rolling bearing is held compressively between the connection part and the toothed part and in this manner retained positively and under pre tension between the connection part and the toothed part. In this case the rolling bearing is particularly retained positively in the radial direction and under pre tension in the axial direction.

In yet another embodiment the connection part and the toothed part are pressed together in a rotationally fixed manner and the rolling bearing is simultaneously clamped or pre tension is applied such that it is retained fixedly with its inner ring on the steering pinion. In other words pressing the connection part and the toothed part together in a rotationally fixed manner can at the same time achieve secure fixing of the rolling bearing.

The term pressed together in a rotationally fixed manner is understood here to mean that the connection part and the toothed part are connected by the pressing and the non positive locking resulting therefrom and in one embodiment the press fit that is formed in such a manner that the torques applied via the connection part can be transmitted to the toothed part via the connection that is formed by pressing. A certain amount of positive locking can additionally be provided in particular by pressing above a knurled or roller burnished section or by means of an additional possible rolling of material into a serrated section.

A method for the production of a steering pinion with a toothed section for meshing with a gear rack and a connection section for connecting to a steering shaft comprises the steps of providing a toothed section having the toothed part and providing a connection section having the connection part. The toothed part and the connection part are subsequently connected together in a rotationally fixed manner and the parts are pressed together in order to produce the rotationally fixed connection.

In this manner a reliable production method is provided by means of which a steering pinion can be produced with efficient use of material.

A rolling bearing can be accommodated prior to the connection of the toothed part with the connection part on a bearing seat of the toothed part. In one embodiment the rolling bearing is pressed between the toothed part and the connection part with the application of pre tension to the rolling bearing.

In order to provide protection against the connection being pulled apart at least one depression such as in the form of a groove and or a recess can be formed in the toothed part and material of the connection part can be introduced into the depression in particular by roller burnishing or by framing a bead. In this case the circumferential edges of the depression in the form of a circumferential groove can in one embodiment have a serration into which the pressed on connection part is introduced as it is roller burnished or rolled into shape thus providing an additional positive connection.

In an exemplary embodiment the method for the production of a steering pinion with a toothed section for meshing with a gear rack of a motor vehicle steering system and with a connection section for connecting the steering pinion to a steering shaft comprises at least the following steps providing a toothed part having the toothed section and a fixing section providing a connection part having the connection section and a fixing area wherein a receptacle in the form of an opening for receiving the fixing section of the toothed part is formed in the fixing area forming a material elevation such as in the form of a roller burnished region and or a knurl on the fixing section such that the material is elevated beyond the original external diameter of the fixing section and its inscribed diameter is greater than the internal diameter of the opening of the connection part and pressing the fixing area together with the fixing section to form a non positive connection.

In an exemplary embodiment the receptacle in the form of the opening is perfectly cylindrical and the diameter of the opening is enlarged by less than 0.2 mm during the pressing. The term perfectly cylindrical is to be understood in the present disclosure to mean a shape which deviates from an exact cylindrical shape only by normal manufacturing tolerances.

In one embodiment prior to the connection of the toothed part with the connection part a rolling bearing can be accommodated on a bearing seat of the toothed part. In this manner a particularly efficient production of the steering pinion can take place.

Examples of embodiments are described below with the aid of the figures. In the figures elements which are identical or similar or have identical effects are designated with identical reference signs and repeated description of these elements is in part dispensed with in the description below in order to avoid redundancy.

The steering movements of the steering wheel are transmitted via a steering shaft to a steering pinion which has a toothed area which meshes with a gear rack . The rotation of the steering pinion causes the gear rack to move translationally along its axis. The gear rack is connected to track rods which in turn transmit the translational movement of the gear rack into a steering movement of the schematically shown wheels .

The steering forces can be increased and or assisted by a power steering system or . In the example embodiment of a typical steering system that is shown the schematically indicated power steering systems are disposed between the steering wheel and the steering pinion . A power steering system can thereby either provide pure power assistance or alternatively or in combination with this function it can also increase the steering angle when this is demanded by the applicable control system of the motor vehicle.

The steering shaft is usually formed from multiple parts and extends from the steering wheel to the steering pinion with the installation path of the steering shaft adapted by means of universal joints to the installation conditions of the particular motor vehicle.

The steering pinion must depending on the configuration and design of the applicable steering system for example transmit large torques of up to 250 Nm. For this reason in the prior art each steering pinion is formed as a single part manufactured by metal cutting processes from a solid piece and usually additionally hardened in order to ensure that it is capable of the demands placed upon it to transmit the high torques with the required precision in steering the motor vehicle as well as having a high degree of stability and an adequate service life.

The steering pinion is accordingly provided as a coupling connection between the steering shaft and the gear rack . In order to be able to fulfill this function it has a toothed section for meshing with the gear rack and a connection section for connecting to the steering shaft .

In an embodiment the connection section of the connection part is as seen in tapered relative to the remainder of the shaft of the connection part and has a ribbing in order to ensure that the connection to the steering shaft is rotationally fixed. Besides the ribbing that is shown other measures affecting the geometry can also be used to achieve an adequately rotationally fixed connection capable of being assembled and disassembled between the connection part and a steering shaft . In an exemplary embodiment the ribbing is in the form of a spline or a polygon. This spline or plurality of surfaces and flat sections formed as a polygon may be produced in a reforming process by pressing or hammering. Production by means of a high internal pressure method is conceivable and possible. To assemble the connection part with the steering shaft a screwed bolt not shown here in the Figures is normally provided. The connection part further has a fixing area in which a receptacle in the form of a cylindrical opening is disposed. At the end of the connection part that faces away from the connection section an end face is formed which surrounds the opening and serves as a shoulder in the steering pinion .

The toothed part has in the area of the toothed section helical toothing which is intended to mesh with the gear rack of the steering system. Rotation of the steering pinion and in particular of the toothed part accordingly brings about translational movement of the gear rack . Although helical toothing is depicted in the example embodiment that is shown it is also possible to use any other toothing that enables the transmission of force from the toothed part to the gear rack .

The connection part and the toothed part are connected to each other in a rotationally fixed manner by being pressed together such that a press fit is formed. The connection part and the toothed part overlap in a fixing area of the connection part and a fixing section of the toothed part as can be seen in .

In an embodiment this connection between the toothed part and the connection part is formed to be durable and not disassemblable. The term not disassemblable is to be understood in the present disclosure to mean not that disassembly is completely impossible but that the design is such that disassembly and subsequent reassembly of the disassembled parts is not intended.

The formation of a rotationally fixed press fit is aided by the provision of material elevations such as nubs a knurl or a roller burnished region in the fixing section of the toothed part . The fixing area and or the fixing section can also be formed slightly conically over at least part of its length in order to simplify the formation of a press fit when pressing the two components together and so facilitate assembly.

In order to provide alongside the formation of a rotationally fixed connection protection from axial displacement or against the pulling apart of the toothed part relative to the connection part protection against pulling apart in the region for example in the form of a circumferential beading is provided by means of which the connection part is fixed to the toothed part in the direction of pulling apart or in the direction of the axis of the steering pinion . The precise formation of the protection against pulling apart region will be described in the context of the descriptions of the example embodiments in .

Protection against pulling apart of the connection part and the toothed part can additionally be achieved by the press fit such that in a particular embodiment the pressing of the connection part onto the toothed part is sufficient in itself to protect against disassembly.

To support the steering pinion in the housing of the steering gear a bearing is provided. In one embodiment at least one rolling bearing is used. This rolling bearing can be formed in a simple manner integrally with the steering pinion of the present disclosure. To achieve this the rolling bearing is in an embodiment disposed between the connection part and the toothed part . The rolling bearing is positioned by means of a first shoulder disposed on the toothed part and by means of a second shoulder formed by the end face of the connection part which faces the toothed part . The rolling bearing is retained between the toothed part and the connection part by the pressing together of the toothed part with the connection part . In an exemplary embodiment a pre tension is applied in this manner by the two above mentioned parts to the rolling bearing with the result that the rolling bearing is retained non positively between the connection part and the toothed part .

In addition to the rolling bearing which serves as a radial bearing a further bearing can be provided which serves as an axial bearing. This bearing can be formed as a sliding bearing or as a rolling bearing.

The bearing can also be a radial bearing in addition to an axial bearing. It is conceivable and possible to provide the axial bearing in the rolling bearing and dispense with the bearing .

In the embodiment shown in a further example of a steering pinion with a toothed part and a connection part is shown in which the connection part is formed from a tube. In this case the connection section is produced by a flattening and tapering of the tube so that a connection of the steering shaft to the connection section can be made by means of a receptacle in the steering shaft which cooperates with the connection section .

In order in addition to the rotationally fixed connection to achieve fixing and security in an axial direction protection against pulling apart region is also provided such as in the form of non circumferential depressions.

The fixing section of the toothed part is also shown onto which the complementary fixing area of the connection part is pushed or pressed in a subsequent operation. The fixing section here shows a depression into which material of the connection part can flow in order to produce here a positive connection in the axial direction of the steering pinion between the connection part and the toothed part . By this means additional pre tension can also be applied to the rolling bearing in order to retain the rolling bearing in the desired position.

The fixing section further shows a flattened cross sectional geometry which is suitable for forming an alternative rotationally fixed connection.

In order to be able to fix the rolling bearing during the production of the steering pinion in a precise manner and for its entire service life the inner race of the rolling bearing is fixed under pre tension on the bearing seat between a shoulder disposed on the toothed part and the shoulder which is formed by the end of the connection part which faces the rolling bearing . The pre tension is in one embodiment applied during the pressing of the toothed part together with the connection part and maintained by the resulting press fit.

The formation of a rotationally fixed press fit of the tube shaped connection part on the fixing section of the toothed part can in one embodiment be achieved by providing material elevations on the fixing section of the toothed part which provide an additional non positive and in one embodiment also positive connection between the connection part and the toothed part . The material elevations are for example in the form of nubs but may be in the form of a knurl such as shown in or in the form of a roller burnished region such as shown in .

The embodiment shown in shows an additional embodiment of a steering pinion . In this embodiment a circumferential beading is provided in the connection part which forms the protection against pulling apart region . The protection against pulling apart region in the form of the beading is disposed in the connection part in a position corresponding to a depression or groove below it in the toothed part . Accordingly the beading which serves as the protection against pulling apart region is formed around the entire circumference of the connection part and in this manner provides reliable protection against pulling apart. By means of a beading operation material from the connection part which is formed as a tube is rolled into the depression which is in the form of a circumferential groove so that material flows into the groove.

The flowing of material into the groove also applies further pre tension to the rolling bearing which as a result can be retained fixedly in its position.

A beading operation of this kind can form the circumferential beading around the depression in a simple manner using a roller indicated schematically which is set in rotation. The material of the connection part accordingly flows into the depression of the toothed part . By means of such rolling the strength of the connection between the connection part and the toothed part can also be increased over the entire area of the fixing section and the fixing area . The stresses acting in the axial direction provide a corresponding material flow which also forces material into the depressions between the material elevations. In addition pre tension is applied to the rolling bearing to fix the rolling bearing between the shoulder of the toothed part and the shoulder of the connection part .

Particularly in it is clear to see that not only is the rolling bearing retained on the toothed part by being pushed onto or accommodated on the bearing seat but also in particular that a corresponding pre tension is applied by the pressed on connection part which provides a positive locking fit and a corresponding pre tension by directly abutting the rolling bearing in the area of the bearing seat with the result that the rolling bearing is also fixed in place when the connection part is pressed onto the toothed part .

In it can also be seen that not only is the tube shaped connection part pressed onto the fixing section of the toothed part in order to achieve a rotationally fixed connection but also in the area of the protection against pulling apart region material from the connection part is introduced into a depression in the form of a recess. The material of the connection part is simply pressed into the depression in this manner to produce a positive locking fit as protection against pulling apart.

In it can again be seen clearly that the rolling bearing is positively retained in the steering pinion by the connection part . For this purpose in the toothed part a shoulder which the rolling bearing abuts is formed in the end of the bearing seat facing away from the fixing section . Accordingly the rolling bearing is held compressively and thereby securely retained between the shoulder and the shoulder which is formed by the end of the connection part . A pre tension is in one embodiment applied to the rolling bearing in the axial direction with the result that it is retained securely.

Because the toothed part is formed from a solid piece and the connection part is formed as a conventional tube the steering pinion can be produced cost effectively and the use of high grade material in the pinion can be reduced.

The toothed part is in one embodiment produced by means of a cold forming process and the connection part is formed from a tube. As a result an advantageous selection of material can be carried out in that the toothed part can be formed in accordance with the requirements placed upon it in terms of strength in the toothed area as a part cut from a solid piece of material and possibly hardened while in contrast the connection part can be formed using a less expensive and or lighter material and be formed as a tube which can also achieve a saving of material.

In order to produce the steering pinion a toothed part and a connection part are first provided. The connection part is then connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the toothed part . This rotationally fixed connection is achieved by pressing.

In certain embodiments the protection against pulling apart region is additionally produced in that the connection part undergoes a beading operation in the location of a corresponding depression in the toothed part and material of the connection part accordingly flows into the depression .

In a further advantageous embodiment prior to the pressing of the connection part onto the toothed part the rolling bearing is in addition pushed or pressed onto the bearing seat of the toothed part and only then is the connection part pressed onto the fixing section of the toothed part . In this manner a pre tension is again applied to the rolling bearing in the axial direction in order to fix it securely.

In a toothed part is illustrated in which the fixing section is provided with a knurl . In a toothed part is illustrated in which the fixing section is provided with a roller burnished region . The external diameter of the greatest material elevation of the roller burnished region or the knurl is greater than the internal diameter of the opening of the connection part in the fixing area . When the connection part is pushed onto the fixing section the tips of the material elevations of the roller burnished region or knurl are flattened and dig themselves into the inner surface of the opening of the fixing area of the connection part . A non positive connection is thereby achieved and or a press fit is formed which enables the fixed connection. In an embodiment the widening of the connection part in the fixing area remains below 0.2 mm in order to achieve a durable connection. The connection can thereby be formed in such a durable manner that no additional protection against pulling apart region with a corresponding depression is necessary.

To the extent practicable all individual features described in the individual example embodiments can be combined with each other and or exchanged without departing from the field of the invention.
