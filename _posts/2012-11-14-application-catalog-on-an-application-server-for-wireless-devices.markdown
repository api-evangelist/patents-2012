The present application for patent is a Continuation of patent application Ser. No. 10 187 694 entitled APPLICATION CATALOG ON AN APPLICATION SERVER FOR WIRELESS DEVICES filed Jul. 1 2002 pending and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to wireless networks and computer communications across the wireless networks. More particularly the invention relates to the provision of an application catalog that lists a plurality of applications and data that are served to wireless devices across a wireless network and the application catalog displays available applications and data to the wireless device in an optimal manner.

Wireless devices such as cellular telephones communicate packets including voice and data over a wireless network. In existing wireless networks if the user of the wireless device desires to download and use a software application the user will typically either call a service provider or contact the service provider through another electronic means such as through a separate Internet access and the service provider will either transmit the application to the wireless device across the wireless network or allow the user access a network site with the wireless device through the wireless network where the application is downloadable or accessible.

The applications and data that are downloadable to the wireless device can also have overhead implications that the end user is unaware of such as large size popularity of download or cost to the provider in making a copy available. These factors affecting download are currently accounted for at the service provider side at the time and manner of download. Accordingly it is to the optimization of application and data transfer across a wireless network that the present invention is primarily directed.

The invention is a system method and computer program for providing an application catalog of served applications and data on a wireless network to wireless devices seeking to download the applications and or data. The application catalog is displayable to a wireless device across the wireless network and the application catalog lists at least a plurality of applications and or data downloadable to wireless devices and the application catalog is optimized based upon predetermined criteria such that the preferred application and or data to be downloaded by a wireless device is initially displayed to a wireless device attempting to access the application catalog.

The system for providing an application catalog for served applications on a wireless network particularly includes one or more wireless devices in selective communication with the wireless network where each wireless device having and end user thereof and one or more application download servers in selective communication to the wireless network with each application download server selectively in communication with the one or more wireless devices and selectively downloading applications thereto. The application download server further optimizes the application catalog based upon predetermined criteria such as overhead concerns financial criteria or the like whereby the preferred application to be downloaded by a wireless device is initially displayed to a wireless device attempting to access the application catalog.

The method for providing an application catalog for served applications for wireless devices on a wireless network includes the steps of optimizing an application catalog on an application download server in selective communication to the wireless network the application catalog optimized based upon predetermined criteria such that the preferred application to be downloaded by a wireless device is initially displayed to a wireless device requesting access to the application catalog then contacting the server from a wireless device and requesting from the wireless device the application catalog. Then the method includes the steps of transmitting the optimal application catalog from the application catalog to the wireless device and displaying the optimal application catalog to the end user of the wireless device. The application catalog can be optimized based on one or a number of predetermined criteria such as end user ratings download rates application server overhead marketing advertising costs application download costs to the end user and bandwidth constraints.

The system and method provide an optimal application catalog on an application download server that lists downloadable applications and data to wireless devices that selectively communicate therewith and request the application catalog for viewing. The application catalog is optimizable based upon one or a number of predetermined criteria of the host of the application download server. Furthermore the application catalog can be dynamically optimized in accord with any change in dynamic predetermined criteria such as end user ratings available bandwidth and overhead constraints.

Other objects advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings Detailed Description of the Invention and the Claims.

With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout illustrates one embodiment of the present inventive system for providing an optimized application catalog to one or more wireless devices such as cellular telephone in communication across a wireless network with at least one application download server that selectively downloads software applications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network . As shown here the wireless device can be a cellular telephone with a graphics display a personal digital assistant a pager with a graphics display which is shown here as a two way text pager or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. The system can thus be performed on any form of remote computer module including a wireless communication portal including without limitation wireless modems PCMCIA cards access terminals personal computers access terminals telephones without a display or keypad or any combination or sub combination thereof.

The system for providing an application catalog such as the application catalog shown in for served applications and data to the wireless devices on the wireless network . The term application as used herein is intended to encompass executable and nonexecutable software files raw data aggregated data patches and other code segments. In the system one or more wireless devices that are in selective communication with the wireless network each has and end user thereof that typical controls the communication connection to the wireless network .

One or more application download servers such as application download server shown here on a local server side network or other computer elements in communication with the wireless network such as a stored application database that contains software applications and data that are accessible and downloadable to be executable on the wireless devices . There is also shown a stand alone server a second application download server and in a separate database containing applications and data for the wireless devices . All of the components can work in tandem to provide the application catalog and optimization thereof as is further described herein. However it should be noted that all server side functions can be performed on one server such as application download server . Further any computer or server side computer platform can provide separate services and processes to the wireless devices across the wireless network .

The wireless device such as cellular telephone has a computer platform that can receive and execute software applications transmitted from the application download server . The computer platform includes among other components an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit programmable gate array or other data processing device. The ASIC is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device and is not normally upgradeable. The ASIC or other processor executes an application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform also includes a local database that can hold the software applications not actively used in memory such as the software applications downloaded from the application download server . The local database is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape or soft or hard disk.

Cellular telephones such as cellular telephone themselves are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand held personal digital assistants PDAs . These smart cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor such as ASIC of the cellular device. The wireless device such as cellular telephone can download many types of applications such as games and stock monitors or simply data such as news and sports related data. The downloaded data or executed applications can be immediately displayed on the display or stored in the local database when not in use. The software applications can be treated as a regular software application resident on the wireless device and the user can selectively upload stored resident applications from the local database to memory for execution on the API . The user of the wireless device can also selectively delete a software application from the local database . As a result end users of cellular telephones can customize their telephones with programs such as games printed media stock updates news or any other type of information or program available for download from application download servers through the wireless network .

In developing wireless networks if the end user of the wireless device desires to download and use a software application the end user will attempt to connect to the application download server through bridging a communication connection to the wireless network and attempt to download the desired software application. Once the wireless device contacts the application download server an initial contact is made and the application download server can determines what applications and data are available to that wireless device and send the appropriate information such as a menu or catalog for display on the wireless device so the end user can learn of the available applications.

The conveyance of the menu or catalog however has an associated overhead to the application download server in both size of the application to provide the menu and in the applications that can be downloaded therefrom. Consequently a poorly arranged menu at the end user can necessitate further menu downloads by the user which increases usage of the expensive bandwidth of the wireless network and cost to the end user. The system therefore provides an optimized application catalog menu to the end user to facilitate application and data download across the wireless network .

Another embodiment of the system is illustrated in the block diagram of wherein the component interaction of the wireless device side and the carrier side such as a cellular telecommunications carrier is shown. On the wireless device side the application provisioning client is activated by the end user to access the application download server resident on the carrier side. The user administrator allows the user to control the view of the application catalog once received at the wireless device side and ultimate user applications interacted with at the carrier side . In one embodiment of the user administrator the end user of the wireless device can override the optimal display of the application catalog if so desired. The user administrator can be integrated with the application provisioning client or be a separate object on the wireless device platform .

On the carrier side the carrier applications view manager is on the carrier network and interfaces with the carrier s application download server such as application download server the user applications stored and in execution and other server side components such as databases in the data collection and storage . The carrier applications view manager provides a dynamic view of the application catalog to the wireless devices based upon the input and interaction with the wireless device and local control exercised by the carrier. The carrier administrator allows the carrier to control the carrier applications view manager and thus ultimately control the interaction with the wireless device contacting the carrier side . The data collection and storage is shown as embodied with a database for application user ratings application revenue and application advertisements all of which can form singly in or in tandem the predetermined criteria to optimize the applications catalog .

In regard to performance aspects the predetermined criteria can be based upon the overhead of the server to download the application or the most commonly downloaded applications wherein the most commonly download applications appear first to the end user . And other marketing and advertising concerns can be accounted for at the carrier side to determine application catalog presentation such as if the applications are sold to wireless devices and the predetermined criteria can application sales data wherein the greatest profit making applications for the carrier can be first listed on the application catalog . Other fiscal predetermined criteria can be advertising time sales simple slot list placement purchase or other criteria that inure a benefit to the carrier in arranging the application catalog .

The predetermined criteria can be stored on the same server that serves the applications transmitted to the server such as application download server and that server optimizes the application catalog . Alternately the predetermined data and application catalog can be stored on other server side or networked components such as database and server and the server receives predetermined criteria from another source and then optimizes the application catalog or the server can simply receive an optimized application catalog to provide with the server s particular served applications and data. Any of the functionality as described herein can be shared among several computer devices as would be known in the art.

As is further shown in the application catalog of the end user can be allowed to override the optimal list appearance such as with a next screen button . Other controls can be provided at the wireless device whereby the end user can customize the wireless device to limit the manner of display of the application catalog .

Once the specific application catalog to send to the wireless device has been determined at step the chosen optimal application catalog is transmitted across the wireless network to the wireless device for display thereon as shown at step . After transmission of the application catalog and a determination is made as to whether an application or data is requested as shown at decision . Decision is a generic determination and if some application and data is requested a predefined transmission of the application or data is sent as shown by predefined process . After the predefined process or if there was not a request for applications or data at decision a determination is made as to whether there is any data present to update the predetermined criteria as shown at decision . Examples of the data would be ratings data sent from the wireless device recordation of the specific number of the applications downloaded or recordation of the technical aspects of the download. If there is no data for application catalog optimization at decision then the process returns to wait and receive a request from a wireless device to send an application catalog at step . Otherwise if there is data present to optimize the application catalog at decision then the process returns to step and optimizes the application catalog with the new data.

The flowchart of illustrates the parallel process on the wireless device in communication with the application download server executing the process shown in . The wireless device sends a request to the application download server to receive an application catalog as shown at step and then a determination is made as to whether the requested application catalog was received as shown at decision . If the application catalog was not received at decision then an error is output to the end user of the wireless device as shown at step and the process terminates. Otherwise once the application catalog is received at decision the application catalog preferably sent in optimized form from the application download server displays the application catalog on the display of the wireless device such as display on cellular telephone to the end user as shown at step .

After display of the application catalog in step a determination is made as to whether the end user has requested the application and or data from the application download server as shown at decision . If not decision is reiterated as the process enters a wait state until an action is taken by the end user such as the request of an application or data or specific end user termination of the process. If the end user has requested the download of applications and or data at decision then the wireless device downloads and displays the requested application and or data on the wireless device as shown at step . Once the application and or data has been downloaded and displayed a determination is made as to whether the end user data is present to send to the application download server or other networked device for optimization of the application catalog as shown at decision . An example of such data would be an end user rating of the downloaded application and or data. If there is no data present at decision to send to the application download server or other computer device for application catalog optimization then the process terminates. Otherwise the end user data is sent from the wireless device to the application download server or computer device across the wireless network for application catalog optimization as shown at step and the process on the wireless device then terminates.

The system thus includes a method for providing an application catalog for served applications for wireless devices on a wireless network including the steps of optimizing an application catalog preferably on an application download server in selective communication to the wireless network based upon predetermined criteria such that the preferred application to be downloaded by a wireless device is initially displayed to a wireless device requesting access to the application catalog as shown in . The method further includes the step of contacting the server from a wireless device as shown at step requesting from the wireless device the application catalog as shown at step transmitting the optimal application catalog to the wireless device as shown at step and displaying the optimal application catalog to the end user of the wireless device such as shown at step and in . The method can additionally include the step of overriding the display of the optimal application catalog at the end user such as shown through the change view button in .

The step of optimizing an application catalog based upon predetermined criteria can be optimizing the application catalog based upon one or many criteria including end user ratings sent from the wireless devices . Thus the method would then further include the steps of generating end user ratings for one or more applications from one or more wireless devices and receiving the end user ratings at the application download server or other computer device prior to the step of optimizing the application catalog . The step of optimizing the application catalog can also include optimization based upon at least the specific user of the wireless device attempting to access the application catalog the overhead of the application download server or other computer device to download the application or the most commonly downloaded applications from the application download server or other computer device.

The method can include the step of selling at least one application to the wireless devices and the step of optimizing an application catalog can include optimizing the application catalog based upon at least application sales data. The step of optimizing an application catalog can occur dynamically as the predetermined criteria changes. Moreover the method can further include the steps of determining the predetermined criteria for application catalog optimization at one computer device on the wireless network such as second application download server or stand alone server and transmitting the predetermined criteria to a server optimizing the application catalog resident to the server such as application download server .

In view of the method being executable on the computer platform of a wireless device the present invention includes a program resident in a computer readable medium where the program directs a server or other computer device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method. The computer readable medium can be the memory of the application download server or can be in a connective database such as database . Further the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless device computer platform such as a magnetic disk or tape optical disk hard disk flash memory or other storage media as is known in the art.

In the context of the method may be implemented for example by operating portion s of the wireless network to execute a sequence of machine readable instructions such as wireless platform the application download server and stand alone server . The instructions can reside in various types of signal bearing or data storage primary secondary or tertiary media. The media may comprise for example RAM not shown accessible by or residing within the components of the wireless network . Whether contained in RAM a diskette or other secondary storage media the instructions may be stored on a variety of machine readable data storage media such as DASD storage e.g. a conventional hard drive or a RAID array magnetic tape electronic read only memory e.g. ROM EPROM or EEPROM flash memory cards an optical storage device e.g. CD ROM WORM DVD digital optical tape paper punch cards or other suitable data storage media including digital and analog transmission media.

While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments of the invention it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated.
