The present invention relates to the fields of chemistry and biology and more particularly to the field of insecticides. The present invention includes insecticidal carbamates that are useful for example for the control of insects such as mosquitoes which can be used in applications where exposure to and or contact with humans is likely. The insecticides of the present invention exhibit species selective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and are toxic to mosquitoes but not humans.

Malaria is a global scourge. Over three billion people are at risk of infection by the malaria parasites and which cause an estimated one to two million deaths annually. For many in sub Saharan Africa especially children insecticide treated nets ITNs provide the only means of defense against the mosquito vector of the parasites. Carbamate insecticides work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase AChE and are commonly used to control agricultural pests and disease vectors. Human toxicity resulting from concurrent potent inhibition of human AChE however has thus far discouraged deployment of insecticidal carbamates on ITNs. Currently pyrethroid insecticides have filled this gap. It would thus be desirable to improve current ITN performance by identifying classes of carbamates that possess excellent target selectivity for AChE AgAChE over human AChE hAChE . Such highly selective carbamates would be ideally suited for safe deployment on ITNs but up to the inventors work in this area such compounds have been unavailable. The present inventors have identified certain carbamates that are much more potent at AgAChE than at hAChE. This difference in potency for the two species is unanticipated and potentially very useful.

Of carbamates 3 tert butylphenyl N methyl carbamate carbamate 1a has been studied extensively and is known commercially by the name terbam. Kolbezen et al. reported that 3 tert butylphenyl N methyl carbamate was a 400 nM inhibitor of i.e. housefly AChE MdAChE and that it was significantly toxic to houseflies upon topical administration LD50 mg kg . Kolbezen M. J. Metcalf R. L. Fukuto T. R. Insecticide Structure and Activity Insecticidal Activity of Carbamate Cholinesterase Inhibitors. 1954 2 864 870. Subsequent studies by Kohn showed carbamate 1a to have similar potency at bovine AChE 530 nM . Kohn G. K. Ospenson J. N. Moore J. E. Carbamate Insecticides Some Structural Relationships of a Group of Simple Alkyl Phenyl N Methylcarbamates to Anticholinesterase Activity. 1965 13 232 235. Indeed in his massive review Metcalf noted that the few bovine AChE ICvalues reported at that time matched MdAChE ICvalues well. Metcalf R. L. Structure Activity Relationships for Insecticidal Carbamates. 1971 44 43 78. The present inventors found that the hAChE ICfor carbamate 1a 265 nM is within a factor of 2 of that reported by Kohn for bovine AChE. Thus previous data tended to support that carbamates e.g. 3 tert butylphenyl N methyl carbamate carbamate 1a that are toxic to houseflies are expected to be toxic to bovine and humans.

To the contrary however the present inventors have identified certain carbamates that are much more potent at AgAChE than at MdAChE. This difference in potency for the two insect species is unanticipated and leads to high selectivity for AgAChE relative to hAChE.

The present invention addresses at least some of the needs discussed above by providing carbamate insecticides that can be used in close proximity to humans. In particular the present invention provides phenyl N methyl carbamates that are lethal to insects including mosquitoes. Preferred phenyl N methyl carbamates and compositions of the present invention include compounds that are lethal to insects including mosquitoes but that are not lethal to humans including when applied in appropriate doses.

A DNA sequence encoding the entire wild type AgAChE protein ace1 737 amino acids was synthesized and cloned GenScript Co. Piscataway N.J. . This sequence was derived from the AgAChE sequence in the Ensembl database www.ensembl.org and spanned 18 nucleotides upstream of the start codon to the amino acid codon preceding the stop codon nt 210 to 2438 Accession XM321792 . The encoded amino acid sequence differs from that reported by Weill et al. at two amino acid positions Weill M. Malcolm C. Chandre F. Mogenson K. Berthomieu A. Marquine M. Raymond M. The unique mutation in ace 1 giving high insecticide resistance is easily detectable in mosquito vectors. 2004 13 1 7 . At amino acid positions 35 and 65 there are serines in the Weill et al. Weill 2004 sequence and phenylalanine and alanine respectively in the Ensembl sequence. Expression of recombinant AgAChE utilized the Expression System Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Briefly the AgAChE cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pMTN V5 His in the absence of a stop codon to generate a fusion protein consisting of the AgAChE V5 epitope 6 His tag. Stably transfected S2 cells were selected by cotransfection with the pCoBlast vector in the presence of blastocidin 25 ug ml . S2 cells were routinely grown in Schneider s medium. For preparation of cell lysates stably transfected S2 cells were grown in suspension in spinner flasks and induced with 1 mM copper sulfate. Following 48 hrs of induction at room temperature the cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaHPO pH 8.0 0.5 M NaCl 1 NP 40 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors 1.4 uM pepstatin 0.3 uM aprotinin 1 uM leupeptin 1 mM EDTA . Following a 15 minute incubation at 4 C. with gentle agitation the cell lysate was centrifuged at 3 000 g for 15 minutes. The clear supernatant was collected and used for enzymatic assays. As used in the context of this application this protein is referred to as Ag ace 1S to represent that it is the insecticide susceptible AgAChE enzyme encoded by ace 1.

Inhibition of AChE Ag homogenate Ag ace 1S and hAChE was determined at pH 7.8 using the Ellman assay in a microtiter plate format. Ellman G. L. Courtney K. D. Andres V. J. Featherstone R. M. A new and rapid colorimetric determination of acetylcholinesterase activity. 1961 7 88 95. Enzyme preparations were incubated with inhibitors for 10 minutes prior to addition of DTNB and acetylthiocholine ATCh . The final concentrations of DTNB and ATCh are 0.3 and 0.4 mM respectively. Five inhibitor concentrations run in quadruplicate were used to construct dose response curves Prism 4 for Macintosh .

The total volume in each well of the microtiter plate was 200 uL the enzyme preparation comprised 10 uL in each case. To prepare the Ag homogenate Ag hmg 10 mosquitoes were combined with 1 mL ice cold 0.1 M NaHPObuffer adjusted with 0.1 M NaHPOto pH 7.8 containing 0.1 Triton X 100 in a glass homogenizer. The crude homogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was transferred to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and stored on ice prior to use. Recombinant AgAChE Ag ace 1S described above was obtained in the form of a centrifuged cell lysate and diluted 10 1 with buffer prior to use. Recombinant hAChE lyophilized powder Sigma C1682 with a quoted specific activity of 2790 units mg was diluted to 600 U mL with buffer frozen and stored at 80 C. Immediately prior to assay a frozen hAChE sample was thawed and diluted 1000 fold with buffer before use.

AChE inhibition of seven common commercial carbamate insecticides at three enzyme sources Ag hmg Ag ace 1S and hAChE were examined. As can be seen in Table 1 ICvalues of these seven commercial carbamates are similar at Ag hmg and Ag ace 1S suggesting that Ag ace 1S is the major ATCh hydrolyzing enzyme present in the Ag hmg. AChE inhibition of the following carbamates were examined 

As can be seen selectivity for AgAChE over hAChE inhibition is low with these compounds. The most selective compound is Carbaryl which ranges from 5.5 11 fold selective.

We then prepared a range of 3 substituted phenyl N methylcarbamates 1a 13a conforming to the following general formula 

We assayed compounds having various substituents Rand R in the three enzyme screen. The compounds tested and their corresponding results are provided in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2 Ag hmg ICvalues are quite similar to those obtained with the recombinant Ag ace 1S. provides a plot of log Ag ace 1S IC nM vs log Ag hmg IC nM for all the commercial and synthesized inhibitors described in Tables 1 and 2. The rvalue of 0.937 provides further confirmation that the major ATCh hydrolyzing enzyme in the Ag hmg is ace 1S.

The most striking feature to emerge in Table 2 however is the highly potent and selective AgAChE inhibition obtained with inhibitors 1a 3a. Human Ag ICratios range from 38 to 130 fold based on recombinant Ag ace 1S and 85 to 110 fold based on Ag hmg data. The contact toxicity of these inhibitors was also excellent. In the presence of synergist piperonyl butoxide a one hour exposure to filter paper treated with carbamate 1a at 0.28 ug cmkills 100 of within 24 hours. Similarly one hour exposure to filter paper treated with 2a and 3a at 2.8 ug cmkills 80 and 60 of Ag mosquitoes within 24 hours.

The present inventors have thus identified that the substituent at C3 plays a role in AgAChE potency and selectivity. Interestingly as the size of the 3 alkyl group is decreased from t Bu 1a to i Pr 4a to Et 5a both AgAChE inhibition potency and selectivity decrease significantly. Lower inhibition potency is also seen for 3 phenyl 6a and 3 halo 7a 9a substituted carbamates although the 3 iodo substituted carbamate 9a offers significant selectivity. Keeping the 3 t butyl group constant carbamates 1c 1 h were prepared to assess the effect of the N alkyl group on AChE inhibition potency Table 3 .

As can be seen AgAChE inhibition is sensitive to the nature of the N1 alkyl group. A methyl group 1a gives the highest inhibition potency as has been seen in numerous previous studies of i.e. housefly AChE MdAChE . Kolbezen 1954 and Metcalf 1971. 

As Table 4 illustrates however carbamate 1a is much more potent at Ag hmg AChE 3 nM than at Md homogenate AChE 400 nM . This 100 fold difference in potency for two insect species is unanticipated and leads to the 85 fold selectivity for Ag hmg AChE relative to hAChE noted above in Table 2.

Similarly carbamate 2a 2921 34 8 is reported to be a 700 nM inhibitor at Md hmg AChE. Metcalf I 1965. The 100 fold greater potency of 2a at Ag hmg AChE is again unexpected. A less dramatic but still significant enhancement in potency is seen for carbamate 4a it is 340 nM at MdAChE but 27 nM at AgAChE. Metcalf II 1965. Finally not all the inhibitors in Table 4 are more potent at AgAChE than MdAChE. A dramatic reversal in inhibition potency is seen for 11a tradename butacarb it is 5.318 nM at Ag hmg AChE but 78 nM at Md hmg AChE. Metcalf II 1965. Thus as can be seen neither MdAChE nor bovine AChE ICvalues are predictive of AgAChE ICvalues.

Consequently the high selectivity shown by the present inventors for Ag relative to hAChE seen with inhibitors 1a 3a is unprecedented could not have been predicted and is thus non obvious. The common structural feature these three inhibitors share is the presence of a trialkylmethyl or trialkylsilyl group at the meta position of a phenyl N methylcarbamate.

We then prepared a range of 2 substituted phenyl N methylcarbamates 1b 23b and assayed them in the three enzyme screen Table 5 .

As shown in Table 5 Ag hmg ICvalues are quite similar to those obtained with the recombinant Ag ace 1S. provides a plot of log Ag ace 1S IC vs log Ag hmg ACNE IC for all the compounds in Tables 1 and 5. The rvalue of 0.954 provides further confirmation that the major ATCh hydrolyzing enzyme in the Ag hmg is ace 1S.

The most striking feature to emerge in Table 5 however is the highly potent and selective AgAChE inhibition obtained with carbamates 1b 2b 4b 6b 8b and 13b. Because two sources of AgAChE are used two independent measures of the selectivity are available for most compounds. Human Ag ICratios of these highly selective carbamates range as follows 58 to 77 fold for 8b 74 fold for 6b 32 to 100 fold for 13b to 32 to 131 fold for 4b 1200 fold for 1b and 1 400 9.900 fold for 2b. Full dose response curves for the two most selective inhibitors are shown in . As can be seen in carbamates 1b and 2b achieve 90 inhibition of AgAChE at concentrations where hAChE undergoes no measurable inhibition.

To assess the effect of variation of the N alkyl group on inhibition potency and selectivity 3 analogues of 8b were prepared Table 6 . As can be seen only the N methyl derivative 8b possesses selectivity for AgAChE inhibition.
