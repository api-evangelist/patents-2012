This embodiment relates generally to the field of policy control in automated systems and in particular to an advanced policy control plane for managing the activities and functional operations of policy driven devices and more particularly to a system for regulating wireless device operations in wireless networks.

Wireless service providers are experiencing an exponential growth in wireless data usage. This has left wireless service providers with the sizable task of coping with unprecedented levels of infrastructure strain while simultaneously facing an ever increasing gap between data usage and generated revenue. This ongoing congestion concern has been exacerbated by the growing use of devices such as smartphones data heavy applications and USB dongles which ultimately impact customer quality of service. As a result service providers are now turning to new and innovative solutions for maintaining client service quality while minimizing incurred costs.

One such wireless service provider solution involves bypassing congested and expensive cellular networks by connecting to and streaming data over the growing number of non cellular access points such as WiMAX and WLAN. This process of transferring cellular network connections and data flows to other networks to reduce congestion is known as data offload. Ultimately this requires a connection manager on a device governed by offloading policy to facilitate the transfer of data traffic and network connections between cellular and non cellular networks.

Many data offload and policy enforcement processes rely heavily on knowing the device s location. It is one of the most common measures for determining whether or not a particular policy should be enforced. However existing methods for determining device location have some inherent issues. GPS radios used in devices drain batteries quickly and GPS locations are often inaccurate especially in dense urban areas. Finding device location based on a triangulation process with nearby cellular towers or Wi Fi access point signals are likewise often inaccurate.

Inaccuracies in device location are problematic for data offloading solutions that attempt to make very precise decisions about when and how wireless devices should transition over to Wi Fi networks. Hence this embodiment proposes a novel method of servicing this need without needing to geographically locate the wireless device. Instead the embodiment describes data offloading processes that leverages a notion of location relative to the wireless environment.

In general the term connection management is used to denote the decision process undertaken within each wireless device to determine which of the available physical wireless networks or network access points it will connect to for its network services at any given point in time as well as the subsequent connection enforcement processes. Currently connection management is performed either 

A policy is a set of rules or a course principle of action to guide or govern decisions functionality or operation of a device.

Systems designed to manage the network connections of wireless devices operate based on connection policies. These outline the actions to be taken when certain conditions are met. Many of these systems make use of a policy type that sets a prioritized list of networks for connections. This lets service providers ensure that their access points are always preferred by their clients. It also allows them to set preferred roaming partners. For wireless devices users it provides a mechanism for prioritizing the use of known home or work access points.

Offloading policy must be appropriately enforced by connection managers to ensure that data offload does not interrupt the device s user experience and that their expected quality of service is provided on the new access network. State of the art in offloading presupposes relatively static policies that are structured to manage issues within the context of a specific communications network where the access points to which wireless devices connect to comprise one aspect of this network.

The current state of the art does not comprise the development of advanced offloading profiles based on 

To date offload controllers have been limited in scope and have not fully leveraged the improvements to policy enforcement processes that are achievable through the dynamic analysis of operations data from all related devices and systems. The enhancement of policy enforcement through data aggregation and analysis is a core area of focus of the embodiment. Specifically the area of interconnected wireless networks has been under explored due to the technical complexity and required advanced understanding of how inter device and server cloud collaboration can be leveraged to achieve measurable offload controller improvements through an analytic feedback loop. This feedback loop could be used for example to aggregate offload controller data that may then be processed and returned to the offload controller in the form of profiles which are useful in subsequent policy enforcement decisions. It is clear that offload controllers have not begun to realize their full potential.

Most prior art depicts offload controllers having client side implementations with no server collaboration inter device data exchange or interaction with a policy managing interface such as a policy managing server. Some offload controllers use advanced processes and methods to determine how and when policies are best enforced but these policies do not change dynamically with network device or user conditions.

For endpoint wireless devices making a connection to a network the notion of monitoring collecting and reporting connection data and or attributes for use in analyzing user behavior and device connectivity efficiencies may be considered. However the data collected is not used to modify inform or generate offload controller policy.

Prior art publications generally view profiles as being ostensibly static client based descriptions set by users service providers or OEMs. Some prior art discusses dynamic profile generation however these publications have failed to explore how dynamic profiles may be generated in such a way that they may add value to the algorithmic processes being performed by offload controllers and policy managers. Instead they simply describe collecting data. There is no discussion of then distributing the resulting analytics to provide system improvements to the data collection source entities. ANDSF HotSpot 2.0 GAS ANQP IEEE 802.11u IEEE 802.11v pre loaded Connection Managers and systems without direct connection manager to policy server communication all support policies for setting a prioritized list of networks or access points to connect to. However to date prioritization policies are almost exclusively being used to select a prioritized list of access networks. Most commonly connection managers are also only provided with one or two prioritization levels. One is reserved for the wireless device users owned or trusted access points. The other is for the set of access points owned by the wireless device s wireless service provider. If neither of those options is available the connection manager must rely on direct user input to select appropriate network connections. Despite this standards like ANDSF and IEEE 802.11v currently support over 250 unique priority levels of access networks or access points that can be enforced through connection policy.

In systems where the policy server communicates directly with access points instead of connection managers network prioritization policies are used to restrict access to certain access points in order to force a device onto other access points within the same network. This is largely done for load balancing purposes within a single network. Network prioritization policies in this area are not being used to improve data offloading processes where data offload generally refers to having wireless devices switch between GSM and small cell networks to alleviate congestion events.

Service providers currently rely on network analytics for everything from engineering operations planning to designing targeted marketing campaigns. It is important to note that current network analytics mainly rely on network side measures for analysis they do not capture information from the wireless device itself and hence they produce network side measures. These network side measures are not always reflective of what is actually being experienced by the device. For this reason performance readings measured directly on the device are more reflective of what the user is actually experiencing than readings taken anywhere else. Many issues give rise to the differences between network side and device side readings one of which is wireless signal interference. It is also important to note that current network analytics are not designed specifically for the needs of offloading solutions or the users of offloading solutions.

Existing offload solution control interfaces for service providers or dashboards are quite basic. They allow the service provider to select the policies they would like to push to devices when certain location and network congestion conditions are met. They do not possess any network assessment policy offloading solution assessment or informed policy design functions. Hence these Dashboard interfaces are not overly functional or advanced.

Cellular wireless communication networks include but are not limited to such protocols as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA cellular radiotelephone communication systems Global System for Mobile Communications GSM cellular radiotelephone systems North American Digital Cellular NADC cellular radiotelephone systems Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems Extended TDMA E TDMA cellular radiotelephone systems third generation 3G systems like Wide band CDMA WCDMA and CDMA 2000.

In addition wireless communication devices may also include multiple transceivers that use different communication protocols. Furthermore the transceiver may use other protocols such as wireless local area network WLAN wide area network WAN or local area network LAN protocols such as the Industrial Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 802.16 and 802.18 standards Bluetooth and infrared.

The scope of the present embodiment is not limited by the types the number of or the frequency of the communication protocols that may be used on a wireless communication device.

It will be understood that the embodiment is also applicable to other types of policy driven devices or machine to machine systems.

According to the present invention there is provided a system for regulating wireless device operation in wireless networks comprising one or more profiling servers configured to receive data from one more data sources and comprising one or more processors configured to aggregate and analyze the received data to dynamically generate profiles for distribution by the profiling server s to a plurality of wireless devices and wherein the wireless device operation s are responsive to said profiles and wherein said wireless device s are configured to communicate data relating to said wireless device operations back to the profiling server s .

As used herein wireless device operation refers to the manner in which the device establishes a wireless link with an external entity such as a wireless access point or cellular network for example.

Embodiments of the invention make use of a novel way in which advanced profiles may be dynamically generated and used for the purpose of enhancing overall device performance. In this case performance enhancements are achieved by a process of informing modifying assessing or generating device policies using advanced profiles. In the context of this application the term modify is chosen to refer to policy manipulation providing information to policy generating processes managing policies generating policies or any such process or mechanism that affects policy. These specific processes may be performed by a device or an advanced profiling client working in conjunction with either the managing server depending on the embodiment.

An advanced profile is defined as possibly consisting of but not limited to aggregate summarized statistically analyzed or otherwise processed data as well as detailed descriptions of many of the most important policy enforcement and policy generation logic inputs.

As a simple example related to connection managers an access point profile may be generated by the analytic process of aggregating and averaging the latency and throughput levels being experienced by all participating devices and network probes currently connected to that network.

This embodiment dynamically generates profiles at the server and network level using the composite set of information amalgamated from a plurality of participating components on a plurality of participating networks as well as additional information that cannot be provided by the set of devices device controllers access points policy managers service provider databases or third party data sources.

This embodiment s dynamic profile generation further provides unique ways in which policies may be selectively used and applied. By performing analytical comparisons of profiles at the network level users policies may be differentiated and custom designed for users to be most appropriate for their particular profile or circumstance. For clarity this is the process of comparing profiles in order to dynamically develop differentiated device policies that are selectively applied to users. As an example consider a wireless service provider who would like to use connection managers to offload only the top 20 of data users. This requires centrally amalgamating all user data usage profiles and then comparing them to determine who belongs to the top 20 of data users. Once this set is identified this information may be tied to that set s advanced user profiles and service providers may take advantage of policies that only indicate that only this set should begin to offload data.

This embodiment views profiles as being entities that dynamically evolve as more data is collected therefore they are not static. This embodiment further generates profiles using a server across networks as opposed to the device level so as to incorporate a richer composite set of external information that is not usually available at the device level due to the large data set that would need to be transmitted. Therefore client only advanced profile generation is untenable.

Connection managers and offload solutions require more advanced control interfaces or dashboards than what is currently available. Offload control dashboards currently lack the ability to let users understand the effects of their policies or design improved policies. This embodiment achieves this advancement by merging customized network analytic systems for offload with the control dashboards of offload solutions. The result is an integrated analytics and control dashboard that achieves new capabilities and benefits 

Hence embodiments of the invention go beyond the joint capabilities of normal network analytics systems and offloading solution dashboards. The embodiments are capable of depicting a more accurate view of networks providing an interface for informed policy assessment and providing an interface for information policy design. A dashboard interface provides an interactive tool to those implementing this embodiment that further improves control policy generation distribution and achieved operational results. The dashboard accomplishes this by accepting and dynamically incorporating advanced system inputs from the managing entity. These advanced inputs provided via the dashboard allow for the simple customization and improvement of policy driven systems. The advanced inputs may be for example the desired results of policy enforcement the importance weightings of various policy enforcement factors or even system performance thresholds. This is uniquely different than explicitly setting profiles via a dashboard. The dashboard and associated components may use these inputs to design profile sets such that policies are capable of most effectively producing the desired customized results and operational behaviors. For clarity as per the above connection manager example if an advanced input is received via the dashboard to offload only the top 20 of bandwidth consumers only those devices will have the associated advanced profile required to enforce this particular offload policy. With respect to this trait user profiles have not been explicitly set by service providers. This is a dynamically changing set of users only identified through an analytic and comparative process. A human interactive dashboard is but one example of an interface that may be provided to the embodiment. Other examples of dashboards would be various forms of interfaces some of which may communicate with services as opposed to human users.

It is envisaged that the profiling clients in accordance with the embodiments of the invention may be associated or bundled with offload controllers or connection managers in wireless networks.

Aspects of the invention are only discussed by way of example relative to data offload solutions however the concepts may be more broadly applied.

The invention may be used to modify offloading policies in order to improve the efficiency with which offloading solutions meet the desired performance results of wireless service providers. The existing structure of prioritization policies can be leveraged to perform new high value processes in the realms of load balancing and data offload. Although currently being used to prioritize specific networks they can with modification be used to prioritize the selection of the best access points within these networks. In this way users are most likely to receive the highest quality of service QoS available from their set of connection options.

Where Level 1 represents the highest grade access points for quality of service and N represents the Nth highest grade. In the previous example network selection preferences which are often set by complex business agreements by wireless service providers are never violated and yet the resulting QoS for users is improved. However in some cases it may be appropriate to modify the order of selected networks to further improve the resulting QoS for users.

The embodiment processes data from any subset of wireless devices access points network management systems third party data sources and crowd sourcing applications to modify network prioritization policies to include the prioritization of access points within networks. This will result in improved QoS for wireless device users and overall improved results obtained through data offload solutions. These modified lists are compatible with all methods of data offload and load balancing including but not limited to ANDSF HotSpot2.0 GAS ANQP IEEE 802.11u IEEE 802.11v or Wi Fi Certified Passpoint pre loaded connection managers and systems without a direct connection manager and policy server communication. In the case of systems with direct connection manager and policy communication lower priority access points would be made unavailable to wireless devices to force them onto the highest priority access points.

IEEE 802.11 will need to support data offloading processes by providing devices before they connect with a sense of what quality of service they would receive by connecting to a particular access point or network. This may take the form of a broadcasted message or a QoS estimate response to a wireless device wireless environment scan. This embodiment will refer to both these scenarios as broadcasts.

Broadcasts which indicate connection QoS may take the form of direct measures throughput latency jitter packet loss etc. an encoding or class for these direct measures or a new class value that combines several QoS metrics throughput latency jitter packet loss etc. into one class value that indicates an aggregate notion of QoS.

Hence analytic processes will be required to determine how to best combine several measures into one class value that is representative of QoS. Further analytic processes will be required to determine a system for mapping how downlink IP traffic classes can be best translated into over the air 802.11 traffic estimations. This mapping is likely to be service provider specific and may need to be transferred to the device for use. This mapping will allow devices to interpret the broadcasts and estimate what their likely IP traffic quality would be after a connection is established.

Offload controllers and connection managers use methods to generate deploy and selectively enforce offloading policy. The embodiment covers the dynamic generation of advanced profiles of the input entities. The advanced profiles as they are dynamically created and updated would then be made available to the policy generation policy deployment and connection enforcement methods so as to autonomously improve network performance. This profile generation process is most appropriately performed by a server computing cluster or cloud infrastructure that amalgamates all available information from devices connection managers offload controllers access points service provider databases and external entities so as to dynamically generate useful and detailed profiles to be fed back for use in the policy methods.

Modification of device controller policy refers to policy manipulation providing information to policy generating processes managing policies generating policies or any such process or mechanism that affects policy. This embodiment intends to assess guide or otherwise inform the creation modification or restructuring of device polices.

In another aspect the invention provides a method for regulating wireless device operations in wireless networks comprising a plurality of wireless devices whose operation is responsive to policies a plurality of profiling clients on said devices whose operation is responsive profiles one or more profiling servers in communication with said devices which generates profiles and one or more policy managers in communication with said devices which contains a store of policies the method comprising the profiling servers accepting data from more than one data source the profiling servers analyzing the accepted data to generate profiles the profiling servers communicating profiles to devices and profiling clients policy managers communicating policies to devices and profiling clients profiling clients creating and or modifying policies by as governed by the profiles using said policies to govern wireless device operation and communicating the performance of the profiles policies and device operation as data to the profiling servers whereby the data communication processes are likewise governed by said profiles a method for modifying device controller policy in a network comprising a plurality of communicating devices whose operation is controlled by a device controller policy the method comprising accepting data from at least one data source generating profiles by analyzing the accepted data using the profiles to update the device controller policy by sending data to the communicating devices and communicating the performance of the profiles the device controller policy and or the device.

In a further aspect the invention provides a profiling server for distributing profiles to profiling clients to govern the operation of devices and or device controllers within a system containing multiple devices comprising an input for receiving a set of data from multiple data sources one or more processors configured to aggregate and analyze the data to dynamically generate a set of profiles and one or more profiling managers for distributing the set of profiles to remote profiling clients.

The embodiment described can denote the development of the processes algorithms and mechanisms required to develop advanced offloading profiles to support improved offload decision processes where these advanced offloading profiles comprises the extension of the state of the art in offloading to comprise 1 5 above. In this case the device is a wireless communication device such as a mobile smartphone laptop or dongle. The device controller functions as the connection manager to enforce data offload. An offload controller in the wireless service provider s network provides the role of the policy manager . Advanced profiles supplied by the advanced profiling server may be used to modify connection priorities and the behavior of connection managers device controller in order to improve all subsequent connection decisions. Alternatively these advanced profiles may simply provide a source of additional information to connection managers device controller and offload controllers policy manager that may be referenced when appropriate. In this embodiment the loop between the advanced profiling server the advanced profiling client the advanced profiling dashboard the offload controller policy manager the connection manger device controller and the device operating system ensure that connection decisions are continuously improving. The connection manager device controller consumes policy information from an offload controller policy manager and when appropriate will cooperate with an advanced profiling client to implement a seamless transition of data flow onto an alternative wireless communication network dependent on the advanced profiles generated by the advanced profiling server . Depending on the supported wireless communication device hardware networks available for offload may include but are not limited to various grades of cellular wireless communication networks WiMAX WLAN femtocell and picocell access networks. It is important that all offloaded data flows maintain or improve user quality of service and provide an uninterrupted experience while accomplishing service provider user management goals. The connection manager device controller will make all connection decisions through a collaborative process among the device advanced profiling client the advanced profiling server and the offload controller policy manager .

Raw data collected and stored in data logs by the advanced policy client is received in the data receiver of the advanced profiling server through the logs API 1 .

The relationship environmental correlations produced by the relationship and environmental profile engine are stored along with the advanced profiles in the profiles database . An example of a relationship profile may be devices tend to exhibit behavior A when interacting with system B but only when near locations similar to C. This relationship profile is formulated from the correlation of three separate independent profiles.

In addition the relationship and environmental profile engine provides analytics and aggregate data to the Advanced Profiling Dashboard through the dashboard API 2 . The advanced profiling dashboard is the user interface for the system and may alternatively be implemented via a cloud based structure or any other form of user interface. The advanced profiling dashboard includes a dashboard user interface see and a dashboard database . The advanced profiling dashboard receives advanced profiles from the relationship and environmental profile engine through the dashboard API 2 to the advanced profiling server . The dashboard user interface communicates the analytics to users and in turn user inputs and interactions are communicated to the profiling manager through the dashboard API 2 . User inputs can include but are not limited to performance thresholds and profile weightings to fine tune the needs and or demands of the device wireless service providers. The advanced profiling dashboard is unique in that users may set thresholds weightings and desired policy enforcement results. The said inputs are then used by the profiling manager to create customized policies that are selectively distributed to device controllers based on the comparative profiles to most effectively meet performance objectives. The dashboard database stores user preferences and the like that are received from the user inputs.

In the preferred embodiment the profiling manager extracts user inputs and interactions from advanced profiling dashboard and integrates these inputs with the output from the relationship and environmental profile engine and the profiles database . The profiling manager then uses this composite set of information and instructions to direct and manage the distribution of the advanced profiles using the data sender to advanced profiling clients through the profiles API 1 . In the absence of an advanced profiling client this information may alternatively be directly distributed to device controllers device operating systems and policy managers as well as third party data sources .

The policy database contains the data related to policies providing the rules for operating the device in a particular manner. The policies include but are not limited to access point lists locations applications subscribers time tiers service levels devices and the like. Policy managers are potentially covered under prior art.

Advanced profiles are transmitted from the profiling manager within the advanced profiling server to the profiling server interface through the API 1 . Advanced profiles relevant to that specific device are stored in the profiles database . Advanced profiles stored in the profile database may be called depending on the localized conditions of the device and the functionality of the device operating system .

The profiling server interface communicates and distributes advanced profiles to but not limited to the device controller policy manager and device software applications . The advanced profiles issued to the device controller from the profiling server interface control the functionality of the device and the device operating system . Similarly the advanced profiles issued to the device software applications from the profiling server interface control the functionality of the device software applications . The profiling server interface distributes advanced profiles through a policy manager interface to the profiling client interface to assess guide or otherwise inform the creation modification or restructuring of policies and then to the policy manager . The policy manager interface communicates to the policy manager through the policy manager API 5 .

The policy manager interface receives policies from the policy manager then either leaves policies in their original state or modifies them using information found in the advanced profiles . The set of original policies the set of modified policies or some combination thereof is then passed to the Device directly through the device interface or indirectly through the Policy Manager . Modified policies are modified for the purpose of improving Device Controller and Device performance.

The device controller is the component primarily responsible for consuming advanced profiles from the advanced profiling client modified policies and policies from the policy manager to enforce desired functionality of the device operating system .

The device is the system in which a particular set of functions or operations are to be controlled using a set of rules comprised of although not limited to policies profiles and user inputs. Externally supplied policies may be in the form of a command message which in this case is a policy that is not conditionally enforced. Alternatively the device may simply send command messages to various interconnected systems. The types the number the applications the functionality the operation or the hardware resources of the device do not limit the scope of this embodiment. The device may comprise of but is not limited to a device operating system hardware resources and software applications . The device operating system is a software package that manages the device hardware resources and provides the services necessary to execute application software on the device. Devices and the device operating systems are known to persons skilled in the art.

In summary the device controller is the only piece that enforces policies to perform device actions. The advanced profiling server is the only piece that generates advanced profiles . Advanced profiles are generally passed to the advanced profiling client . The advanced profiling client can exist attached to the policy manager the device wireless device access point or other or the advanced profiling server or can be stand alone. The advanced profiling client can use the advanced profiles to modify policies directly or it can pass advanced profiles to the policy manager or device components and allow them to modify the policies . For the advanced profiling client to modify policies the policy manager or policy store on the device would need to pass policies to the advanced profiling client . The modified policies would then be passed to the device controller for use. If the advanced profiling client is not modifying policies directly and is instead supplying advanced profiles to the policy manager or device then it will be their responsibility to pass any modified policies to the device controller .

One example application and embodiment of a device component is the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies. The advanced profiling client may be used to either provide additional information to assess guide or otherwise inform the creation modification or restructuring of device offload polices and or the connection logic algorithm used by the connection manager device controller to offload mobile data to alternative access networks.

Additionally the advanced profiling client is used to report data logs to the advanced profiling server . The advanced profiling client in return receives the set of advanced profiles that are used as the discussed inputs into the connection logic method. In the connection manager system application a loop between the advanced profiling client on the device and the advanced profiling server will provide for the ongoing improvement of policies and user experience. Data collected by the profiling data collection component and reported to the advanced profiling server through data logs includes although is not limited to the following the observed access point basic service set identification BSSID the service set identifier SSID of the network connected to the access point the received signal strength indication RSSI of the access point the network throughput the network latency the access point authentication the access point key management the access point encryption schemes the frequency of the channel over which the client is communicating with the access point location device information application information application data flow to the various access point user data patterns time stamps and the like.

The mobile connection manager system application in the preferred embodiment utilizes a connection manager as the device controller . The connection manger device controller is a software package that may be held on the device that is used to enforce access point connections and provide authentication credentials when applicable. The majority of these systems are static and do not communicate with a network server.

The embodiment demonstrates an advanced implementation of the connection manager system. In this embodiment the connection manger device controller may receive its list of prioritized access points for offloading data from the offload controller policy manager and or alternatively the advanced profiling client . The mechanisms for scanning connecting and authenticating to alternative access points may be performed by the connection manger device controller on the device . Scanning may alternatively be performed by the advanced profiling client to retrieve available local device data.

The offload controller policy manager is a server software package that often ties into the service provider s subscription database to provide the advanced profiling client or connection manager device controller with a prioritized list of access points via a transmission protocol. This prioritized list of access points is initiated by the wireless service provider to suit their cellular network and business requirements. The offload controller policy manager provides wireless service providers with the offload policy control they require to manage the explosion in data growth. In the mobile connection manager system application of the preferred embodiment the advanced profiling client may have a variety of implementations depending on the degree of integration with the connection manger device controller on the device . Six possible implementations are disclosed although this does not present an exhaustive list of possible implementations of the advanced profiling client .

The first is a full integration of the profiling client and the device controller and is a collaborative data collection. In this implementation the advanced profiling client uses a method informed by the advanced profiling server and the offload controller policy manager to enforce improved connection decisions by modifying the information received by the connection manger device controller . Further the advanced profiling client is capable of recording and reporting all data retrieved by the connection manger device controller via user inputs scans message transmissions and the like.

In a non collaborative data collection implementation the advanced profiling client uses a method informed by the advanced profiling server and the offload controller policy manager to enforce improved connection decisions by modifying the information received by the connection manger device controller . However the advanced profiling client is not capable of recording and reporting data retrieved by the connection manger device controller and thus the advanced profiling client must itself retrieve all reported data via user inputs scans recorded message transmissions and the like.

The third is a semi integrated collaborative data collection implementation. The advanced profiling client is semi integrated with a connection manger device controller . The advanced profiling client simply provides the connection manger device controller with an improved set of information that the connection manger device controller may then choose to use in its management processes. Further the advanced profiling client is capable of recording and reporting all data retrieved by the connection manger device controller via user inputs scans message transmissions and the like. The advanced profiling client acts as a simple API API 1 to the advanced profiling server to allow the connection manger device controller to communicate in order to send and or receive information data profiles and the like.

In a semi integrated non collaborative data collection implementation the advanced profiling client simply provides the connection manger device controller with an improved set of information that the connection manger device controller may then use in its management processes. However the advanced profiling client is not capable of recording and reporting data retrieved by the connection manger device controller and thus the advanced profiling client must retrieve all reported data via user inputs scans recorded message transmissions and the like.

In a fifth implementation there is no integration with the device controller and there is an advanced profiling client present. The advanced profiling client simply acts as a data reporting tool to the advanced profiling server . Information is not fed back to the advanced profiling client to provide improved data for the connection manger device controller .

In the sixth implementation there is no integration and no advanced profiling client . The Advanced Profiling Server is acting as a stand alone system. Systems such as a connection manger device controller may simply choose to send data to the advanced profiling server based on some pre arranged agreement.

Alternatively these user inputs may provide new information such as new policies access networks metrics or desired system performance results. The user input and policy modification interface processes any newly acquired information from the user and performs the appropriate actions. If the user has inputted information that affects profile interfaces then the user input and policy modification interface would interact with the advanced profiling server to adjust these profiles. If the user has inputted new polices new policy modifications or new desired system performance results the user input and policy modification interface would communicate through the advanced profiling server with the advanced profiling client and profiling server interface to instruct on how to modify or update polices to meet the system user s needs.

Examples will be given from the perspective of offloading solutions. This type of network analytics is different than other forms because offload solution network analytics place an emphasis on providing useful information to offloading solutions and the users of offloading solutions. Further the data used for this specific type of network analysis would typically come from the offloading solution itself. This may be device view data supplied by connection managers device controllers or advanced profiling clients . It may also leverage information supplied by policy managers which may be working in conjunction with offload solution protocols such as those in ANDSF HotSpot 2.0 GAS ANQP IEEE 802.11u IEEE 802.11v other IEEE 802.11 standards pre loaded connection managers or systems without a direct connection manager to policy server communication.

As an example consider a connection manager device controller or advanced profiling client which measures user experienced quality of service on a particular network. This information may be combined with any network viewed quality of service measures captured by the policy manager working with a data offload solution or measures received from third party data sources . The advanced profiling server would then generate access point profiles to be displayed over the access point profile interface . The system user can then assess the quality of the access point from the perspective of the offloading solution. Displayed information may include how the user experiences the access point when offloaded to it how the user s presence on that access point affects overall network performance and capacity or how the access point should best be used upgraded or maintained for offloading purposes. This information set and its purpose is much different than standard network analytics.

Embodiments address the need of wireless service providers to have more visibility over the effects of offloading solutions and specific policies. Hence the advanced profiling dashboard displays analytics which assess offloading solutions and offloading policies from the policy manager and modified policies from the advanced profiling client . Devices third party data sources and policy managers and or advanced profiling clients record device performance results relative to the policies and being enforced. This allows the advanced profiling server to build advanced profiles that assess the performance of these specific policies. The policy assessments are then displayed to the user over the advanced profiling dashboard user interface.

As an example consider a set of connection managers device controllers that are using a policy stating that they should connect to access network X after 5 pm if possible. The intention of this policy is to alleviate congestion on the home network of those devices that is consistently getting bogged down at 5 pm. It may happen then that so many devices connect to access network X at 5 pm that access network X becomes more congested than the wireless service provider s home network. In this case the devices that have been switched onto this alternative network will receive a worse network connection than they otherwise would have. In this scenario which is likely to upset users the performance results of access network X and the policy being used would be reported to the advanced profiling server . Access point profiles would then be generated and displayed to the wireless service provider over the advanced profiling dashboard user interface depicting this policy issue. The wireless service provider can then see that their policy is not working well and in response input policy changes to rectify the problem. As an example the newly modified access point policy may dictate that only 50 of available users should connect to access network X at 5 pm.

Embodiments address wireless service providers need for more network information while designing appropriate offloading policies . Currently network analytics are not tied into offloading solutions which makes it impossible to perform appropriate what if analysis on policies that wireless service providers are considering deploying. The embodiment allows for a what if analysis and makes suggestions to the wireless service provider as to how they should design their offloading policies. This aspect of the embodiment is a policy design and testing interface.

As an example consider a wireless service provider who is trying to offload more of their network s data flow at 5 pm to alleviate congestion. There may be dozens of access networks that they could choose to move users to as a first priority. Setting this policy is an important decision for wireless service providers since all devices that are trying to offload their data will look for this network first. Hence it is likely that many users will use the first priority network. Despite the importance of appropriately setting this policy the wireless service provider has no way of knowing which alternative network is the best choice. Using the enclosed embodiment the wireless service provider could assess access point profiles and connection profiles relative to the available network options over the advanced profiling dashboard . The user input and policy modification interface can then be used to perform a what if analysis and suggest to the user which alternative network is likely the best choice as a top priority roaming option. This particular network option may be chosen for example because it has been delivering the best quality of service to users has the most capacity to accept more data or because other policies that use of this particular network are performing well.

The following are examples of how the advanced profiling server uses information to create advanced profiles and how the system uses them to perform specific tasks. In all cases once the data is collected and reported to the advanced profiling server analytic and statistical processes performed on the data logs allows the development of advanced sets of profiles to be used by the advanced profiling client and distributed to policy managers device operating systems and device controllers to assess guide or otherwise inform the creation modification or restructuring of device polices. At any time local offline profiles may also be stored by the advanced profiling client in the profiles database .

In the first example the advanced profiling server performs the generation of dynamic user profiles . User and operational behaviors may be extracted by the advanced profiling client for reporting via data logs to the advanced profiling server . Alternatively this same information may be extracted from processes performed by the device controller for reporting to the advanced profiling server . Additional information related to these profiles may be received from but are not limited to policy manager servers managing the device controller third party data sources and user inputs .

One specific application of how user profiles may be used in a unique and useful way in the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies based on the 60 10 Rule is outlined below. The 60 10 Rule is that the top 10 of mobile data users account for 60 of global data usage Cisco 2010 .

Given that inferior connection decisions are an inevitable consequence of using a connection manger device controller the risk of inferior connection decisions is of key concern to wireless service providers. This risk may be mitigated by using user profiles which dynamically identify the largest bandwidth consumers. By amalgamating comparing and profiling user data usage in semi real time connection mangers device controller may take advantage of the power law distribution of bandwidth consumption. In this way users may be prioritized for offload based on their current impact on the network and less users total are required for offloading to achieve desired results. Additionally the top X of bandwidth consumers that are selected as prioritized offload candidates may be set by wireless service providers or dynamically driven by semi real time network congestion conditions.

For simplicity consider two users experiencing network congestion one is a heavy bandwidth consumer the other is not. Without dynamically profiling these particular users both will become offload candidates and therefore they are both at risk of connecting to an inferior network. If however these users are profiled only the heavy bandwidth consumer will be initially offloaded. This reduction in consumption itself may be sufficient to allow the small bandwidth consumer to begin experiencing their required improvement to quality of service. In the event that focused offloading of the heavy bandwidth users cannot rectify network congestion and performance all users will become offload candidates. For example if poor quality of service is being created by malfunctioning or damaged cellular infrastructure then offloading a subset of the users may not solve the problem and all candidates will need to be offloaded to rectify the poor service quality.

A second example is the generation of dynamic location profiles performed by the advanced profiling server . The device controller may benefit from location profiles created from data including but not limited to location location specific device controller performance measures signal strengths network topologies network characteristics the quality of decisions made by device controller and the general wireless network environment. This data may be extracted by the advanced profiling client for reporting to the advanced profiling server via logs . Alternatively the advanced profiling server may receive this same information extracted from for example a device controller third party data sources and user inputs . Additional location and topology information may be extracted from databases held by for example wireless service providers or other map databases at the discretion of the wireless service provider.

One specific example of how location profiles may be used in a unique and useful way in the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies is outlined below.

The repeated establishing and breaking of network connections that occurs if an appropriate connection cannot be maintained for a reasonable amount of time is called network ping pong. This often occurs as a result of devices moving in and out of range of adequate signal strengths. The system improves connection decisions over time by systematically characterizing locations based on the quality of connection decisions made by connection manager device controller while in these areas. Consider an office building with many Wi Fi hotspots. Due to the nature of these locations clients are often in range of the access points for long enough to avoid experiencing network ping pong. Over time connection managers device controllers are likely to report a tendency for connection decisions to Wi Fi access points in this area to be of high quality. This location would then be labeled as appropriate for data offloading to improve the information available to advanced profiling client connection manager device controller offload controller policy manager and or the advanced profiling server . Connections with an equal or greater quality of service in comparison to alternative offload access points that are maintained for a period of time are labeled as high quality or high value connections.

Now consider an urban location that has historically produced unpredictable wireless signal strengths. In this zone wireless signal strengths are sensitive to movement user location and wireless device orientation. Network ping pong in urban locations is common because connection decisions tended to be of low quality. As a result this area would be labeled as being an inappropriate region for data offloading.

The third example is the generation of dynamic access point profiles performed by the advanced profiling server . Location historical average performance historical average throughput measures historical average latency measures estimated range and general characteristics are all extracted and reported to the advanced profiling server via data logs . All of the data is then labeled relative to the device taking the reading access point technology network details time of day usage behaviors subscription profile and location and the like to provide context. This information may be extracted by the advanced profiling client for reporting to the advanced profiling server . Alternatively the advanced profiling server may receive this same information from device controllers . Wireless service providers users and third party data sources at the discretion of the wireless service provider may provide additional network information.

Access point profiles are utilized to classify the plurality of access points detected by the advanced profiling clients device operating systems and or device controllers . Access point profiles are constructed from an aggregate of data. This data comprises of but is not limited to 

One specific example of how access point profiles may be used in a unique and useful way in the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies is outlined below.

A successful connection in the preferred embodiment is one that is maintained for a reasonable amount of time with equal or better quality of service in comparison to alternative offload access points. A failed connection is one that does not meet one of the said conditions.

The logging of past successes failures with respect to connection attempts is an essential component for characterizing specific access points provided that the context of the success failure is also recorded. By analyzing the success failures of connection attempts with respect to time of day running applications mobility location device or other available measures a comprehensive profile of the access point can be constructed. For example if connections generally fail while throughput intensive applications are running the system can extrapolate that the access point and in particular the access network at that particular time cannot handle heavy throughput. If connections generally fail during a specific time of day it can extrapolate that during this time of day congestion is particularly high on the said access network. For example if connections generally fail when Android devices attempt to connect to the access network the said devices may not be compatible with the access point.

The analysis and statistical processing of past successful and failed connections with respect to the associated context and characteristics of the device at that particular time provides one piece of the overall access point profiles which may be used to improve connection decisions. The analytics are also of key interest to wireless service providers and network managers seeking to optimize the access networks. Currently some connection managers device controllers provide the logging of successful and failed connections as an offline capability with minimal or no context provided. Using an advanced profiling server connection managers device controllers are able to share this information with other devices and networks to improve overall performance through the advanced profiling client .

In the fourth example device controllers often operate on systems with running applications that must be managed by the device controller to ensure effective operation. The generation of dynamic application profiles is performed by the advanced profiling server . Technical device requirements network requirements normal user behaviors and the like are extracted and recorded in data logs while the application is in use by the device . This information may be extracted by the advanced profiling client for reporting to the advanced profiling server . Alternatively the advanced profiling server may receive the said information from device controllers third party data sources user inputs wireless service provider database or application developers at their discretion.

One specific example of how application profiles may be used in a unique and useful way in the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies is outlined below.

The majority of current connection manager device controller policies related to application offloading simply direct data traffic over specific access technologies and protocols. An example may be a policy to send YouTube data over Wi Fi whenever possible. This policy does not incorporate an important aspect of network performance and the more specific requirements to effectively run applications on wireless devices .

Applications have different priorities in terms of for example network latency and network throughput requirements to provide a positive user experience other examples are jitter and packet loss . By characterizing applications based on these requirements applications may be offloaded to the access networks that most accurately meet the said requirements of a positive user experience. Currently supported application policies are expanded upon in combination with access point profiles to provide an improvement to user experience during offload events.

With the co operation of application developers application profiles may be taken further. Applications may be profiled based on what dynamic graphical resolution reductions may be performed in response to experiencing slow network speeds to maintain a certain level of user experience.

In the fifth example the generation of dynamic device profiles is performed by the advanced profiling server . Technical specifications technical capabilities performance measures supported networks supported access technologies manufacturer model number operating system details installed applications performance measures and the like are extracted and recorded in data logs . This information may be extracted by the advanced profiling client for reporting to the advanced profiling server . Alternatively the advanced profiling server may receive the said information from device controllers third party data sources user inputs wireless service provider database and the like. One specific example of how device profiles may be used in a unique and useful way in the implementation of a mobile connection manger system to enforce data offload policies is outlined below.

Wireless service providers have incentive to use device profiles to better understand the implications that various devices have on the wireless networks. These detailed profiles allow wireless service providers to compare the network consumption rates associated with each device. They also allow wireless service providers to better understand which devices are receiving the best service and are most compatible with the network infrastructure. This information may be used by wireless service providers to motivate device deployment strategies aimed at convincing consumers to use the specific devices preferred by the wireless service provider.

In the sixth example effective load balancing requires semi real time performance measurements of all networks available for sharing the load as well as detailed user location device and or application profiles. By understanding the state of available networks certain networks may be prioritized for congestion reduction and others for congestion on loading. An understanding of users is required to predict behaviors and mobility vectors as to not offload users to networks with which the user will experience a short lived connection or connection to an inferior network. An understanding of location provides an understanding of which areas within the space undergoing load balancing should be prioritized for offload. Furthermore an understanding of devices and the applications running on the device operating system ensures that the process of load balancing connects users to the most appropriate network for maintaining expected user experience. Load balancing dynamically and in response to semi real time conditions requires advanced relationship profiles amongst all of the interconnected factors that participate in the load balancing. Executing a load balancing strategy that simply searches for the best fit with respect to any one of these factors by itself is a flawed model. Therefore relationships profiles must be built and contributed to policy enforcement logic to allow the trade offs between all factors to be considered in order to provide the best overall user experience while adequately distributing the load.

The load balancing approach is unique in that it leverages collaboration between a policy manager a dynamic advanced profiling server and all available devices . The network offload controller policy manager provides long standing policies which govern the list of prioritized access points provided to connection managers device controllers and the advanced profiling client . Then semi real time network state user behavior location device running application and the like are provided by the plurality of devices . The accumulation of this information from the said collection of sources may then be used by the system to most appropriately offload devices in order to balance the load across the network.

Prior art in connection management largely considers load balancing to be a non real time process. In this model the offload controller policy manager may make occasional modifications to the list of prioritized networks in order to avoid having all users attempt to connect to the same access network as a first priority. However this policy is static. After the policy is delivered to the device the policy is strictly enforced until encountering an update event. Its enforcement is not subject to the states of dynamic variables. Static policies are ineffective at providing a means of load balancing in semi real time.

Specific examples referring to are now given. The advanced profiling client may or may not be integrated directly into the device . If it is not then the device device controller or an application must perform quality of service tests. If the advanced profiling client is integrated into the device then the advanced profiling client may provide these functions. The method of delivery and use of policies is case dependant and may include the methods defined by ANDSF HotSpot2.0 GAS ANQP IEEE 802.11u IEEE 802.11v as well as other IEEE 802.11 standards pre loaded connection managers or systems where there is no direct communication between policy manager and connection manager device controller .

The first example of access point measurements is given. Devices which may be wireless devices or network access points routinely perform latency throughput and other connection tests to evaluate the standard of connection quality. Information shown in the list below which includes but is not limited to the access point data is passed to the advanced profiling server where it is processed in combination with any third party data sources to form access point profiles . The advanced profiling client then uses the access point profiles to modify access point priority list policies from the policy manager in such a way that improves their performance as part of a data offload solution. These modified policies are then passed to the device by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. Access points showing superior performance are moved up in the prioritized list. Likewise access points showing inferior performance are moved down. It this way devices using policies modified by the policy manager interface will establish connections that deliver an improved quality of service to device users. Modified access point lists are passed to devices by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use.

The second example is for fault tracking and analysis. Devices which may be wireless devices or network access points routinely track and log past successful and unsuccessful connection attempts or errors. This information is passed to the advanced profiling server where it is processed in combination with any third party data sources to form connection profiles . The advanced profiling client then uses the connection profiles to modify network prioritization policies from the policy manager in such a way that improves their performance as part of a data offload solution. These modified policies are then passed to the device by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. Access points showing superior performance with fewer errors are moved up in the prioritized list. Likewise access points showing inferior performance with more errors are moved down. In this way devices using these modified policies will attempt to establish connections known to provide improved reliability to device users. More connection attempts would be successful in this case. Modified access point lists are passed to devices by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use.

In a third example of location based offload evaluation devices routinely track and log past successful and unsuccessful connection attempts errors and connection durations. This information is passed to the advanced profiling server where it is processed in combination with any third party data sources form location profiles . The advanced profiling client then uses the location profiles to modify policies from the policy manager in such a way that improves their performance as part of a data offload solution. These modified policies are then passed to the device by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. Access points in regions known to provide more reliable service are moved up in the prioritized list. Likewise access points in regions that know to be less reliable with more disconnections and shorter connection durations are moved down. It this way devices using these modified policies will attempt to establish connections in regions known to provide improved reliability to device users. More connection attempts total would be successful in this case.

In a fourth example of application based offload evaluation devices routinely track the performance of applications and application specific network requirements for a positive user experience. This information which includes but is not limited to the data shown in the list below is passed to the Advanced Profiling Server where it is processed in combination with any third party data sources to form application profiles . The advanced profiling client then uses the application profiles to modify access point list policies from the policy manager in such a way that improves their performance as part of a data offload solution. These modified policies are then passed to the Device by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. When a device is looking for a network to use access points that are most appropriate for the running application on device are moved up in the prioritized list. Likewise access points known to provide worse service to the running application are moved down the list. In some cases the re prioritization of access points will be based on what applications the device normally uses and not what application the device is using at the given point in time. In this way devices using these modified policies will attempt to establish connections known to provide improved service quality for those applications normally used by the device user. Modified access point policy lists are passed to devices by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. In some embodiments multiple prioritized lists will be sent to devices device controllers or advanced profiling clients. Each prioritized list will be relevant to certain types of applications. When a device wants to connect to an access point the chosen list to use will depend on currently running applications.

In a fifth example user specific offloading policy devices routinely track user specific information including their behavioural trends and individual network requirements for a positive user experience. This information is passed to the advanced profiling server where it is processed in combination with any third party data sources and user subscription information to form user profiles . The advanced profiling client then uses the user profiles to customize policies from the policy manager for specific users in such a way that improves their experienced service quality when offloaded. Further users in this example may purchase subscription packages that would influence the policies that they receive. These modified policies are passed to the device by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. As an example consider a user who has purchased a premium data offload package. In this case the advanced profiling client may be used to modify the access point list policy of that specific user in such a way that provides them with improved service quality over non premium users. Highest quality access points would be ranked high in the priority lists of premium users. Whereas these access points may be low in the list or excluded from the network priority list policies of non premium users. Another example may simply be ranking user preferred or user owned access points higher on that user s specific network priority policy list.

In the sixth example user suggestions for improving performance access point list policies or modified access point list policies may be delivered to devices or connection managers device controllers by either the advanced profiling client or policy manager for use. Access point list policies may then be visually displayed to users either in a list or on a map so that users may see where they are relative to highest quality access points. In this way users know where to go to get better quality of service. These lists may be displayed over the advanced profiling client if it is present on the device otherwise they may be displayed by a connection manager device controller or a third party application .

In the final example load balancing and load management devices provide wireless service providers with a sense of load quality of service and congestion across their networks. Wireless service providers depending on the case may use processes outside the scope of this embodiment to understand their networks otherwise they may leverage access point profiles and connection profiles provided by this embodiment. The advanced profiling client can then use network load quality of service and congestion information to modify policies from the policy manager to perform load balancing and load management. For example if an access point is overloaded with network traffic it will be moved down the modified access point policy list Policy . Hence that access point will receive fewer new connections to support. Likewise relatively unloaded access points may be moved up the list. In this way network connection priority policies may be modified to perform load balancing and load management.

In both Scenario A and B Access Point A provides excellent service at the front of the building and terrible service at the back. Likewise Access Point B provides excellent service at the back of the building and terrible service at the front. Hence determining location of the user which we have determined is problematic is crucial for determining which access point to connect to. This embodiment proposes an approach that does not require the user s absolute geographic location instead it requires relative wireless location.

Then once these results are processed by the analytic systems of this invention the connection matrix of mobile device depicting which access point to connect to would then be as shown in . This matrix system can be extended to include any number of access points and mobile devices . Hence all mobile devices help to build upon a connection matrix or series of connection matrices so that they may all leverage the experiences of the other mobile devices . When a mobile device scans its environment it receives back a series of access point identifiers BSSID SSID etc. and the Signal Strength RSSI etc. from those access points . The access points and their associated signal strengths are then compared to the connection matrices . If there is a match within X accuracy then the policy action to connect or not to connect to a particular access point will be eligible for use. Hence this approach never requires determining geographic location instead it utilizes a relative location to the wireless environment. This same system may be extended to incorporate any number of other variables including time of day application being used the specific user s profile etc. In essence all variables for effective offloading could be applied using this system. As well all profile types described could be built using this method. In addition the X match requirement to perform the policy action would apply to the full set of policy conditions . This system and approach may be extended to systems that determine when targeted marketing messages and other location based services should be pushed to mobile devices.

Referring to multiple QoS measures are collected from Wi Fi access points. These may include but are not limited to throughput latency jitter and packet loss. For classification purposes initial weights and averages may be selected. For simplicity this example will only consider measure types of throughput and latency. This process describes one process for classification that would be covered by this embodiment.

Hence this example is not intended to limit the scope of the embodiment to this particular process or the use of only two variables.

Now consider a connection quality report that indicates that a user received a measured value of 1000 Kbps and 50 ms latency. Assume that this one report does not affect the averages. The final value is calculated as shown. This is just one class value one could be calculated for each QoS report. Depending on how many classes are required ranges will be established for classification. shows 4 classes as an example classification scheme for an access point s quality.

However through an analytic iterative process if it s determined that users connections to class 1 access points are often having a worse experience than classes 2 3 or 4 then it can be determined that the weightings used to determine the classifications must be refined. Otherwise the classification system may need to be made specific to the application currently being used on the wireless device. These scenarios would be directly addressed by the analytic processes of this embodiment.

Service providers require mappings to interpret these broadcasted class values . It may be that for their particular users devices applications etc. that they have unique network requirements. Hence they may benefit from an analytic process which generates a mapping or a set of mappings which works best for their users.

For example the value of 13.8 which was calculated above may on an average basis be interpreted by devices as meaning that connections will provide 13.8 better throughput than average and 13.8 better latency than average. However this is not likely to be the case. The wireless service provider may determine that this value is too high or too low compared to the experience that their customers are receiving. Likewise the wireless service provider may determine that the classification system is using weightings that they do not agree with in which case they will need to map how to translate these values into a QoS estimate that is useful for their users devices applications etc.

Consider an access point that broadcasts a class value of 20 as an example to wireless devices. Now if a wireless service provider determines that their users only experience roughly 10 better than normal performance on this access point instead of 20 they would apply a mapping of minus 10. Subtracting 10 from the Class Value will be the first mapping.

Now say a wireless service provider looks closer and determines that their users are receiving 10 worse latency than average and 20 better throughput than average. A further mapping for this access point may be determined using weighted values.

Please note that the process of substituting x into the equation to determine the relative weight values only works because we are considering two variables i.e. throughput and latency . If more than two variables are being considered more sets of known QoS readings and their associated class values must be considered together in order to solve the system of equations and determine the weight values.

Hence after the two mappings the service provider s combined mapping through an ongoing iterative process has become 

Now if a device is trying to determine whether or not it should connect to an access point of a particular broadcasted class value this system of equations may be solved to determine an estimate of the throughput and latency that would be received over that connection. This mapping has therefore given the device a better sense of whether or not the connection would be appropriate.

Please note that this is merely an example of the analytics processes covered by this embodiment for determining appropriate QoS profiles QoS classification schemes and service provider QoS mappings. In general analytic processes that leverage information from multiple data sources or devices to perform an ongoing iterative refinement process to solve for these items is covered by the embodiment.

We have previously discussed supporting this need by broadcasting QoS classes however it is equally possible to support the need for pre connection estimations by broadcasting classes of access point and access network congestion.

In this application QoS broadcasts differ from congestion broadcasts in how they are expressed and interpreted. QoS is usually defined in terms of network measures such as throughput latency etc. Congestion on the other hand is expressed in term of how much traffic is running through the access point or what percent of the total access point or network s capacity is being used.

Hence analytic processes will be required to determine how to best combine several congestions measures into one class value which is representative of total congestion. Further analytic processes will be required to determine a system for mapping how downlink IP traffic congestion classes can be best translated into over the air IEEE 802.11 traffic QoS estimations. This mapping is likely to be wireless service provider specific and may need to be transferred to the device for use. This mapping will allow devices to interpret the congestion broadcasts and estimate what their likely IP traffic quality would be after a connection is established.

Multiple congestion measures are collected from Wi Fi access points and network management systems. These may include but are not limited to percent of total rated bandwidth being used how close latency is to a limit of what is acceptable how many users are connected etc. This process describes one process for congestion classification that would be covered by this embodiment. Hence this two variable example is not intended to limit the scope of the embodiment to this particular process or the use of only two variables.

Now consider a congestion report that indicates that the network is 9 10 the way to reaching limit X and 8 10 the way to reaching limit Y. Depending on how many congestion classes are required ranges will be established for classification. shows 4 classes as an example classification scheme for an access point s congestion.

However through an analytic iterative process if it s determined that users connections to class 1 access points are often having a worse experience than classes 2 3 or 4 then it can be determined that the weightings used to determine the classifications must be refined. These scenarios would be directly addressed by the analytic processes of this embodiment.

Wireless service providers require mappings to interpret these broadcasted congestion class values and translate them into connection QoS estimations. It may be that for their particular users devices applications etc. that they have unique network requirements. Hence they may benefit from an analytic process which generates a mapping or a set of mappings which works best for their users.

The example just considers expected connection throughput and latency and shows an example mapping . If an access point which broadcasts a particular congestion class value provides QoS measures after connection which aren t consistent with this mapping then the service providers mapping scheme would be refined to reflect this. That mapping change may as an example reflect the mapping processes presented for QoS mappings previously.

If a device is trying to determine whether or not it should connect to an access point of a particular broadcasted congestion class value the mapping may be used to determine an estimate of the throughput and latency that would be received over that connection. This mapping has therefore given the device a better sense of whether or not the connection would be appropriate.

If the Device would like to determine which access point it should connect to it passes either its location or the BSSIDs SSIDs and RSSIs of the nearby access points to the Policy Manager . The Policy Manager then asks the Advanced Profiling Client to prioritize these access points and send back the resulting list. The Advanced Profiling Client does this by querying for the appropriate Modified Policy from the database. Once this list is passed back to the Policy Manager the Policy Manager distributes it to the Device for use.

In this embodiment it is possible that the Policy Manager Advanced Profiling Server and Advanced Profiling Client will be implemented on the same server. Likewise it possible for the Logs and Modified Policies to be held in the same database. Further this aggregate database could be held on the same server as the Policy Manager Advanced Profiling Server and Advanced Profiling Client . In some cases this embodiment will be used to exclusively manage access point priority policies.

All the servers mentioned may be viewed as being implemented in a cloud infrastructure. As well the definition of device controllers includes but is not limited to systems that control the entity holding the device controller itself or alternatively entities that send control messages to various interconnected devices.

Although the discussion of the embodiment has been exemplified in the context of wireless networks it will be understood that the embodiment can be applied to other fields where dynamic policy management brings benefits. For example one such field is the management of electricity grids where load management is critical. Moreover in the manufacturing industry or the home more and more devices have intelligent controllers for example under the control of devices such as smart phones and therefore dynamic policy control in accordance with the embodiment can be used to change policy in accordance with user habits and external variables such as electricity tariffs.
