title: Artificial recharge system
abstract: An artificial recharge system and method for recharging an aquifer. The artificial recharge system includes a constructed wetland, a settling pond, and a porous recharge reservoir. The constructed wetland receives water from a surface water source and has aquatic vegetation used to remove sediments and chemicals from the water. The settling pond receives the water from the constructed wetland and provides additional sediment removal. The porous recharge reservoir, which is hydraulically connected to the aquifer, receives the water from the settling pond. The water flows by gravity from the porous recharge reservoir to the aquifer. A backflush tube installed within a sand layer in the porous recharge reservoir is used to remove sediment and particulates from the sand layer.

This application relates generally to a system and method of artificially recharging groundwater reservoirs.

Artificial recharge of ground water reservoirs has been used to augment water supplies and to improve water quality of some aquifers. Severe dewatering of the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer in Arkansas has occurred over the last 50 years resulting in falling water table levels over large areas and decreased water yields to existing wells. Thus there is a need to recharge the aquifer more efficiently than occurs naturally. Because of the large amount of water removed from the alluvial aquifer a substantial storage reservoir exists which if used effectively could be an effective alternative to above ground reservoir storage.

Previous attempts at recharging the aquifer have been costly and the recharge flow rates through the wells have been low. The recharge rates have been low because the performance of recharge through screened injection wells is adversely impacted by 1 air entrapment within the aquifer 2 sediments lodging within the aquifer 3 biofouling of the well screen and adjacent sediment and 4 swelling of clays due to incompatible water chemistry. Specific capacities during injection i.e. the rate of injection for a unit increase in hydraulic head have had at least one quarter the specific capacity of the pumped well. Similar conditions exist in major aquifer systems around the world.

Aquifers are artificially recharged to enhance the natural rate of recharge and to capture surface water during times of surplus. An aquifer that is less than fully saturated through its entire thickness has the capacity to hold additional ground water and may be artificially recharged if the system or method used is not cost prohibitive. A major cost in the process is treating the water prior to injection. If pre treatment can be eliminated particularly the flocculation of sediment by chemical treatment then artificial recharge of aquifers may be cost effective. Described herein is such a cost effective system and method for artificially recharging an aquifer.

The artificial recharge system described in this disclosure includes a constructed wetland a settling pond and a recharge gallery or pit. The constructed wetland passively filters out sediment and cleans the source water of potentially toxic substances. The settling pond separates the constructed wetland from the recharge gallery or pit and is used to remove additional sediment not filtered out in the constructed wetland. The recharge gallery has recharge wells constructed into the depleted aquifer and overlying filter layers consisting of sand and gravel. The recharge pit also has sand and gravel filter layers and a depth sufficient to intersect the receiving aquifer so that clean water discharging from the settling pond can flow directly from the recharge pit into the aquifer. A perforated backflush tube installed within the sand layer is used to suspend fine sediment and or organic material from the sand filter layer for removal. Clean water will flow into the aquifer as long as the water level in the receiving aquifer is less than the water level in the recharge gallery or pit and the permeability of the aquifer does not decrease deleteriously due to introduction of sediment biological fouling and or air entrainment.

An embodiment of an artificial recharge system is shown in . Water flow indicated by arrow from a surface water source e.g. a river lake or reservoir is routed by way of a regulated canal or pipeline to a constructed wetland which is used to remove sediment and improve surface water quality. Recharge should be done with water that meets public health standards especially if the aquifer is a drinking water supply. Water of improved water quality indicated by arrow is routed to a sediment settling pond to provide additional sediment removal if needed. Water indicated by arrow is then routed from the sediment settling pond to a recharge gallery . The recharge gallery contains one or more recharge wells . Alternatively the water can be routed to a recharge pit not shown which is excavated sufficiently deep to intersect the aquifer to be recharged and requires no recharge wells. A recharge pit is appropriate primarily for a shallow aquifer the top of which is within the reach of excavation equipment.

A cross section of the constructed wetland system is shown in . illustrates cascading water levels in the sequence of wetland cells . Also an impermeable clay bottom is used to retain water and to prevent water from flowing vertically downward before exiting the constructed wetland system .

The surface water flow out of the last wetland cell is then routed to the sediment settling pond as shown in . The sediment settling pond receives the treated water from the constructed wetland . Water level surface water within the sediment settling pond is maintained by adjusting an inlet control valve connected to a transfer pipe . By fully submerging the transfer pipe less mixing of air occurs when compared to allowing water to pour into an air filled vertical well bore. Water flows through the transfer pipe into the recharge gallery or recharge pit and continues to flow downward by gravity through a sand filter layer and a gravel filter layer installed within the recharge gallery . The sand filter layer is preferably comprised of fine or medium sized sand particles having dimensions of about 0.25 mm to about 1 mm. The size of the sand particles is sufficiently fine to filter out any remaining sediment but not so fine that the flow rate to the aquifer is too small. Also the sand size should be large enough so that it can settle faster than any trapped fine sediments during backflushing described below . The gravel filter layer is preferably comprised of well sorted gravel ranging from about 5 mm to about 20 mm. The water flow direction is indicated by arrows . The water flowing into the recharge gallery forms a water column above the sand filter layer .

The recharge wells are cased above the gravel layer to adequately allow the sand filter to remove any residual sediment or particulates. Casings of the recharge wells are sufficiently tall to prevent water from cascading down through the tops of the casings minimizing air entrainment. Water enters each recharge well through a well screen or mill slotted tubing and exits the well screen into an aquifer having a saturated alluvial aquifer and an unsaturated alluvial aquifer . The gravel filter layer positioned adjacent to the well screens and the sand filter layer filter the recharge water to prevent clogging of the recharge wells . Water bypasses impermeable material e.g. clay caliche or chalk depending upon the location of the recharge gallery and flows into the saturated alluvial aquifer or other permeable water bearing stratum. The water level ground water in the saturated alluvial aquifer rises as recharge progresses and the unsaturated zone of the alluvial aquifer diminishes. Natural processes that affect the water available for recharge include evaporation and precipitation . Excess surface water flows out of the recharge gallery via an overflow pipe which also helps to control water level in the recharge gallery .

Automated controls such as limit switches pressure sensors or flow meters that monitor and adjust inflow and outflow water may be added at desired points throughout the system. Also water quality monitoring sensors can be added to the constructed wetland to monitor e.g. turbidity specific conductance pH and or temperature and restrict inflow to the sediment settling pond . These water quality monitoring systems can be installed throughout the system to measure the effectiveness of the system in cleaning the initial surface water .

In another embodiment of the invention if the constructed wetland can provide water of sufficient quantity and quality to the recharge gallery then the sediment settling pond may not be needed. Alternatively if the source water is of excellent quality the water can be routed directly from the source to either the sediment settling pond or the recharge gallery .

The artificial recharge system described herein provides several advantages. First the combination of the constructed wetland with the passive recharge gallery utilizing gravity flow for filtering provides a low cost low energy system with minimal moving parts to wear out and no requirement for chemical treatment of the recharge water. Second the use of sand and gravel filters adjacent to the wells to filter the recharge water prevents clogging of the wells and the backflush mechanism removes sediment and particulates from the recharge water by suspending the fine sediment and organic materials above the sand filter bed. Further utilization of existing storage volume in the unsaturated zone frees up land surface area for agriculture or other purposes that might otherwise be used for a surface water reservoir. The storage of water under ground reduces evaporation that would otherwise occur in a surface water reservoir. Additionally the constructed wetland environment provides a habitat for wildlife and the wetland plants can be harvested for biofuel production.

Although the invention has been described relative to a specific exemplary embodiment thereof it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications and variations of the present invention are possible without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.
