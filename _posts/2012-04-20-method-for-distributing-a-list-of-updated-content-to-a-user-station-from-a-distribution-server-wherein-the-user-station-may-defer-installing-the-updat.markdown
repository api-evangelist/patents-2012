This is a combined Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08 641 010 filed on Apr. 29 1996 and entitled COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED TRANSPORT OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION OBJECTS which is a Continuation in Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08 251 724 filed on May 31 1994 and entitled SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC UNATTENDED ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TRANSPORT BETWEEN A SERVER AND A CLIENT BY A VENDOR PROVIDED TRANSPORT SOFTWARE WITH A MANIFEST LIST which as U.S. Pat. No. 5 694 546 on Dec. 2 1997 and U.S. application Ser. No. 08 982 157 filed on Dec. 1 1997 and entitled COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED TRANSPORT OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION OBJECTS which is a Continuation of the aforementioned Ser. No. 08 251 724 U.S. Pat. No. 5 694 546 . All of the above identified applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to computer implemented transport of electronic information objects. More specifically the present invention relates to software and corresponding methods for automatically fetching desired data from each of a plurality of independently operated data sources via a non proprietary network. A user station is also disclosed.

Electronic publication is an exploding industry in which thousands of new products including magazines and periodicals software applications and utilities video games business legal and financial information and databases encyclopedias and dictionaries are purchased by millions of customers. Commonly such information products are replicated in computer readable form on magnetic or optical storage diskettes and are box packaged with printed manuals for distribution to retail stores and direct mail sales. These marketing practices are relatively expensive and involve a significant time lag of at least days or weeks to get a product into a consumer s hands once it is created.

Such costs and delays are generally acceptable for original high value products such as collections of publications or software application of which some examples are NEWSWEEK Interactive CD ROM or disks which provides a searchable audio visual library of issues of NEWSWEEK magazine and CINEMANIA CD ROM which provides reviews and other information on newly released films. For time sensitive low value updates for example the latest issue of Newsweek or last week s movie reviews distribution in stored form on physical media is slow and the cost may exceed the value of the information in the product.

Thus electronic transfer from a central computer server to a subscriber s computer over common carriers or wide area networks is an attractive proposition. Similar considerations apply to the distribution of software program updates although cost and frequency of issue are not such serious constraints. A problem faced in both situations is that of incorporating the received material with the original material so that a fully integrated publication information database or software program is obtained by the user.

Another class of electronically distributed information product comprises home shopping catalogues of mail order products distributed on optical or other digital data storage disks which may contain text sound and images from printed catalogues or uniquely created material for example software application demos. To applicants knowledge and belief available products lack any computer order placement capability requiring orders to be placed by voice call.

Communication between remote computers not directly interconnected by umbilical cable or a wired network is enabled by a wide range of hardware devices and software drivers utilities applications and application modules. Telephone modems that couple a computer with the telephone network are familiar devices. RF modems that couple computers into wireless networks are less familiar but are beginning to appear in consumer devices known broadly as personal information communicators PIC s of which personal digital assistants PDA s such as Apple Corp. s NEWTON product are a first generation. New kinds of digital communications devices can be expected to emerge as digital technology replaces analog transmission.

General purpose online modem accessed electronic information services such as PRODIGY COMPUSERVE and AMERICA ONLINE trademarks and some Internet services provide wide access to timely information products from a central server but are limited and complex. They provide no means for the integration of downloaded information with information products offered on disk or CD and provide only rudimentary facilities for local viewing and search of downloaded files.

Such online information services provide their own user interface which is generally unlike that of a disk or CD based information product and can be customized very little if at all by a publisher using the service for product distribution.

Online services are oriented to extended online sessions which require complex user interaction to navigate and find desired information objects. Initial setup and use is rendered complex by requirements related to extended session use of data networks and the frequent need to navigate across the network and through massive data collections to locate desired data items. General purpose online information services do not provide a suitable medium for electronic information publishers to distribute updates and the like because of limited interface flexibility because a publisher cannot expect all their customer base to be service subscribers and because of cost and payment difficulties. Such services are centered on monolithic processes intended for national use by millions of subscribers which processes are not readily adaptable.

Online service charging mechanisms are also inflexible and inappropriate for most individual information products requiring monthly subscription fees of 5 10 or more plus time charges for extended use which are billed directly to users after a user sign up and credit acceptance process. Such cost mechanisms are too expensive and too complex for distribution of many products such as magazine and other low cost update products. They do not presently permit a publisher to build an access fee into a purchase price or a product subscription.

Recent press announcements from corporations such as AT T Lotus Microsoft and MCI describe plans for new online services providing what are called groupware services to offer rich electronic mail and group collaboration functions primarily for business organizations. Although offering multiple electronic object transport operations such services are believed to have complex setup procedures and software requirements and complex message routing features and protocols and to lack interface flexibility. Accordingly they are not suitable for mass distribution of low cost electronic information update products and cannot achieve the objectives of the invention.

Many software products exist that enable one computer to communicate with another over a remote link such as a telephone cable or the air waves but none enables a vendor substantially to automate common carrier mass distribution of an electronic information product to a customer base employing multiple heterogenous systems with indeterminate hardware and software configurations. Two examples of popular such software products are Datastorm Technologies Inc. s PROCOMM trademark and CENTRAL POINT COMMUTE trademark from Central Point Software Inc. which are commonly used to provide a variety of functions including file transfers between interactive sessions from host mode services from and remote computer management modem equipped personal computers wired into the telephone network.

Counterpoint Publishing Cambridge Mass. in brochures available to the applicant in November 1993 offered electronic information products entitled Daily Federal Register and CD Federal Register. Daily Federal Register includes communications software and a high speed modem. Apparently the communications software is a standard general purpose communications package with dialing scripts that are customized to the needs of the Federal Register products. Accordingly the cost of a communications package license which may be as high as about 100 at retail must be included within the product cost. Also Counterpoint Publishing avoids the difficulties of supporting various modems by providing its own standard modem with the product building in a cost about 100 200 which renders this approach quite unsuitable for mass market distribution of low cost electronic information update products. The resulting product is not seamless either in its appearance or its operation because the communications software is separately invoked and used and has its own disparate look and feel to the user.

The CD Federal Register provides the Federal Register on CD ROM at weekly intervals for 1 950.00 and CD ROM disks are shipped to customers as they become available. Back issues are 125 each. Updates are provided by shipping a disk. The Federal Register is a high value product intended for specialist business academic and governmental users. Distribution of updates on CD ROM as utilized by Counterpoint Publishing is not a suitable method for lower value products such as a weekly news magazine because of the associated costs. Shipping delays are a further drawback.

While the two product CD Federal Register and Daily Federal Register might be used together at an additive cost to provide a combination of archives on CD ROM plus daily updates obtained and stored until replaced by anew CD ROM based on information available to the present inventor it appears that the two products must be used separately. Thus they must apparently be viewed searched and managed as two or more separate collections requiring multiple steps to perform a complete search across both collections and requiring manual management and purging of the current collection on hard disk by the user.

Xcellenet Inc. in product brochures copyrighted 1992 and a price list dated Aug. 16 1993 for a REMOTEWARE product line offers a range of REMOTEWARE software only products providing electronic information distribution to and from remote nodes of a proprietary REMOTEWARE computer network intended for use within an organized corporate or institutional data processing or management information system. The system is primarily server directed rather than user initiated and requires an expensive program priced at 220.00 to run at the user s node whereas the present invention addresses consumer uses which will support costs of no more than a few dollars per node.

Furthermore REMOTEWARE is primarily intended to be used with other REMOTEWARE products at the node which other products provide a range of user interface and data management functions at significant additional cost each with their own separate user interface presenting a standard REMOTEWARE look and feel. In addition the nodes require a sophisticated central support and operations function to be provided which may be difficult for an electronic information publisher to accomplish and add unacceptable expense.

REMOTEWARE is overly elaborate to serve the simpler objectives of the present invention. Designed for the demanding needs of enterprise wide data processing communications the client or node package provides many functions such as background operation ability to receive calls from the server at any time ability to work under control of the central server to survey and update system software and files and an ability to support interactive sessions which abilities are not needed to carry out the simpler information transport operations desired by the present invention. Such capabilities may be desirable in an enterprise MIS environment but are not appropriate to a consumer or open commercial environment and bring the drawbacks of complexity cost and program size which may put undesirable operational constraints on the user and perhaps even compromise the user s privacy . REMOTEWARE is too costly and complex for mass distribution of updates to periodicals cannot be shipped invisibly with an electronic information product and requires specialized server software and operations support that would challenge all but the largest and most technically sophisticated publishers. Accordingly REMOTEWARE is unsuitable for widespread use as an economical means of distributing updates for a variety of electronic information products.

Although it has wider applications a significant problem addressed by the invention is the problem of economically distributing updates of electronic information products to a wide customer base that may number tens or hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of consumers. At the date of this invention such a customer base will normally include an extensive variety of computers operating systems and communications devices if the latter are present all of which may have their own protocols and configuration requirements.

While an electronic information product vendor might consider licensing or purchasing an existing commercial communications product for distribution with their publication product to enable remote diskless updating the high cost of such a solution would generally be unacceptable because a communication package includes a broad range of functionalities not required for the vendor s particular purpose for example remote keyboarding. Significantly a commercial communications package is not susceptible to customization of its user interface and may have its own configuration requirements and installation requirements with regard to directories device drivers and the like which are incompatible with other vendor or user requirements or are simply a nuisance to the user. Thus a commercial communications product in addition to its cost cannot be satisfactorily integrated with an information product.

There is accordingly a need for computer implementable information transport software to enable simple economical and prompt mass distribution of electronic information products.

This invention solves a problem. It solves the problem of enabling simple economical and prompt mass distribution of electronic information products.

In one aspect the present invention provides a method for controlling a user station configured for communications with a multiplicity of independently operated data sources via a non proprietary network. Advantageously the method includes steps for providing a user interface to enable a user at the user station to select multiple ones of the multiplicity of independently operated data object sources to be polled automatically polling each of the selected data object sources in order to determine availability of desired data at each of the selected data object sources and automatically transporting desired data determined to be available from each of the selected data object sources to the user station.

According to another aspect the present invention provides a method for controlling a user station configured for communications with a multiplicity of independently operated data sources via a non proprietary network including steps for providing a user interface to enable a user at the user station to select multiple ones of the multiplicity of independently operated data object sources automatically effecting respective communication sessions with each of the selected data object sources and automatically fetching desired data from each of the selected data object sources during each of the respective communication sessions.

According to another aspect the present invention provides software stored on a computer readable storage medium at a user station configured for communications with a multiplicity of independently operated data sources via a non proprietary network. Preferably the software provides a plurality of functions including an interface function that provides a user interface to enable a user at the user station to select multiple ones of the multiplicity of independently operated data object sources to be polled a polling function that automatically polls each of the selected data object sources in order to determine availability of desired data at each of the selected data object sources and a transport function that automatically transports desired data determined to be available from each of the selected data object sources to the user station.

According to another aspect the present invention provides software stored on a computer readable storage medium at a user station configured for communications with a multiplicity of independently operated data sources via a non proprietary network. Preferably the software provides a plurality of functions including an interface function that provides a user interface to enable a user at the user station to select multiple ones of the multiplicity of independently operated data object sources a communication function that automatically effects respective communication sessions with each of the selected data object sources and a fetch function that automatically fetches desired data from each of the selected data object sources during each of the respective communication sessions.

Referring to the inventive software component is schematically shown in operative mode installed at a user s computer workstation. The workstation is communications equipped for communication with remote services for example by modem which services are also shown schematically. Only relevant software and hardware components of the system are shown.

Relevant components at the workstation comprise operating system services a containing information product an information transport component or module herein also referenced as a transporter which may be a stand alone product or in preferred embodiments is embedded or contained in the containing information product . Information transport component provides a general purpose facility for sending and fetching information objects between an end user s computer the client and a central server. Information transport component is not customized to the containing information product but is intended to be used in conjunction with any of a wide range of electronic information products.

Operating system services provide capabilities for the containing information product and the information transport component to access a readable information storage device which may for example be an optical disk drive such as a read only CD ROM where product information is stored. In addition a read write information storage device for example a conventional hard disk is accessed via the operating system services for storage of a fetched additional information object . The storage media used for hard disks and the like are often described as nonvolatile and the type of storage is frequently referenced as permanent however the more recently used term persistent storage which references the manner of storage as well as the physical storage media and distinguishes from transient storage where objects may be automatically erased after some interval or event without supervisory control or awareness of the erasure is a more suitable descriptive term for the purposes of the present invention.

As necessary different or modified information transporter components can be supplied for users of different operating systems or system families notably DOS available in several versions for example from Microsoft Corp IBM Corporation Novell Inc. Windows trademark Microsoft Corp. Apple Computer Corp. s operating systems possibly IBM Corporation s OS 2 trademark and any distinct operating systems developed for personal digital assistants pen based computers and the like.

Information transport component also uses operating system services for external communication with a communications network through which the information transport component can access a remote server or server client network supporting a data storage device where desired additional information object is located.

Communications network can be any electronic distribution system suitable for transporting information objects including wired and wireless common carriers such as telephone networks cable television systems or networks and mobile telecommunications or data communications networks and extends also to emerging and future systems of providing electronic communication between users of diversified equipment. The term common carrier is used herein to embrace all such data communication systems as will reasonably meet the purposes of the invention. The term modem is used herein to embrace any network interface device enabling a user station to communicate on such a communications network .

While the containing information product can take many different forms as described herein and as will also be apparent to those skilled in the art a preferred embodiment is that of a periodically issuing publication or publications for example a news magazine or a collection of patents. Again the additional information object could be any information of interest to the user having some relevance to the containing information product but the invention and its unique capabilities enable the additional information object to be fully integrated with the containing product in a manner that can be automated to be transparent to the user.

The inventive information transport component is designed to require a minimum of user input. A bare minimum will be a user s ID which can be entered by the user in a product setup and automatically accessed for information transport or could by pre loaded by the vendor from data supplied by the user at purchase.

A product ID is preferably pre loaded into the containing information product by the information product vendor or publisher to be available for use by the information transport component . However even this may not be required. In an alternative embodiment the product ID can be automatically incorporated into the product in a product replication process that permits individualized coding of unique ID s. In most cases a user actuated menu selection is provided in the containing information product after integration with the inventive information transport component to activate transport of an additional information object and preferably selection of transport activation drops down a menu of transport choices such as FETCH UPDATE FETCH CATALOG OF UPDATES SEND DATA and the like each of which then runs automatically upon selection.

Updating can also be totally automatic and other than an obviously desirable user notification be completely invisible to or transparent to the user running in background on their system while the user s screen is available for other processing such as running the containing information product . Where updates are made available on a known schedule a totally automated product can be provided that fetches an update without any user intervention on the specified release date or as soon thereafter as the user s system or the containing information product is activated. In practice most users will probably prefer an opportunity to confirm that the fetch transaction should proceed. A preferred embodiment monitors the user s system clock and alerts a user to the arrival of an update release date and asks the user to confirm that the system should seek and fetch the scheduled update if available.

Thus the invention is particularly suitable for importing updates of information or information processing products such as periodically issuing literature or software upgrades. Accordingly additional information object preferably comprises updates which can be integrated with the information product to provide for example a coherent body or continuous sequence of materials that can be commonly searched and indexed preferably in a manner giving the user the appearance of a common logical file formed from physically distinct files. The appearance of integration can be achieved by searching new and then old indexes in series and making the search and navigation logic of the containing product smart enough to combine new and old information. For example a new object can have an index file similar to that for the original information product . A search engine can first search the new index then the old one and then produce a combined set of results. Preferably the files are not actually merged or otherwise combined as to do so could be unduly complex.

As shown in the containing information product comprises a user interface enabling the user to view search excerpt and print or otherwise export or process selected information items from product information . The user interface provides standard information product features as conventionally supplied by the product publisher supplemented by appropriate fetch or send options to activate the features of the inventive information transport component .

Also shown in area database management module and a data structure definition module . Database management module provides retrieval oriented database processing of the information product including indexed searching and selective retrieval capabilities using one or more index keys such as an issue or item number or full text searching and may provide hypertext and hypermedia linkages. The data structure definition provides the database structure of relevant files as classified by field or element name type size and the like. After successful completion of a fetch operation control is returned to containing information product to process the new information in essentially the same manner as the original information or in any other manner for which it has been equipped.

Major modules comprised in the inventive information transport component are a user interface a communications module and fetch send protocol . In addition the information transport component preferably comprises its own built in application programming interfaces APIs such as a user interface API and a communications API enabling the information transport component s user interface and communications modules respectively readily to be incorporated with or plugged into a wide range of containing information products . Such incorporation in the currently best known embodiment of the invention is effected by software engineers familiar with and having access to the containing information product but future developments may enable the incorporation process to be effected by skilled users.

References herein to an applications programming interface API will be understood to embrace any program interconnection technique which supports direct seamless interaction between one program and another including procedural calls object encapsulation or emerging techniques like Microsoft Corp. s Object Linking and Embedding OLE or Apple Computer s Open Doc.

API is responsible for providing means for the user to interact with the information transport functions of the invention and interface as seen by the user and API is responsible for handling internal processes of communications and data management.

The APIs and are intended to enable the information transport component to be used by a range of product programs controlling a variety of information products and to enable each API and to be free to exercise flexibility and creativity in extending its associated user interface data management module and database structure to fully address the provision of transport functions for the purposes described herein.

API operates on a transport function level involving high level interactions between the containing product or the user or the optional user interface and the transporter before and after communications while the detailed low level interactions between the transporter client and the server during communications are handled by fetch send protocol without involvement of the containing product or the user. High level is used to refer to a level at which software interacts with a user typically in simple readily comprehensible function oriented graphic or everyday language terms while low level refers to a level of detailed procedural interaction with an operating system or device modem port etc. in obscure program or machine language terms incomprehensible to most users.

Fetch send protocol is in the preferred embodiment shown a component of a novel client server communications procedure designed to manage the transaction oriented transmissions required to achieve satisfactory transport of desired server stored information objects and optionally central reporting of user information in a predetermined format. Alternatively one or more existing protocols could be used.

Preferably the API s and and the fetch send protocol are structured to use a manifest list to control the exchange of information objects. The manifest list can be provided in fetch send protocol and can be forwarded to remote server to provide better efficiency error control and management of the operation. Alternatively the manifest list may remain resident at the user s station. The manifest is valuable operating at the client station at the API level to specify the actions required during a transport session and can in one embodiment comprise a list of send and fetch operations which are individually controlled.

This software mechanism employing novel communications procedures and applications interfaces that reference an object manifest provides a new way for performing a wide variety of information exchange functions in a simple standardized and economical manner.

In preferred embodiments API and API include a product setup routine of an application specific configuration which is used by the publisher or product developer prior to publication to establish seamless compatibility between the containing information product and the information transport component for smooth execution of desired transport functions. A completion status code is also specified.

The application specific configuration posts user and product ID information as needed to process password or other access code authentication and posts files information including designation of an application work directory and a transporter work directory for performing the transporter functions of information transport component .

Additionally the application specific configuration sets up an appropriate decompression or compression for send objects technique according to the expected format and condition of fetched information objects which information is pre coded into communications component .

The application specific configuration established through API selects either a standard user interface as furnished with information transport component or an application controlled user interface. Control settings are established for connection problem handling disk error handling abort and server condition handling access denial unavailability of information object files and any other error situations which may occur during transport.

If desired optional advanced controls for scheduled automatic calling can be included in the application specific configuration used in preparing the containing information product for publication.

Preparation of containing information product and incorporation of information transport component therein with an application specific configuration as described is carried out prior to publication to build a customized ready to run version of the product with automated update capability.

Communications API establishes a product specific transport method choice list for selection of an appropriate file transfer protocol as between direct dial data network dial and other modes of transport. Communications protocols specify necessary connection parameters such as access number and network addressing or other routing information. Optional script choices can provide for different modes of transport.

These product specific configurations and protocols enable information transport component to be packaged in executable form with containing information product with all necessary product specific components and settings including a standard user interface if selected ready for inclusion in the product package.

If desired at the option of the information product publisher a standard user interface may be included. Such an optional standard user interface can have all facilities needed to select transportable objects from a predefined list perform all user setup functions and invoke information object transport.

Additional options are standard software that would allow the user to search view and print the transported objects totally independently of the user interface and database search components of the containing product. Both such options enable a publisher to exploit the inventive transport product for efficiently and economically providing updates without having to make changes to the publisher s containing product simply by configuring the transporter or information transport component and physically including it and the optional components within the containing product.

A standard viewer might handle only ASCII text but it preferably could provide for other useful formats such as standard word processor spreadsheet or database formats or multimedia formats such as video sound and HTML hypertext markup language a format becoming popular on the Internet and which provides the ubiquitous Web pages for the Internet s World Wide Web.

Compatibility with the user s system is effected by API establishing a user specific configuration and creating or updating the necessary control files.

Parameters established in the user specific configuration include a setup ID number to permit use of multiple setups for example for different transport options and a product ID number.

The user specific configuration posts user ID information and a password or other access code authentication and posts files information including disk and drive designation for work and data directories. Autocall options and a completion status code are also specified.

API provides information for communications module specifying a user communications protocol for the user s hardware operating system line configuration and so on. Thus for a standard telephone connection comm port speed baud rate interrupt settings modem type and control strings dial prefix dial 9 pulse or tone call waiting shut off and the like are specified as appropriate. Additionally the user communications protocol includes access number and connection parameters optionally with script selection for routing choices via data networks and so on.

The resultant user specific configuration and communications protocols generated through API create a setup ready to call and places it in the designated transporter work area. A validation procedure checks entries and reports obvious errors in parameter settings.

Preferably multiple product ID setups are provided to enable multiple information products to use the transporter with an appropriate compatible transporter version. Preferably also the user specific configuration accommodates shared use of the transporter work areas by multiple information product applications resident on the same user s system.

User fetch send protocol working in cooperation with server fetch send protocol controls the desired information object transport function calling remote server and exchanging data objects. It performs or supervises communications between the user s system and remote server .

Communications module uses a setup ID number specified through API or selects which setup to use for a call calls remote server using protocol and in a preferred embodiment sends an object manifest comprising a send object list a fetch object list or both. Such manifest is created under control of user interface from a pre existing set of choices supplied with the product or obtained during previous update operations or both.

Alternatively fetch send protocol may refer to a pre existing manifest list stored at the user s station or may be directed by remote server to select one of multiple pre existing manifest lists stored at the user s station. As another alternative although it is convenient and advantageous to transmit the manifest list to the server the relevant status and management information can simply be used locally by communications module and be integrated into the individual fetch and send protocols.

A send object list comprises object action codes specifying the type of server action required if any object names object sizes and response object size if any. A fetch object list comprises object names object sizes and an object availability date.

A completed object manifest is employed to convey the status of the transport operation and to provide for additional information transport if desired. The completed object manifest adds the following to the request object manifest send object additional information object acceptance codes returned by server time of acceptance and a response object name if called for by the object action code.

For a fetch operation the completed object manifest adds the following to the request object manifest fetch object additional information a fetch confirmation or failure code the time of completion or failure and a revised availability date if the requested fetch object was unavailable.

If a scheduled update or polling option is present and selected a scheduling or polling indicator is included and a completion of processing or import function to call through API is specified.

A completion status code terminates the fetch or send operation and returns control to the information product application or the provided user interface.

Communications module employing the described fetch send mechanism comprised by cooperating protocols and performs the functions necessary to complete an information transport operation as described herein under a variety of circumstances with tolerance for a common range of error conditions open drives inadequate disk space lost line connections and the like without losing control of the user s system. Using correct verified ID naming and routing information the information transport operation employing the inventive information transport component is less error prone than many computer users would be were they effecting the transport operation with conventional technology requiring them to enter routing and storage information and the like manually.

Communications module verifies that all send objects are as specified that all fetch objects are scheduled to be available verifies that sufficient disk space is available for all fetch objects and for compressed transmission copies of all objects and returns an error report if any of these requirements is not fulfilled.

Communications module performs communications then returns a completed object manifest and logs all activity in a transporter log file. If an optional scheduling polling feature is selected the communication is deferred until the scheduled time.

These general objectives are achieved by carrying out the following process steps after an application or optionally a transporter user interface requests a transport function 

Connections are made via phone line or network. The system handshakes and identifies the call to the server.

The product checks the completion code and completed object manifest to deal with any error conditions. The application performs any required import processing on fetched objects to integrate the data and indexes with prior data as desired to enable seamless use. If desired import processing can include or offer as a user selection file maintenance functions relevant to the information product including for example file purging to remove obsolete information files and preserve the user s storage space. Specifications of files to be deleted can be included with the original product or with a fetch object. In either event the responsibility for accurate specification is passed to the vendor relieving the user of the risk of making erroneous deletions and anxiety attendant thereon. After such import processing the containing information product or the optional separate user interface then returns control to the user for use of the received data.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the identification of files in the object manifest or for file maintenance functions as the user station or for any other purpose of the invention can be effected generically for example by using wild card characters as is customary in file specification and which effectively permits multiple objects to be specified as a class related by file name characteristics or related individually thereby providing options for specifying of such class of multiple objects to proceed at one time or in a series of transports over time. Other algebraical identification methods can be used which may reference object versions in series or comparable characteristics.

The foregoing steps are illustrated in the flow block diagram of . When containing information product issues an information transport call setup filter runs setup routine if this is a first call and no information transport setup was run on installation of containing information product . At block an object manifest is retrieved for pre transport preparation at block . After prepping a call to server is established at block and when the connection is made and a handshake performed one or more objects is transported at block .

After completion of transport and receipt of a completion manifest server is disconnected at block received objects are decompressed and unpacked at block and stored in a designated disk storage location at block . Object storage triggers containing information product s import processing to assimilate the information update with the original information product at block following which a completion report is issued at and control is returned to the containing information product at .

An optional transport function module for scheduled or poll responsive information object transport can be provided to defer the fetching of an update or to defer another information transport operation to a specified later time or until called by the server.

The optional transport function schedules a request waits then automatically performs the transport operation at the scheduled time. In polling mode it activates and if necessary interrupts and then reactivates the user station s ability to receive calls.

Mechanics of the optional transport function include a request for an ID number an indicator for calling or polling mode and a schedule iterating a call time a retry protocol call activation and timing along with an authentication procedure for the server and a completion status code.

Communications between the information transport component functioning as a client and the server follow a predefined communications procedure having cooperative user components comprising user fetch send protocol and server fetch send protocol .

Server client intercommunication can be broken down into five steps a login b manifest transmission c send operation d fetch operation and e logout as described in more detail below.

Login establishes a session with an authorized client. A handshake process between user protocol and server protocol identifies the user s transporter client system to remote server by product ID and user ID and a password or other authentication code. A failure reason code is given to rejected clients.

Preferably via user protocol the user system issues an information object transport request manifest to server . Server verifies its ability to meet the request by returning a manifest acknowledgment specifying which elements will be processed and provides reason codes for declined elements. Alternatively as stated previously manifest functions can be listed in individual send and fetch protocols.

If the user system outputs a send object through information transport component and protocol server receives and accepts the send objects and stares them identified by product ID and user ID. Error control and retry mechanisms are employed and successful receipt of the send object is acknowledged and logged.

If the action code calls for a response object the server obtains necessary processing from a pre designated external source corresponding to the product ID and action code and returns the response as a fetch object called a response object.

The server obtains requested fetch objects by product ID and object name and forwards them to the transporter at the user. Error control and retry mechanisms are employed and successful transmissions are acknowledged and logged.

The server transmits the completed object manifest to the transporter confirms and logs receipt and ends the session.

In the prior art embodiment of many operations require active participation by the user who for example must at least initiate any pre transport preparation of the information object such as checking the specifications checking work space available to store a fetched object and conducting any other preliminary checks. The user has to activate a communications product specify a call route and after the call connection is established specify the objects and initiate a transport operation. Communications product operating in a cooperative manner with remote server will execute establish call connection after the call route phone number has been specified and will execute transport objects after the objects to be transported are specified by the user. Disconnection is usually effected by a user executing a call termination command which if the user is inattentive or inefficient may be delayed longer than necessary to complete the transport operation running up unnecessary line or air time charges.

After completion of the transport operations user has to deactivate the communications product and then initiate any required storing and processing of the fetched product . While some of these steps may be automated via one or more batch files scripts or macros a vendor of a containing information product has great difficulty in furnishing such a batch file or macro for a mass market distribution because of the different systems and communications products encountered in amass market which systems and products have a variety of different specifications performance characteristics and unique incompatible scripting languages.

Equally while some more skilled users might be able to write their own batch files without undue difficulty to automate some of these steps. Many users will lack the ability or the inclination to do so. Also the effort would not be justified for a single transport operation. Nor is the result of such efforts likely to match the ease and simplicity of the results achieved by the present invention which enables even a first update to be obtained effortlessly with the software running in unattended mode after initiation.

Referring to user selects a transport operation from a user interface screen in containing information product whereupon the latter calls information transport component to activate transport. Information transport component implements any necessary pre transport preparation and then employing its own communications module and server fetch send protocol proceeds in unattended mode without requiring user intervention to establish call connection to execute transport object and automatically perform a disconnect as described herein.

Automatic transport control and disconnection is a useful feature of the invention providing economy of line or air time charges and reducing congestion on the communications carrier. Using conventional communications products especially with online services the duration of the connection may be unnecessarily extended by the delays and potential errors inherent in user control resulting in increased communications costs and failures. The inventive transporter provides software control of the connection duration enabling it to be confined to a period sufficient to effect said unattended object transfer enhancing efficient use of the communications medium.

Also as described the operation can be monitored or controlled by employing an object manifest and is facilitated by the use of pre specified addresses and transport characteristics. After satisfactorily completing the transport the information transport component automatically deactivates and returns control to containing information product preferably with a satisfactory completion report which containing information product notifies to user through the containing information product user interface.

If the transport object was a product update optionally a store and process of fetched object is initiated by information transport component and execution of the store and process operation may be passed to the containing information product . The user can now use the updated product.

As shows when read in comparison with the invention enables a user to be relieved of all duties save for minimal selection and notification functions while no complex added functionality is demanded of containing information product . Optional store and process or fetched object is contemplated as requiring only minimal modification of existing containing information product functions while other more complex procedural and detailed transport related functions are handled by the information transport component .

Some non limiting examples illustrative of practical commercial and industrial applications of the invention will now be described.

Some weekly news magazines offer subscriptions to a quarterly CD ROM which contains multimedia material plus a searchable full text database of the most recent quarter s weekly magazine issues and enabling application software. Newer issues are not provided until the next quarterly disc is mailed. Accordingly the CD ROM electronic magazine product steadily becomes out of date and its value lessens.

The invention incorporates an information transport component with a news magazine product stored on a CD ROM to enable a user to fetch an information object in the form of new issues and their associated search indexes from a remote server as they become available for example weekly. The fetched updates are stored on a consumer s computer hard disk storage device . Because of the size of rich content multimedia files the updates are limited to text material including full texts of interim issues and associated files such as indexes. Because it knows the storage location of the updates the next CD ROM issue can include as an install option or upon first access a request to delete the old now outdated updates from hard disk creating space for new updates.

User interface in conjunction with user interface contains code providing a menu selection enabling a user to activate the update fetch operation and then to provide integrated or seamless access to the combined data searching both the hard disk storage device and the CD using both sets of indexes so that the contents are viewable as a single collection although an additional independent searching viewing function for the updates could be provided if desired.

A product setup routine adapts the information transport component to work with the news magazine CD ROM s existing software for creation of a user interface searching and viewing. Communications options may be limited to direct telephone dial only. A simple user interface addition controls a setup process allowing the user to enter a unique user ID provided with each copy of the CD ROM distribution disk and to create predetermined work areas on the user s hard disk.

A schedule of updates with names dates and files sizes is provided in the containing news magazine product on the CD ROM and is accessed via user interface in conjunction with user interface to create a fetch object manifest . Optionally user interface in conjunction with user interface creates a send object manifest to control transport of user demographics for market analysis or for renewals or the like in the opposite direction from the user to the server with the send operation being triggered whenever the next transport operation is activated or optionally by allowing the user to trigger it.

A fetched information object such as an update is automatically decompressed and stored on hard disk storage device as additional information object for integration with the original CD ROM product so that the user can view both the update and the original issues and run searches across the entire collection.

Optionally initial location of additional information object may be an application work area location on storage device and communications component may be pre set to pass control via API to database management module which will do further processing to integrate additional objects in accordance with the existing database structure to provide a more complete level of integration permitting for example viewing of combined menus nullification of obsoleted items and cross linking of hypertext elements.

If a send object has been prepared and included in the object manifest such as a send object containing user information entered during the install process or subscription request information obtained from the user it is sent to server to be stored and identified by product and user ID for appropriate action in due course. Acknowledgment of receipt of the send object is noted by communications component and passed back to the user if such provision is made in user interface .

Both the fetch and send operations are closed ended in the sense of being operations that are pre described in the original information product and once triggered can be completed without human intervention of any kind.

To service the automated update facility running at the user s workstation remote server is set up to accept calls from valid user ID s and is loaded with new issue text and index files in the form of update information object according to a publication schedule.

Open ended access to supplemental information objects not described in the original information product can be obtained by providing in the original product means to fetch a directory of added features. This can be used for example by a news magazine publisher to provide special news features on an unplanned basis or each weekly issue could be packaged with a directory of additional features available. The user first specifies a fetch of the new directory or receives it along with a fetched update they have specified from a user interface menu and then views the fetched additional features directory and initiates a fetch of a selected additional item or items in a second information object transport operation using an information object manifest built from the new features directory.

The original containing product news magazine CD ROM user interface preferably has provision for importing and viewing any information objects listed on a completed fetch manifest and delivered by the information transport component into the designated work areas. Alternatively a standard information transport component user interface can be used to provide this function in a less integrated form.

Multimedia product catalogs with 800 ordering numbers are now available on CD ROM and also with pre installed software packages on new computer hard disks. In this example the multimedia or text and graphic product catalog is a read only information product which can be furnished with an information transport component according to the invention to facilitate order placement from such electronic product catalogs providing an easier order placing process than has heretofore been possible. Employing the inventive information transport component a catalog vendor can enable a customer to place the order directly via modern without requiring a voice call and ensuing verbal product identification by pointing and clicking a Place Order or Mark for Order button on the user s computer screen. The order is transported to remote server using the novel information transport component . Preferably a verification routine is included requiring order confirmation with a user supplied password and possibly keying of the total amount to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent product ordering for example by children.

Order fulfillment is effected by processing of the information in due course after receipt by the remote server and any additional information required centrally is collected during product setup and held locally for transmission with an order. For example setup can capture the user s charge card information shipping address and the like and create a header for an electronic order form.

When the user clicks the Mark Order button procedures supplied with the user interface as modified through user interface API add order item identification information to an electronic order form. When the user clicks the Place Order button user interface triggers a transport request to server to include the order form as a send information object . Transport of the send object including the order form from the user s station to the server is executed employing an object manifest as described herein.

If not located at a vendor s or merchant s premises server can forward received electronic orders to the merchant for fulfillment at appropriate intervals via a vendor link .

This simple low cost mechanism for automated order placement can complement telephone ordering but lacks the credit checking and inventory status capabilities that are frequently provided by phone. However such a catalog application could allow the user to request the fetching of an inventory and price update object for use prior to the preparation of an order.

A powerful electronic merchandising tool can be provided by providing the user with a full function order generating capability and employing transporter to transmit a user created merchandise order effortlessly and seamlessly to a remote order processing server. To this end server should be interfaced to the necessary merchant processing services for checking and reporting credit and inventory status.

An additional valuable option enables the system to apply pre specified user instructions previously obtained through user interface to determine whether out of stock items are to be dropped back ordered or substituted in color or other aspect. This information can be added to the electronic order form object listed in object manifest and become the subject of a further transport dialog between the user s station and server . In this manner a sophisticated purchase transaction is completed in a substantially unattended manner save for deciding about back orders off line in as much as the customer does not have to maintain a phone conversation while fully achieving the capabilities of telephone order placement. A further user benefit can be obtained by the providing a permanent record of the transaction a stored electronic file without user intervention. This not possible with telephone ordering.

This novel automated modern driven order placement system effectively shields a merchant from having to deal with the problems of establishing communications with a mass of unknown end user computer systems while automating the process and relieving the merchant of the costs of telephone sales staff. This aspect of the invention is valuable in avoiding troublesome support intensive communications which are subject to rapid technical change as new products are absorbed into the marketplace. In contrast the merchant s special purpose vendor link to the server can remain relatively stable while the customer interface at server depending upon the sophistication and universality of the API s and and also upon any emergent communications standards can be adapted to accommodate a range of future products.

As discussed in the BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION hereinabove some vendors for example Microsoft Corporation distribute information products in locked inaccessible form accompanied by user accessible promotional information and demo versions. The prospective purchaser then calls an 800 number to order the product and is given a code which is entered to unlock the item for use. The inventive information transport component and cooperative server component can be used to simplify this process and eliminate the voice call.

The information transport component is used to place the order and as a subsequent step concomitant with satisfaction of the merchants purchase requirements payment etc can employing a suitable line entry or entries in the object manifest fetch the access code as an information object in the same way as an order acknowledgment or other information update. The user interface and data management components of the distribution CD or original information product can be programmed automatically to use the code to unlock the product.

Employing the novel digital modem enabled communications products of the invention more sophisticated access codes than are suitable for verbalizing to a caller can be used and may include small programs or decompression utilities although these would better be stored in the locked product or customer specific coding employing user derived information. Thus as a safeguard against fraud being equipped with specific user or user product information the access code can be a key or product uniquely matched to the user s locked product copy.

Computer Software Updates For distribution of updates to software products the original distribution version of the software product can provide registered users with an appropriate ID code and update schedule. Should the revision be delayed a revised schedule can be fetched.

Tax or other governmental filings and exchanges An example of the generality of the inventive information transport system for sending and fetching well defined information objects of many kinds is in the filing of tax returns. A send information object can be created and manifested to submit electronic tax filings to the IRS as described above for electronic product order forms. A fetch object can be created to obtain updated tax forms and the program logic relating to them and to get information on new regulations. Analogous uses will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts of for example financial planning and portfolio management systems to obtain current statistics place orders and the like.

In a modified embodiment the inventive information transport component is integrated with a general purpose user interface database search UI DB software package and tools. Such packages and tools sometimes referred to as authoring packages are now used to produce CD ROM s and similar information products. Thus a single UI DB product may contain the inventive information transport component and be supplied to publishers to be used to develop a family or diversity of information products as a standard tool box.

A combination of the inventive information transporter product with such UI DB products could facilitate development of applications by allowing much of the work of integrating a containing product s user interface and database functions and which could be controlled through the UT DB product with the inventive information transport component to be performed once in advance by a UI DB software vendor s skilled specialists for use in a diverse range of products using that vendor s software. Such integrated offering would be advantageous to both the software vendor by enriching its offering and to the software vendor s publisher customers by facilitating the desired function.

In a valuable application of the novel electronic information transport products of the invention remote server can be operated to provide an electronic data product distribution service for multiple containing information products each equipped with an information transport component the whole facility providing a complete network distribution service including network technical and end user support. Provision of such a distribution service is greatly facilitated by the novel transporter described herein the use of which for each vended product greatly simplifies the problems of handling updates to multiple products. However such a novel service could also be operated with conventional software communications products by relying upon users of each to execute an appropriate sequence of menu selection and command line instructions to obtain an update by modem via their own pre existing communications software. Similarly While special advantages of seamless user adoption and integration into an original product accrue from the use of the inventive transporter to distribute product updates such a distribution service can be used with advantage to distribute any type of electronic information product.

For many publishers and for providers of UI DB authoring software the task of operating a publicly available server and of supplying associated technical support to a wide base of customers using a diversity of communications products even with the simplification benefits provided by the inventive transport product is a task requiring specialized skills and staffing that a publisher even one experienced in electronic publishing will generally lack. Such a specialist capability is intimidating to provide and difficult to cost justify for the limited number of information products that one publisher can supply.

By providing a new turnkey service or service bureau a specializing skilled vendor would enable the publisher to avoid such burden. A provider of such a novel service can spread the costs of such operational activities and skilled staff across a large number of publishers and information products achieving economies of scale and specialization.

The inventive information transport products extend to software implemented at server or at one or more clients or satellite servers of a network served by server to provide the server location functions of such an electronic product distribution service. Such distribution software can be separately marketed to publishers or UI DB vendors who wish to operate such a service.

Example 4 above shows how information transporter as well as server can remain simple yet provide a highly general and extensible service. In that example server provides the functionality of a general purpose transaction gateway or interface to an external function processor. In this particular case the external function processor gatewayed by server via vendor link is the merchant s order processing system which receives the order determines its disposition and responds with order status information which is relayed back to server for return to the customer as a response object in accord with protocols and . The user need not be aware of such complexities nor do the client transport components of the inventive product need to be aware of or provide information for remote routing via vendor link . Only the server needs this information and server needs only to know that send objects with names that fall within a specified class for a specified product ID must be forwarded to a specified external processor and that the corresponding responses from that processor must be routed back to an originating client as response objects. Thus the inventive information transport component by virtue of its simplicity has general applicability and many uses as described herein and as will further be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In implementing an ordering service using the inventive information transport component order and response objects are preferably formatted by the containing information product to be consistent with existing or future electronic data interchange EDI standards which define protocols and formats for data interchange between customers and vendors. The information transport component and the server protocol provide the low level EDI transport functions and are independent of object content defined by higher layers of the EDI protocol. Preferably the server has added routing layer information to move objects to and from the external processor.

To provide a suitable EDI compatible function server can be programmed with such higher layer EDI routing data for its exchanges with the merchant s external processor. Employing such a gatewayed system a single EDI network connection can be used to connect the server to a large number of different merchant processors anywhere in the world across wide area networks and links between same for example Internet.

This concept of an open server providing a gatewayed pathway for information objects to travel between a wide base of users and one or more remote vendors or other object sources is greatly facilitated or enabled by employment of the inventive transporter which effectively provides a protocol translation function enabling a simple information transport service to be offered which is easy and economical to use both for the end user and the vendor or information supplier. Such a transport service compares favorably for its intended information transport purposes with broader function and more complex of full online services such as COMPUSERVE trademark and the like described hereinabove.

Receipt of broadcast data As an alternative to modem based wireline or wireless calling to a server and requesting data objects the information transporter system of this invention can be beneficially employed in a broadcast information distribution system wherein data information objects are contained within a broadcast data stream with recipient communications devices tuned to identify and receive from the broadcast specific data elements to which they are entitled. On the Internet such broadcasting to a selected group of recipients is called multicasting. 

Broadcasting can be airwave broadcasting via satellite FM or TV subchannels in the manner for example used by Mainstream Data Ltd. for the broadcast of news wires. Alternatively the broadcast data stream may be cable or line transmitted for example over cable television systems. Minor extensions to API s and could accommodate such a facility. A modified setup function could alert a uses receiving communications device to watch for receipt of data objects identified as relating to the original or containing information product and to capture and hold identified objects in temporary storage. A schedule transport function can then be set to fetch the received data objects from temporary storage and prepare them for use.

Subscription delivery Although the invention has been described as being particularly applicable to the solution of problems arising in distributing updates of original or previously purchased or delivered electronic information products those skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the benefits of the invention can be obtained without any initial information content being delivered to the user with the original product. The user could simply receive the information transporter and all product information could be received subsequently after installing the information transporter in the form of fetch objects transmitted from a remote server or other suitable source. For example a newsletter service could provide a disk with the transporter and a user interface but with no initial information content. As the transporter operating at the user stations automatically fetches new issues according to the newsletter schedule the information is in effect pushed down a channel from the distribution server for delivery to the base of subscribing users.

Information on demand services In another embodiment providing an information product on demand service vendors can freely distribute a novel electronic marketing product comprising a transporter on diskette along with a simple user interface and a catalog of information product items available from the vendor without including the products themselves. Such an electronic marketing product could be distributed through the mail as a magazine insert giveaway or through any other suitable marketing medium. The transporter could be activated at any time by the to call in and fetch a cataloged product as well as a current catalog possibly after sending a credit card order form or the product price could be paid to the vendor by obtaining the product from a 900 number providing vendor reimbursement from the telephone network.

In a further aspect the invention provides an information transport component that functions as universal or generic client interface software enabling a user client to work with any one or more of many online server based information distribution services.

Many online information distribution services used to disseminate electronic publications comprise intelligent user interfaces which employ a client component running on a customer s personal computer PC to communicate with a central server facility operated by the online service by means of a proprietary protocol. The client interface packages are proprietary to a particular online service.

Prospective publishers wishing to offer electronic products online contract with online service providers to enable customers to use the online service s client software to access the publisher s material and related online communications services bulletin boards etc. on the services servers. The publisher is limited to using the presentation facilities provided by the user interface in the online service s client software. This limitation impedes migration of publisher offerings and makes it difficult for either a customer or a publisher to swing information transport component access from one service provider to another because each service requires its own software package.

Third party interface developers cannot contribute to such online interfaces for a publisher without the cooperation of the online service provider which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Accordingly only limited user interfaces with moderate sophistication and variety can be offered.

Accordingly in another aspect to provide open architecture online service communication the inventive information transport component can be embodied as a flexible client interface which can be actuated to operate with any one of a number of online services by providing a generic client interface foundation API application program interface combined with a set of translators and protocol drivers capable of communicating the user s functional requests to any one of a set of online services using their corresponding proprietary protocols.

In this aspect the invention permits publishers to develop highly sophisticated and individualized user interfaces independently of the limitations of the online service providers capabilities. Such enhanced user interfaces are attractive to publishers seeking differentiation of their products by providing an appealing individualized interface with a signature look and feel. In contrast online service providers seeking to economically carry content from many publishers provide generic interfaces acceptable to all.

By incorporating operational translators for a number of online service protocols which translators fully adhere to the detailed specifications of each protocol a multi service capability can be provided.

Online services generally provide similar types of services with nearly standard functions and similar user interfaces. Major service types include bulletin board chat electronic mail document browsing and database search. Use of creative typography layout graphics and other artistic elements to offer the presentation quality and variety typical of print media is desired by publishers using this medium.

The invention facilitates this end by providing open development platforms for development of advanced interfaces while shielding developers from the complex details of communication with an online server. The shielding is accomplished by providing an API which supports communications service requests at a simple functional request level.

Referring to multiple targeted online services can be accessed by a client interface comprising any of multiple graphical user interfaces driving a generic API which works with plug in translator communicator modules which are provided to communicate one to each targeted online service . Modules mimic the online service s protocols so as to be essentially indistinguishable from the proprietary interfaces normally used. A communications manager receives input from API and outputs through protocol mapper which selects the appropriate protocol.

In this embodiment for use with full function online services the functions of API and protocol are extended to support extended open ended interactive sessions and the more varied client server interaction needs of session oriented interactive online applications such as bulletin board posting and browsing online chat electronic mail database and menu browsing and database search.

Similarly in the aspect shown in the invention can be provided with the same kind of additional flexibility with regard to the user s connection to server as the invention can provide for more basic fetch and send functions. While the inventive client server protocol and is particularly suited to the functions described other existing or future services and corresponding protocols could be used if necessary with adaptation to provide workable services for use in conjunction with transport component . Such use may require modification of communications module and protocol by the addition of a protocol mapper and appropriate server protocol plug in to communicate to an alternative server.

In either case such added flexibility in use of the inventive product increases a publisher s choices in selecting server and network facilities through which to distribute information products and enables the publisher to offer fully customized user interfaces for use with multiple or any one of multiple server and network services which do not provide for such customization. In this embodiment of the inventive transport component a containing product can offer a unique custom interface and provide for access to additional information products from such varied source facilities as the Internet full function online services emerging groupware network services conventional bulletin board systems and future network services using wireless or cable television technology.

While the invention can provide a flexible generic API in some circumstances an existing third party API designed for use with a single specific online service can be combined with an embedded transporter and server protocol mapper to allow products designed to use the third party API to employ any of multiple servers for distribution avoiding commercial distribution restraints associated with that API for example use of a particular server.

The inventive protocol mapper can insulate a containing information product from the variations among such services and can allow a single such information product to be transported through a variety of such services and to later be moved to other such services by simply selecting an alternative protocol mapper. Multiple such protocol mappers can be packaged within a given information product to permit alternatives to be selected by the end user from a list. Thus the invention further permits information products and related UI DB authoring tools to be service independent and neutral.

Enhancements can enable a publisher s service to provide integrated seamless access to content distributed over several different online services to seamlessly combine access to both online and local CD ROM based content and to coexist with and share resources with other publishers services on the user s PC.

In summary the invention provides in this aspect a simple easy to use multi protocol capability that enables an electronic information object to be transported from a publisher to a wide base of users by any one of a number of online services without sacrificing individual product identity.

Another application of the inventive information transport product or transporter is a recursive use to update itself in the same manner that the transporter can update a containing information product. This method can be useful in a variety of ways including to upgrade the transporter by the addition of new protocol components new compression techniques or new network access methods.

An important class of such self updates is to provide added flexibility in specifying network access procedures. For example the user setup routine could be extended into a two stage process. In a first stage each user s transporter calls in to a common pre set phone number in order to fetch a second phone number selected according to the user s particular product location or some other parameter. The second phone number or other address can then placed in the setup as an update to be used in subsequent transport operations.

This two stage method can provide efficient use of a single pre set toll free 800 number for an initial call from any number of different products which initial call yields a second number corresponding to a specific Product ID which number is used for subsequent calls.

In an advantageous embodiment the second number is not toll free and may include vendor charges in the manner of a 900 number. This arrangement enables a system in which users do not pay for initial setup calls and any failed connections which might result from initial setup problems but do pay long distance toll charges and per call vendor fees if the publisher so desires for subsequent product information transport from the second number. This two number process can be carried out without requiring any phone number entry or selection by the user. Additionally the second number can readily be changed whenever desired by the publisher even after product discs have been shipped.

References herein to a user s station workstation computer or terminal will be understood to embrace any information appliance or intelligent device having the basic computer like functions of programmed logic storage and presentation or having the ability to support an operating system for managing user input output with a processor including intelligent cable television controllers video game players information kiosks wired and wireless personal communicators and even system controllers such as automotive computers.

Employing the novel information transport component interacting with remote server through communications protocols and the invention enables the following advantageous objectives and other benefits to be achieved 

The preferred use of an object manifest in a transport control mechanism which includes transporting the object manifest between client user and server and referencing the object manifest by user fetch send protocol and server fetch send protocol facilitates achievement of the following additional objectives 

The invention thus provides an information transport software component which can be employed to transport a wide variety of data objects or applications and can be easily incorporated in many different information products to provide multiple novel containing information products with built in automated updatability or upgradability executable at an appropriate time by simple user menu selection or automatically.

In addition to the benefits of a powerful and efficient information transport method use of a standard formalized transporter its API and client server protocol pursuant to the teachings of the invention disclosed herein can provide any or all of the following significant benefits to users information product vendors application vendors service providers tool vendors or others 

Stated succinctly by having the novel information transport component rely entirely on a containing information product for all user interface and information presentation functions there need be no restrictions on the creativity of the containing product imposed by the needs of a third party communications product. Thus the containing information product can present transport functions with any desired look and feel.

Another advantage of the information transport system of the invention is the avoidance of difficult or complex navigation tasks and the use of simple direct dial communications which are suitable for sessions that are short and infrequent. The inventive information transport products described herein are consistent with or readily adaptable to the needs of many publishers of a diversity of materials which needs are commonly centered on discrete products and content.

A further advantage of the invention from the point of view of publishers is that because the call is customer initiated the customer pays transport costs telephone line charges simplifying costing for the publisher who avoids having to figure shipment or other transportation costs before sale and build these costs into the price of the product or update.

The inventive approach to mass distribution of electronic information products described herein can also provide advantages in high value environments such as those of Counterpoint Publishing s Federal Register products cited hereinabove providing a more seamless integration of the fetching of updates received via modem and selected and extracted by the user from the Daily Federal Register with the original product on CD ROM the CD Federal Register . Product installation can be simplified and a separate user invocation of and interface to a general purpose communications package can be avoided. In addition by employing the user s pre existing modem and avoiding need for a general purpose communications product license significant cost savings can be obtained.

The better to comprehend its possible applications and enhancements embodiments of the invention can be grouped in four levels as a follows.

Level Zero A novel basic transport function embeddable in any of a range of electronic information products to provide economical unattended updates.

Level One Basic transporter incorporating API s and adds a powerful new capability to be used with an electronic information product s custom user interface optionally enhanced with a database management facility for seamless integration of an update with an original product.

Level One Server enhanced Adds server operation and user support features enabling publishers to outsource tasks which may be difficult or unfamiliar to them.

Level Two Adds optional translation or use of alternative server protocols enabling an embeddable transporter product to work with many different servers or services including for example standard BBS s Internet servers and special transport services such as those offered or proposed by communications providers such as AT T MCI Compuserve America Online and cable television systems.

Level Three Adds a full online service user interface API with correspondingly enhanced client server protocols to provide for full function online service sessions with user interface control ability to work with a range of online services providing a publisher with flexibility in their use of existing and emerging services.

These four levels of the invention are illustrated schematically in . Referring to depicting a basic Level embodiment user employs generic onscreen interface to initiate an update request from a remote source not shown for an update object . After initiation for example by clicking on a button in generic interface communication with the remote server and retrieval of the update object can proceed automatically as described herein. Alternatively although not shown similar means could support submission of a send object to the remote server both at the basic level and in the cases of Levels .

In the Level embodiment shown in incorporation of APIs and in or with transporter enables the containing information product s user interface to be supplemented with object transportation functions. Also shown is a received update object seamlessly integrated with information product using a database management module not shown as described in the parent application.

When the Level embodiment is enhanced with a database management module or with an authoring package a particularly valuable embodiment results which may be described as a UI DB package enhanced Level . In many possible applications product may not be created by original programming from scratch but may be created by employing a standard software package which is then customized to integrate the desired publisher s information content with a standard software package or toolkit that provides the MB functions. Such a UI DB package or toolkit can use APIs and to provide a point of linkage to the transporter .

A programmer developer or other software provider is thus by such an enhanced Level embodiment to offer a software package which can easily be utilized by many different publishers to add whatever content they desire and gain the advantages of automated or managed information object transport as described herein while avoiding any need for the publisher to address the tedious and perhaps difficult mechanics of the transport operation.

The software provider can use the inventive transporter as an optional element or include it as part of his enabling product thus offering added value to the publisher. In doing so the software provider can if desired set up a standard or readily customizable set of UI DB elements to support the desired transporter functions and provide all corresponding interfaces to APIs and thus relieving the publisher of the need directly to interface to the transporter via its APIs. Such an approach of integrating the inventive transporter with amore general UI DB authoring package can also be used to include the inventive transporter component into a more broadly functional offering to publishers for the more advanced embodiments of Levels and . It will be apparent that if a third party authoring package offers an API or system developer s interface for use with its product the integration of the transporter with such package may be best accomplished by creating a special and novel interface module which links between that existing UI DB package s API and the transporter APIs and . Such an API interface module comprises an element of the invention.

The server enhanced Level embodiment depicted schematically in shows how operation of a server and technical support functions can be off loaded by an electronic publisher to a server operator . Electronic publisher can distribute an information product which may be complete with content or may be merely an enabling shell directly to users by whatever means is appropriate including distribution on physical media and electronic downloading. Updates are then furnished to server operator to complete distribution of updates to appropriate users. As will be apparent updates may embrace essentially any desired information or content including original content intended to fill a previously distributed shell.

As shown transporter can be contained in each of a number of information products distributed by one or more publishers to one or more sets of customers. Multiple information products can be updated from a single server or a server may be dedicated to each individual product . The electronic publisher is thus relieved of the expense of replicating and distributing updates or of the technical challenges of maintaining their own distribution server .

If desired integration between a fetched object and original information product content can be effected by a separable content integration module for seamless viewing or processing by the user of combined local and remote content. The integration module can comprise the user interface and database integration tools and may or may not contain the transporter . Such an integration module with or without the transporter may subject to customization to meet the purposes of the invention be obtainable from third parties.

The Level embodiment depicted in illustrates how the invention enables great communications flexibility to be easily included into their products by publishers or producers and in turn put in the hands of even novice users simply by equipping transporter with multiple protocols enabling the user automatically to access any one of multiple servers or other remote communications facilities by including multiple protocol plug ins as illustrated in and described in the parent application page 78 line 12 . Illustrated by way of example are an Internet server or Internet point of presence through which all or any server on the Internet may be accessed a BBS server or bulletin board server for access to low cost direct dial servers and a third route to any other desired remote communications equipped server which may include commercial online services is also shown. By channeling communications and remote data retrieval to the user via the containing information product a seamless presentation through the information product s distinctive user interface can be made. For example a stock management product could access one remote server to update prices of the users stocks and a bulletin board to obtain current news items of the company whose stock has been updated.

In another application of this Level embodiment depicted in transporter includes multiple client server protocols enabling it to access any one of several online servers I J and K. This embodiment enables a publisher to distribute product and permit the user to update or supplement it via whichever online service they happen to use or subscribe to thereby enabling a publisher to economize on the server function by using an established online service yet reach the widest possible electronic consumer base by reaching users through any one of multiple services e.g. CompuServe America Online Prodigy Microsoft Network or other proprietary online service or Internet access provider each of which may have limited accessibility determined by market scope geography or technology or the like.

The inventive transporter enables the publisher to accomplish this with a single uniform interface to APIs and and thus without need to implement costly program interfaces specific to each online service. As described in the parent application a preferred embodiment of the protocol plug in maps the APIs and to any suitable pre existing API available for use with a target online service such as is offered by CompuServe for connection to its online service or for use with an Internet server. Alternatively a converse translation could be effected APIs and could be overlaid by a layer that simulates a pre existing protocol used by a containing product to communicate with a single online service I thus allowing it to be retargeted to other online services J or K or other servers without significant program change to the containing product. 

The Level embodiment as described in the parent application can also be depicted using where in this case the connection protocols are enhanced to support full continuing online session functions such as browsing search and chat.

Level enables a user to retrieve remote information objects such as information product content or software updates or send in information objects such as product registrations or orders or inquiries in an automatic unattended manner after initiating the communications process with for example a single mouse click.

Level by providing suitable API functionality enables automated object retrieval and send functions to be integrated into the information product s own interface a significant user and marketing advantage. Level UI DB Package Enhanced integrates with authoring packages to simplify the information product producer s task even further. Level Server Enhanced by including server functionality provides a complete service for a publisher.

Level enables information objects to be fetched or retrieved or to be furnished from pre existing commercial services with which the user may already have established communication channels for example by subscription and enables a publisher to reach most or many users via a small number of pre existing commercial online services. In addition Level enables a user to integrate local content available from the user s local physical media hard drive or optical disk for example or locally created content with online content drawn from online sources or the Internet.

Level enhancements of transporter and especially of APIs and can permit tight knit seamless integration of appropriate content in fully online modes giving the user an open ended feeling of continuity between their own local resources and retrieved remote content. This facility is of particular value for sophisticated multimedia applications which may require content from multiple sources to be assembled into a coherent work such as a television commercial a training video or mini movie using moving video frames text content voice photographs special effects and so on for highly interactive processes such as extended free flowing browsing and searching of relatively unbounded network content and where dynamic contributions or interactions among multiple participants are to be accommodated as in conferencing or real time gaming applications involving interactions between multiple network users.

The invention described in the parent application addresses inter dirt the problems of moving digital information objects across a telephone network between a remote source and a disparate body of users and provides a transporter which simplifies and automates transport enabling even novice users to exchange pre specified objects with a remote source via the telephone network using modems or equivalents. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that unlike a local area network LAN a telephone network the phone numbers of which may be regarded as network node addresses nevertheless lacks a distributed file management system for simple transport of files between nodes. Functions such as verification of safe receipt of information objects are readily effected on a local area network for example by executing a directory listing of a remote node address and much more sophisticated transport management capabilities can and are readily provided by network operating systems network utilities network management applications and so on.

A fully functional distributed file management service such as is provided by a local area network sometimes called a distributed I O service I O being an abbreviation for input output permits remote files to be manipulated and accessed via the user station s operating system s normal file I O read write and move copy commands much as if the file were on a locally attached device once appropriate access permissions have been enabled without the complicating need for special supplementary remote file access protocols such as File Transfer Protocol FTP . As explained in the parent application LANs impose burdens including significant initial costs and setup requirements homogeneity and complexity at the nodes login difficulties and so on which problems are not shared by the ubiquitous telephone network to which anyone may successfully connect with a diversity of computer and modem or equivalent equipment.

It will be apparent that the benefits of the invention are obtainable when using other mass market communications networks equivalent to a traditional telephone network which equivalent networks lack basic file management capabilities. Some such equivalent networks which may or may not include file management capabilities and which may be deployed over telephone network hardware or interface therewith include ISDN ATM and ASDL as well as off air services such as cellular or CPCD and as well as cable television networks for which computer connectivity is emerging in 1996 as foreshadowed in the parent application . Such various networks will usually require their own interface device for example an ISDN board or a cable modem which for the purposes of the present invention and to the extent that they are deployed on networks with a lack of distributed file management services or where such services cannot be relied upon to be available to any given user whenever needed will be equivalents of ordinary telephone modems. The Internet as well as proprietary online services or other wide area data networks especially public networks such as those using the X.25 standard as referenced in the parent application also generally lack distributed file management services. References herein to direct dial up communication and telephone network are intended to include such equivalent networks lacking distributed file management services including the Internet and references to a modem include such equivalent network interface devices.

The invention can provide an information product with multipath hybrid access to a remote source enabling a user of the product to receive updates from or otherwise communicate with a remote source. Pursuant to such a preferred embodiment an electronic publisher or other vendor can combine on a consistent basis in a single product automated online access to the Internet or other data network with or without file management capabilities with dial up access to enable a user to connect with the publisher s server via whichever online service the user already employs for Internet access or else via direct dial up access to the publisher s server in the event that the user is not a subscriber to one of the online services for which a protocol is provided. The access path can either be user selected or may be automatically software selected according to what installed modules are found on the user s computer.

This embodiment is valuable for publishers desiring to reach a mass market of computer users with a product that is readily updated in the most practical way. As at early 1996 in spite of the immense publicity received by the Internet the majority of modem equipped computer users do not have Internet access nor do a large percentage use any other online service except where the context indicates that the specific ordinary meaning is intended. This is particularly true of home and small business computer users who constitute a desirable market for many publishers.

Internet access is relatively complex for an inexperienced computer user to set up and usually requires commitment to a monthly subscription yet once set up it is easy to use. The multipath hybrid access embodiment of the invention has the advantage of enabling those users who have Internet access to enjoy the functionality speed and economy of a network path via the Internet while other users a vast market can simply use dial up access via the telephone network they are not required to go to the trouble and expense of establishing an Internet or online service capability. Some users may employ multipath access capabilities to use different access paths according to circumstance for example using a network access path from the home or office and direct dial up on the road where their proprietary online service or other network access route may not be available.

Since the Internet is not expected to reach the majority of such other users for some years this embodiment is particularly advantageous for publishers desiring to reach a mass market. Products that automate communications via an online service yet omit dial up capabilities will exclude a large number of prospective customers. Technically no special effort need be made to provide Internet access to users who do not have the capability it is simply used if present on the user s computer. However the addition of a facility to set up a new Internet or online service subscriptions in a further expanded embodiment of the invention will be valuable to some users. Components for such new user set up are commercially available for example from Internet software and service vendors and can be combined with suitable elements of the inventive transporter component to give the user added options.

Although at the date of this application the Internet is such a dominant world wide communications force it is hard to contemplate alternatives networks they may arise and indeed local organizational equivalents embodying some of the advantages of the Internet s standardization and hypertext capabilities are emerging and have been dubbed intranets . Equally comparable or competitive wide area networks based on substantial new or existing infrastructure may emerge. Cable television networks might provide such an infrastructure base. In most cases relevant aspects of the invention as described herein in connection with the Internet will also be applicable to such alternative networks and intranets to an extent that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As described above under the heading Equivalent Networks like telephone like switched point to point networks unlike local area networks supported by a homogenous network operating system maintaining a shell at every node more heterogenous data networks such as intranets and the Internet do not generally support and provide full distributed file management systems enabling digitized files to be manipulated in the same way as local files although they generally provide for more limited services using protocols such as FTP or HTTP hypertext transport protocol which permit files to be copied from one node to another with one or a few simple command line instructions. However block transfer for example to read one or more records from a database file are either not or not readily accomplished. Nor can a remote program be executed.

Referring to their Internet origins and choosing to characterize them by important features of the World Wide Web though other features might be used the intranets and Internet like networks described in the preceding paragraph can be termed webbed data networks and are notable for having multiple remote data servers supporting hyperlinked data resources. Such webbed data networks achieve much of their utility from employing a standardized object preparation language e.g. HTML and a standardized file transfer or access protocol for platform independent transport and utilization of objects on the network.

Unless a different meaning is clearly required by the context the term web is used herein to connote an array of hyperlinked information objects stored at one or many locations on a network.

As described in the parent application the inventive transporter component can be advantageously used to facilitate transport of information objects across the Internet to and from containing information products by automating access to the Internet and to a predetermined Internet site or resource. It can also be used for transport across other network facilities including direct dial and many different user interfaces and content formats can be accommodated. It will be apparent from that disclosure that one such particularly useful embodiment of the containing information product is that of a web browser as a UI DB package which can incorporate transport component to provide an alternative dial up route of access to Internet servers that also support dial up access via a telephone or equivalent network or whenever use of the transporter s short burst mode of closed loop communication session is desirable. Similarly such access can be provided indirectly via a separate dial up server which contains or has access to the content which is also accessible via a Web server or equivalent content.

Some known web browsers are discussed in Rick Ayre et al. Web Browsers Vol. 14 No. 3 Feb. 7 1995 pages 173 at seq. As reported at page 175 column 1 web browsers can be embodied as operating system components for example OS 2 Warp trademark IBM and Microsoft s Windows 95 trademark . As operating system software expands and assimilates what were once free standing or separately marketed software utilities for example memory managers disk compression utilities and backup programs distinctions between what is operating system software or a utility or small application become more commercial or market based than technical. Similarly communications services provided by Web browsers such as HTTP protocol access and other similar Internet tools such as for FTP protocol access could also be useful as software facilities on which to build transporter protocol plug ins and it will be apparent that use of any such available software components is contemplated by the invention for example as comprehended in the discussion of protocol plug ins in the parent application.

Internet sites using the World Wide Web Web sites present their resources via what are called Web pages including top level pages called home pages and a linked network of other Web pages. Web pages may be accessed and viewed with a Web browser program which provides standard graphical user interface and data presentation functions to apply format controls coded into the Web page using a standard format to enable a visitor to the site to browse the site s resources via textual and graphic information drop down contents and catalog lists and via search windows with varying degrees of functionality.

Keys to the explosive growth of the Web are the use of standardized communications protocols HTTP hypertext transport protocol and data content and formatting coding language e.g. hypertext markup language HTML to effect real time transfer of interactive images Web pages and related content or services across the Internet using digital packet addressing. Sponsors or suppliers of Web material can use their Web pages as an interface to provide substantially any desired content.

In early 1996 today s format is HTML which is a currently popular embodiment of Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML a complex standard adherence to which provides the widespread readability of Internet documents. HTML provides a format to describe the design of a document and its connection to other documents accessible via the Internet using hypertext links or hyperlinks . Alternative content formats such as Adobe s ACROBAT trademark provide similar formatting for use with a suitably augmented browser and other such formats may emerge and evolve. Adobe s ACROBAT is an example of an authoring system or application which creates information objects that are integrated with their own display or utilization applets mini applications or tools for platform independent viewing or playing of the objects.

Typically Web pages contain both internal hyperlinks to site features and external hyperlinks to other sites and they may also permit activation or downloading of sound multimedia or other more sophisticated content. Such hypertext links or hyperlinks provide immediate initiation of a connection to an information resource for retrieval of an image in response to a mouse click or two. Hypertext links use uniform resource locators known by the acronym URL to find resources on the Internet. The URL identifies the location of a file on an Internet server by a server address such as http www.uspto.gov and a more or less extended directory path to a filename for a specific page or tag within a page if it is a Web site or other data source.

Many thousands of commercial organizations use the Web for publishing for customer service for distributing product information via catalogs and the like and for online sales. Content varies from a few simple text paragraphs to large and complex data suites providing multimedia presentations games or other entertainments with audio video and animation. New uses of the Web and methods of doing business are continually being invented.

A Web browser is an application running at the user s station which can access search engines find and retrieve Web pages using URLs and assemble the retrieved elements of text graphics sound and video if present into a coherent printable document or playable presentation. Typically a Web browser also provides a variety of tools to make hot lists of the user s preferred sites to effect various file and connection management functions and so on.

Some drawbacks of the Web are that conventional Web access reaches only a small proportion of households with personal computers and modems a 1995 estimate is that only about 21 percent of 27 million households with personal computers had Internet access that such access is generally available only by continuing subscription through an access provider service by paying a minimum monthly fee that connection time can be expensive and that Internet access is subject to congestion and interruptions or loss of connection. For a commercial content provider desiring to reach a mass market these are important limitations.

To overcome these and other problems the invention provides an information object distribution system for webbed networks such as the networks described above which system comprises 

In this aspect the invention also provides a computer implemented offline browser system for offline browsing of locally stored Web pages which offline browser system is suitable for distribution to a mass market of users or to a small group and for operation at a local computer station and which comprises 

Such offline browsing in which hyperlinks may be actively pursued may be termed active offline browsing to distinguish from mere passive viewing of the content or web pages wherein hyperlinks are either non responsive or yield errors.

At least some if not all of the local content elements are accessed from a Web page loaded by the local Web browser via active screen elements such as hyperlinks search boxes dialog boxes selection buttons and the like. If the local Web page is a carbon copy of a Web site page then some or all of these active screen elements will use URLs to locate desired content elements and these URLs may point to Internet addresses such as the originating sewer rather than to local storage at the local station preventing the browser from operating in the desired offline mode.

To solve this problem the invention also provides a link manager and relocator function to adjust the hyperlink coding as needed to enable the Web browser to retrieve Web page content elements from local storage. The link manager can be either static or dynamic. A static link manager can be embodied in preprocessed Web pages or content as a simple rewriting of the original URL to a suitable local path and filename as well if appropriate. Such a static locator device is appropriate for a shipped product supplied on physical storage media and may be appropriate for updates supplied via direct modem to modem connection or equivalent but a dynamic locator is more flexible and can be used for content elements or pages retrieved online from one or more Web sites especially for rapidly changing or complex content and advanced functions such as searching and transaction handling. Such a dynamic locator can work with pre existing URLs as found on the Web site and redirect them on the fly to local resources. Embodiments of the invention may place this link manager relocator at the server or at the client and the static embodiments may be effected by either programmatic or manual procedures as desired.

It will be understood that the above described offline browser is quite distinct from conventional applications including even sophisticated word processors being distinguished inter alia by its ability to work online when necessary to search the Web and retrieve information objects from it employing hypertext links to remote resources and using the Internet s Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocols or equivalents. Preferably the local browser comprises search display and hyperlink capabilities comparable to those provided by a conventional Web browser with adaptations as necessary to enable local browsing of the content at the local station. Such adaptations may include the link manager a local search filter for a Web search engine and modification of an online browser to load and run locally without automatically initiating access to the Internet. In a preferred embodiment the offline browser is developed from a standard online browser product available from any suitable source modified and adapted as necessary to provide the offline mode functionality described herein.

However a very simple offline browser according to the invention may eschew direct Internet online access capability and be designed to work only with locally stored Web pages updates and new content elements being received on physical media or via a dial up connection. Especially if the local browser and station have multimedia capabilities and the local content elements have auto play capabilities such as are provided by Sun Microsystems JAVA trademark language ability of the browser transparently to access multiple resources CD ROM DVD digital video disks hard disk etc. by simply clicking hot button hyperlinks can be employed in various new products. For example a multimedia music product can combine the music with text still pictures or video about the artist and permit locally stored updates to be seamlessly merged with original content.

The new content element can be an update of a local content element and preferably is also locally stored and is transparently accessed and integrated with other local content elements for viewing or processing by the user for which purpose the herein described user interface and database modules are those provided by the offline browser which acts in the role of a containing information product.

Richer products will provide multiple Web pages for offline use and may comprise large numbers of content elements which are updated with or supplemented by multiple new content elements fetched as a package.

Such an offline browser system can be distributed by a commercial sponsor or content provider to simulate their Web site in a standalone environment without the expense difficulty and inconvenience of establishing an Internet subscription connection for those who do not have one. To this end selected Web site content providing one or more pages which may have a customized look chosen by the commercial sponsor local pages hereinafter can be supplied on physical media such as CD ROM or diskette and updates can be automatically fetched by the transporter. The combination of offline browser and local pages may be seen to be another embodiment of the containing information product described in the parent application. The user interface database management and other data integration functions described in the parent application are provided by the browser augmented if necessary in such an offline browser embodiment of the invention.

Of course as described above the offline browser system can be distributed as a shell which uses the transporter to fetch completing elements and content from a remote site via a telephone network or equivalent network. By disconnecting automatically if so desired when the specified information object transport operation or operations has or have been completed the transporter of the invention limits line or access charges. In contrast with conventional online Web browsing time charges continue to accumulate while the user views or processes received material. The transporter can be repeatedly reactivated on an as needed basis to provide intermittent communication with the remote server or servers specified or user entered in its setup protocols thereby simulating the ongoing open ended interactivity of an online connection with the remote server. Naturally the Web site sponsor may choose to modify the local pages as compared with their Web site counterparts for example to simplify them or to provide access to content or function intended by the sponsor for local use only.

The local pages will normally include at least one greeting page introducing the site and providing access to its principal features or categories and may also include many layers of functionality and content which can be jointly or severally updated by transporter operation. Preferably at least one local page pursuant to this aspect of the invention will be distinguished from a conventional Web page by the presence of an update function or hyperlink for activating the transporter to update that page or if desired by the sponsor to update the complete offline browser system. Different update links can employ different object manifests to use the transporter to fetch various content according to the context of the update hyperlink.

In a further embodiment the offline browser system of the invention can be used in a larger context which combines local content stored on CD ROM or equivalent distributable media diskette or DVD for example with additional content from a hard disk or equivalent and with live browsing or data retrieval from a remote source for example a Web site on the Internet via intermittent transporter or data shuttle connections shuttling herein. The inventive offline browser system can combine these resources in a coherent suite.

Thus local Web content can be pre distributed on CD ROM or diskette for use with the described offline browser system. This distributed locally stored Web content can then be combined with more current or additional content obtained from the sponsor s Web site or other remote location by either intermittent shuttling or live continuous browsing. This allows user selection of local intermittent or live modes as desired or as available at any given time and place. Providing such multiple access capabilities enables a vendor or sponsor to distribute their product en masse to computer owners or users with confidence that a large number of prospects can use the product easily and currently. For example diskettes might be given away with a computer magazine to be sure of reaching a market rich in enabled prospects by any vendor willing to make the investment to reach them. A different group are prospective house purchasers a group rich in computer owners and users who could be given an initial diskette or CD ROM containing a realtor s listings and the inventive offline browser system for viewing and updating the listings from a Web site or other remote server using either the Internet or the telephone network. This method enables the prospects to browse the realtor s listings offline at their leisure and to update it easily via either the Internet or the telephone network as needed. The realtor does not have to consider whether their prospect has an Internet access subscription and the prospect does not have to worry about the difficulties and costs of attempting to download extensive listings.

Clearly it is in the interest of both the sponsor and the user for the offline browser to work with current content elements. To obtain the benefits provided by the present invention as it relates to browsing Web content it is desirable for new online content to be retrieved and stored locally so that the network connection used for retrieval may be terminated terminating time charges and browsing can proceed on the local station.

Referring to an offline browser is shown running at a local station where local content is available at any of various storage media removable or fixed such as disk diskette or CD ROM. Calls handled by telephone network and routed to an Internet service provider ISP enable the Internet or equivalent resource rich standardized wide area network to be accessed by offline browser via conventional online connection if such connectivity is available and desired at the local station . A content provider maintains a Web site server connected to the Internet via line as a point of presence on the World Wide Web and additionally a web package server which is in communication with Web site server and is equipped and configured for direct telephone access by users via telephone network and telephone line . Web server supplies web pages to the Internet and selected Web pages or Web page excerpts are supplied to web package server to serve as local pages . Local pages with relevant Web page URLs replaced with appropriate local paths or other local resource locators if desired can be retrieved via dial up connection if conventional Internet access is not available or desired. Clearly an information product s functionality or usability can be substantially enhanced by including with the local Web pages whether supplied over the wire or on physical storage media any applets needed to run them for example Sun Microsystems JAVA trademark applets.

Content provider B can thus supply local station with Web pages either via online Internet connection if the local station has one or via other dial up connection if the local station does not have Internet access facilities. The update can be stored locally and become part of the local content where it is available for offline browsing avoiding the costs delays and possibly access problems associated with online or live browsing. Preferably the local browser provides user selection of local intermittent or live modes as desired at any given time.

It will be understood that connections and are typically alternative uses of a single physical telephone line and that alternatively connection could be any kind of direct Internet or other data network connection. It will also be understood that Web server and web package server are distinguished in their logical embodiments as distinct servers which can be implemented either using distinct hardware and software systems or as logically distinct elements on a single hardware platform. Also preferred embodiments may involve continuous real time connection between the servers and for dynamic access to the Web content or intermittent or even offline file transfer linkage when static access is sufficient.

Sending of information from the user to web package server can be accommodated if desired using the bi directional capabilities of the transporter. In this case files of any type may be sent to the server . Thus specific information objects including features of the offline browser and the associated HTML content such as transmission of data entered into HTML forms can be sent to the web package server using appropriate Internet transaction protocols and associated security and payment functions as desired as depicted by connection ISO. Such a system provides a novel mechanism to support processing of forms included for example in web packages as described hereinbelow that are filled out locally.

In more advanced embodiments the linkage between web package server and Web server can be used bi directionally to provide enhanced real time services such as searching and transaction processing. For example a response to a user s inquiry or purchase or product order from a remote Web site can be received by Web server and relayed by the web package server to be made available to the user via the dial up path . Such an embodiment uses the gateway server function described in the parent application and shown as the vendor link in .

Thus the novel features of providing locally browsable Web pages with replaced URLs if necessary and web package server serviced by Web server as described above enables a content provider or sponsor to provide a valuable new service offline Web page browsing with active hyperlinks.

Employing the user interfaces database managers and API s described hereinabove the web package can be seamlessly integrated with existing local material employing hyperlinks if desired for immediate cross referencing or cross locating of material as between the new and locally pre existing material.

It will be apparent that the UI DB functions described for the novel offline browser could be custom built or assembled from suitable browser component toolkits such as are beginning to appear on the market from such sources as Spyglass and that such offline browser function can be integrated with other application functions as desired. However the wide availability and growing installed base of standard browsers from major vendors such as Netscape and Microsoft makes it preferable to employ such a standard browser. In such an embodiment the offline browser is simply a special case of a standard authoring package as described in the parent application. In many cases off the shelf browsers can be used effectively and even browsers previously installed on a user station for other purposes can be employed by exploiting standard features for extending such products including helper applications plug ins applets and API s.

Briefly such mechanisms allow a standard browser to be used to view content and select links to follow to additional content. In simple embodiments when the link target is locally resident it may be automatically handled by the standard browser when it is not present the link can pursuant to the invention be coded to cause the browser to invoke the transporter as a helper application. This is described more fully in the section below headed Link Management .

Also if desired local pages with local resource locators can be supplied to the Internet for retrieval via online connection for offline browsing for example as an appropriately labeled offline browsing package. This feature may be particularly useful for mobile users and the like for whom Internet service may be available or economic only on an intermittent basis. In this case content can be obtained in efficient bursts when access is available or even on an automated unattended schedule when convenient or low in cost and then stored locally for continuing use offline. Thus the time of usage of online content is effectively decoupled from the time of retrieval of the content.

In contemplating the herein described applications of the invention to Web browsing embodiments those skilled in the art will understand that the inventive approach departs dramatically from conventional concepts of Web browsing architecture. Whereas conventional Web browsers are seen primarily as communications programs which gain strength by using a standardized user interface and data content framework UI DB the inventive approach ignores or when used in conjunction with live or online browsing options downplays the browser s role in communications and uses a browser primarily for its UI DB components relying on the inventive transporter for communications. And whereas session management is open ended and conventionally is left to the human frailties of the user the inventive approach uses the transporter to enable task oriented session management operable in a short burst or bursts to transport pre specified objects whose specification may well be unknown to the user and be embedded in a hyperlink or other software element .

In addition conventionally helper applications API s plug ins and other browser extenders were devised primarily for addition of new content types or enhancement of content whereas the present invention utilizes these tools to enhance communications techniques and enable new communications methods.

It will be understood that short burst access to bundled packages of content shown as using a dial up connection to reach the web package server can just as well use an Internet connection or other suitable network as described above and under the heading Equivalent Networks above and that such embodiments may become increasingly important in the future.

As referenced above a problem that arises when attempting to integrate retrieved new content elements with pre existing local content elements stored locally at the user s station is that in general the URLs associated with any hyperlinks in the new content elements fetched from an online Web site will not correctly point to the user s local resources because in the nature of URL s and particularly absolute URLs as described below they will point to a Web site namely the site from which they were fetched or some other Internet Web sites. This link redirection problem may arise whether or not the content comprises Web pages and is inherent in any updatable material that employs hyperlinks where updates will not necessarily be stored in the same logical volume as the original material.

A simple solution to this problem pursuant to the invention provides for links to be coded as relative URLs which are relative to the source location and contain only relative sub structure detail. The links may thus remain valid if the substructure is relocated to the local station on a consistent parallel basis e.g. if remote pages are within a single directory the relocated link will be interpreted as pointing to the single local directory. Thus those elements of the path and filename s that are recited in the link must be present at the local station they could be installed beforehand in an offline browser setup routine or by updates. Link coding may comprise truncation of the absolute URL to remove elements of the Web site address or other modifications as disclosed and suggested herein or as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

While beneficial in many situations the solution of using relative URLs will not solve the more general problem of offline utilization of links to scattered source materials including remotely stored materials where it may be impractical to maintain the relative structure or where absolute URLs may be employed at the remote source. To solve these problems the invention provides as referenced above a link manager to redirect or rewrite URLs as necessary for local use.

For smooth and efficient integration of the offline Web browser system with online browsing activity it is desirable for the offline browser automatically to access the most up to date version of any particular content element and if it must be retrieved from a remote source to be able to fetch it either via live browsing or by shuttle mode. Preferably the local browser should fetch content from the network only if a local copy is no longer current. This capability requires a mechanism to check time stamps of both network and local copies. More advanced embodiments could use more complex and variable criteria for this decision such as factors for file size type urgency and connection availability as well as relative currency.

To solve these problems the invention provides a dynamic link manager cooperative with the local browser to manage link relocations dynamically as links are activated. In preferred embodiments the link manager can operate efficiently regardless of whether content is retrieved via shuttle or live mode.

A variety of levels of sophistication in link management may be employed in embodying the invention and depending on the functions required link management may be static or dynamic at either the server or the user station or both. Key factors are the dynamics of the content in terms of its frequency of change or addition whether both shuttle and live mode are to be supported and the extent to which a user s local content is allowed to vary.

In maintaining proper linkage a key concept is the idea of working sets of web content. Linked content constitutes a network which is a directed graph. While in general Web content is open and any home page may have links which lead to other links that go throughout the entire Web actual Web sites may be limited or can be artificially limited in the scope of their links. Thus the term working set is used herein to mean a set of linked objects which a user is permitted by a service content or applications provider to reference at a given time. This usage of the term working set is borrowed from the unrelated field of virtual memory management.

If the working set is kept sufficiently small it may be practical to transmit all working set elements that have changed whenever the user requests one or more pages in the set. In this case all pages in the current working set are known to be available locally so that links can be pre coded at the server to point to local copies using relative URLs if they are not already coded in such manner . Then desired explicit links for updates to current content or planned extensions can be coded to cause an intercept and the handling of the intercept is used to invoke the transporter to retrieve the update package for the working set.

More generally where the working set is too large for complete transmission on every update and a scheme for segmentation of the working set into smaller bundles of linked objects called web packages herein which can be obtained from the server individually as needed may be employed. In this case as before links within a web package may remain as simple relative URLs which can be expected to work locally and can be followed by the browser without special consideration but links from one web package to another need to be intercepted and checked to determine whether the destination object is in a Local web package and then proceed accordingly.

Pursuant to the embodiment of the invention depicted in the link manager comprises a link interceptor cooperative with the offline browser to intercept links activated by the offline browser and take temporary control of the browser application thread whenever a link pre coded as not internal to the active web package is encountered. Intercepted links are inspected to determine whether they are calling a resource available locally in another resident web package. If not depending on the mode of access in use at the time control is returned to the browser for resource retrieval via live browse or is given to the transporter to perform a shuffle.

In a generalized embodiment the link interceptor monitors all link requests issued by the browser cooperating with the browser by means of any of a variety of standard or customized mechanisms as described below and acts or passes them according to their destinations. To effect monitoring the link interceptor can operate at a relatively high level plugging to the browser s API assuming it to have one although this may require some customization of the link interceptor to browser .

If the intercepted link is determined to be calling a locally available resource for example because it recites a filename identical with a locally stored file it is passed to a link translator to correct its destination. Control and the translated link are then passed back to the local station s offline browser for completion. Preferably the link manager includes a version comparator which calls a version number time and date stamp or other version indicator from the original URL address on the Internet compares same with corresponding data for the local content and processes the more current version. If necessary the link manager can include a time and date stamp module not shown to label relevant links or link elements as they are received locally.

Preferably also in applying such a scheme the link translator reads from the intercepted link sufficient information to enable lookup and translation. Translation can be effected by appropriate modifications of the URL.

Link control and interception cooperative with the local offline browser can be embodied at various levels and points of control. In a simple case all links except a single class of update link can be pre converted to relative URLs that work without interception. Update links can be coded to cause a standard shuttle update function to be invoked such as by invoking a packaged version of the transporter as a helper application using a coding approach such as described below.

In a more flexible embodiment using the web package segmentation structure web package specific intercepts are provided and coding is applied to the links to cause the browser to transfer control for link relocation purposes when specific intercepts are encountered.

In an alternative embodiment of link manager which requires no inline editing of links or selective intercept control the link interceptor intercepts all HTTP Get URL requests in other words intercepts hypertext transport protocol requests to get a file based on its uniform resource locator address which has been left in its original form and makes a determination based on separately maintained data as to whether the target object is local in which case it passes the Get URL back to the browser to execute as a local relative URL or whether to obtain the target object via remote browsing or via transporter shuttling. Interception can be implemented using browser API functions which are commercially available in various forms including for example DDE OLE and Netscape Communications Inline Plug Ins or through use of proxy server functions preferably modified for local users. Proxy servers are commonly used as intermediary servers that can redirect URL references in order to implement secure fire walls but can also be implemented in simple form to perform a comparable redirection function running as a process on the user s machine cooperatively with the browser.

Conventionally a proxy server provides a standard mechanism that implements an intercept redirect function in the network normally applied to the very different objective of resource hiding for purposes of security outboard from the browser. When use of a proxy server is specified to a browser all Get URL requests are directed first to the proxy server which then looks up the proper routing and redirects the requesting browser to the actual desired URL in a two stage process. Proxy servers are usually separate shared servers performing network control functions for entire groups of users and the desired web package storage and access management could be implemented on a similar shared basis but this activity is typically individual in nature and thus preferably effected at the user s station. Use of a simple proxy server on the user station can be an effective mechanism for link control if appropriately coordinated with any other uses of proxy servers such as for security fire walls.

Alternatively the link interceptor may operate at a much lower level and monitor suitable DOS or other operating system interrupts such as interrupt or filter all browser originating resource calls and process the filtered calls selectively according to destination as described herein. Use of the operating system interrupts in this way may be more difficult to implement but can provide a more universal link interceptor able to work with a variety of browsers.

Link coding is preferably done when the web packages are built unless live browsing is to be supported with full or substantially transparent integration of local and online resources. Links internal to a web package are left as or converted to relative URLs and need no intercept although interception may be used for tracking purposes if desired enabling a user s hits on particular links to be logged and forwarded to a remote source using transporter . Such tracking does not require amendment or rewriting of links.

External links are coded into the web packages before delivery so as to be intercepted and amended or rewritten. The intercept process can be manual if static content builds are used or semi or fully automated and can be varied depending on the dynamics of content structure changes for example as follows 

If live browsing is to be fully integrated then link relocation can be dynamically coded locally as pages are received. Preferably the web package structure is used to simplify tracking so as to have similar capability for dynamic web package definition as described in b above. Alternatively individually accessed pages can be tracked as single page web packages with any associated inline objects and then consolidated whenever the opportunity and necessary information becomes available such as on request or when a web package is received that supersedes the individual page.

In a simplified embodiment of this aspect of the invention designated pages can be retrieved one by one as standard pages with associated inline objects from any server or servers but managed together as a package by the client system at the user s station as a defined web package object group using separately maintained web package specification and control information which can be termed a virtual web package . Such a virtual web package has the benefits described herein namely that it can be supplied by direct dial up using batched managed access in a short burst for subsequent offline use. However a virtual web package will lack the packaging related transmission efficiency of the described real web packages although the need for separate prepackaging or staging of content is also avoided by way of compensatory benefit.

One way of coding a link for interception on an exception basis such as by using a helper application is by modifying the file extension of its relative URL or local file protocol URL although at least in some cases steps may need to be taken to avoid destroying file functionality conferred by program recognized extensions such for example as .BMP .TIF .DXF .DBF .IDX and the like. Simple substitution of an extension would lose the extension info and but may be applicable for pages which can be assumed to be written in HTML.

Thus for example the existing file extension of the URL in the uncoded link whatever it might be could be replaced with a common intercept extension such as .TSH which would cause the coded link call to be intercepted for rewriting when that link were activated by the user. Clearly multiple coded extensions could be devised to serve a variety of purposes including perhaps usage tracking. This extension based coding approach is convenient for simple embodiments in which the intercept mechanism is invoked by a special purpose module or application analogous to though providing different functionality from the commonly available mechanism of a helper application which is typically used to invoke viewers for special file types. The inventive use of a helper application mechanism to manage communications while using the browser for viewing is in some senses a reversal of its conventional use.

To retain extension functionality and support more general absolute URLs a preferred coding practice pursuant to the invention is to append to the coded link after the URL s intercept extension one or more additional legal URL coding characters such as used for tags within pages followed by the original URL with its functional extension. Thus image.bmp could be coded as image.tsh bmp or more generally for http host path image.bmp as linker.tsh http host path image.bmp. The URL coding character would be ignored by the browser but would be accessible to the link manager which can delete the URL coding character and the intercept extension rewrite or amend the URL and return it to the browser for execution with its original extension intact. It will be understood that starting after the initial all and other special characters such as for a real tag must be coded in the form of their hexadecimal equivalents using the standard URL escape characters in the form 00 where 00 is the equivalent hexadecimal code in order to conform to the rules for a legal file protocol URL.

A more preferable alternative means or module to cause or identify exception intercepts is a module that uses a special protocol designation to cause the linker to be invoked as a protocol handler such as tsh image.bmp or more generally tsh host path image.bmp in cases where the browser allows addition of new protocol handlers as some recently available versions do. This scheme can also be useful in embodiments where all URLs are intercepted.

To effect URL translations the link translator preferably comprises a separate set of lookup tables. In addition to specific or wild card designations of original URLs or URL classes against corresponding new URLs or URL classes separate lookup tables enable efficient tracking of link status time and date stamps and other relevant link data and also facilitate grouping of translations and status by web package for transport with a web package as a web package list providing an integrated product. Such a mechanism also facilitates the selection of a variety of Web pages from a Web site with properly managed links. It is not necessary to modify all local references to a newly supplied web package in advance the links can simply be intercepted and the web package list consulted live. Alternatively the coded URL may carry with it a web package identifier for an entire update or extension web package instead of or in addition to the specification of a specific target URL depending on the variety of access modes and richness of content structure to be supported.

Such mechanisms are very effective for what might be regarded as passive content such as text images and even multimedia retrieved by the user for independent use at their local station but greater difficulties may arise with dynamic changeable content for example cases of client server interaction needed for forms handling searches image map selections JAVA trademark applets and push pull content.

To carry out these dynamic activities locally or in shuttle mode the invention provides local simulation of the server functionality to complete the interaction. As an alternative a special server connection can be employed to effect the necessary server interaction in a short automated session. Such innovations are believed feasible but some limitation of functionality may be desirable. Forms can be included in web packages as blanks and sent in to the server when filled out. Searches can be passed as standard Web searches or selected result pages could be included also to avoid a subsequent reconnect. Image maps can be converted to local image maps and push pull can be facilitated with local scripting as desired. JAVA applets and live objects such as director movies should run satisfactorily locally given necessary browser support.

Other schemes for coding links to achieve the purposes of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art who will also understand the value of the novel link coding capability of the invention in enabling many useful applications including web packages with active hyperlinks as described.

Such novel web packages in turn can stimulate a variety of new applications and ways of using Web content or other material compatible with Web standards especially when combined with the transporter of the invention into automated web package transport embodiments. For example ready access to web package content furnished by a sponsor from a remote server using the transporter for user driven dial up retrieval of the content can introduce non Web users to Web content and attract them to online services adoption of which can be facilitated by incorporation of a Web or Internet access provider s subscription package or enabling shell in the Web package.

It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the link management modules and methodology of the invention and its application to web packages as described are quite unlike conventional web page cache managers commonly used by browsers temporarily to hold recently accessed pages at the local station for subsequent quick access. Conventional local Web page cache managers are not presently standardized making it difficult to communicate therewith via an extension module such as the inventive component for direct dial up access and suffer from the drawbacks that communications access is assumed to be readily available at all times to replace or add pages and cached objects are automatically purged under simple policies such as least recently used . Thus the content of conventional Web page cache managers is transient in nature rather than persistent and the cache managers are unsuitable for effecting the offline browsing and other link management functions of the invention as described above. Furthermore such conventional Web page cache managers currently neither offer nor can readily be extended to support the required set of link management and relocation features described herein.

Nevertheless in one preferred embodiment of the invention a conventional Web page cache manager can be used to enhance the invention for example in a case where the browser and associated cache is custom built for use in online and shuttle mode or where an adequately featured cache facility is standardized and generally available across a useful population of browsers. For these purposes the conventional browser preferably provides or can be extended to provide the necessary functionality and offers a suitable API or other control interface to manage the local objects.

As noted hereinabove it will be understood that the described approach to link management applies to remote hyperlinked content in general whether based on current URL usage or current or future variants extensions or other equivalents of URLs. This includes object oriented approaches to the handling of hyperlinks using object containers for URLs or other hyperlinks such as those known in the art as monikers .

While described to serve the purposes of offline browsing it will be apparent that the described link management features of the invention can be employed in other situations where it is desired to redirect links.

The ability to manage links as described herein enables a number of new Web capabilities to be provided serving various recognized and previously unrecognized needs. Properly implemented using the teachings of the invention a user can smoothly interwork local shuttle and live modes for static content formats for example HTML images multimedia and the like. Some applications of the link management aspects of the invention to filling these needs will now be described while others will be apparent to those skilled in the art or will become apparent as the art develops.

The link interceptor function can be modified to perform many other valuable functions to add value to the basic hypertext functions provided by the standard network protocols. For example current protocols provide no facility to deal with links which point to content which has been moved or deleted or which reference a server that is no longer maintained to be accessible on the network or which is other wise unavailable they simply cause an error message to be displayed when such an empty link is selected. As at the date of this application such empty links are a relatively minor nuisance. However their proliferation will become increasingly problematic as linked content developed by uncoordinated and perhaps undisciplined sources grows and evolves. Eventually these empty links could seriously impede Internet traffic like so many parked cars on the highway. A proposed solution yet to be standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force involves the use of new forms of link specification which embed indirect but permanent Uniform Resource Names instead of URLs but this is some time off because of complex policy issues and has the drawbacks of requiring changes to embedded pointers in existing content and imposes a relocation overhead on every access. A stopgap approach similarly based on embedding indirect links called Persistent URLs has recently been proposed by the Online Computer Library Center but has similar weaknesses.

Pursuant to an extended embodiment of the invention browsers can be modified using the various browser modification or extension facilities described herein or their equivalents to provide a solution to this problem that needs no change to current content and imposes overhead only on an exception basis.

Thus to solve the problem of empty links the invention provides a modified browser including a link management module to react to messages generated by failure of a link owing to an inadequate response from its destination by calling an enhanced version of the link interceptor module which includes one or more link search components which is invoked to seek to alternative locations for the desired content or an exploration of its unavailability and then provide an adjusted link pointer back to the browser for presentation to the user. As time passes the number of aged or obsolescent links must be expected to become quite voluminous spawning the need for a link relocation or archive server to maintain the alternative location or explanatory data needed by link search components at the browser. The invention includes such a link archive server as well as modified browsers as described intended to work cooperatively therewith whether in online or offline mode.

A variety of computer implemented software mechanisms can be used by such a link archive server to provide an archiving and relocation service pursuant to the invention. Preferably one or more special purpose archive and relocation servers is set up to maintain relocation information and optionally copies of the lost content from the empty links. A link interceptor module at the user s station cooperative or integral with their browser is configured to query the relocation servers with a failing URL and receive or retrieve a response containing a corrected URL if known. Thus for example if a page at

Information on such relocations could be submitted to the relocation server through various means and an active spider process could be applied being initiated for example from the relocation server to monitor the structure of the Web and detect changes. The spider would save the content or preferably a short coded signature for each page and then on subsequent scans would identify relocated pages using the saved content or signatures and note the new addresses for responding to inquiries from the link interceptor. Preferably any relocations that were uncertain would be flagged with a coding that would allow the viewer to be warned of the possibility of error. Such archive servers could also offer an optional repository service for useful pages no longer maintained or maintained in some new location by the original source or sponsor. The relocation and archive servers could be maintained as a for fee service or sponsored through various mechanisms including advertising as are search sites currently.

Where feasible for content servers which remain operative but have content that has been moved or deleted an alternative and perhaps more desirable method of implementing such relocation functions would be at the content server preferably by convention. Thus for example a server could add a basic relocation server function for pages that had previously been available from that server. Thus for example if a page at

The link interceptor module when configured to intercept all or selected external links or Get URL requests enables user activity to be screened so that undesired requests can be denied or filtered out. Such a screening process can be used to prevent users retrieving inappropriate content for example content judged indecent or obscene or from competitors Web sites so long as an address or URL for that content is known. If the user attempts to get an URL on the excluded list Object Not Available can be returned.

The link interceptor module can access a list or table of excluded addresses which may be maintained locally or accessed at a remote site the access or a periodic refresh can of course be effected by transporter if desired. Where a third party for example the Internet Service Provider ISP herein can furnish descriptive classifications of site content by address or URL as being indecent violent politically incorrect or the like and password coded setup routine can also be provided enabling a supervisor of the local station to filter out certain categories of content. Thus a parent can use a password or multiple passwords to control what content their children view.

It will be appreciated that the link management intercept and relocation aspects of the invention and the concept of relative URLs while being particularly advantageous in assisting the implementation of offline browsing as described herein can be beneficial independently of the use of transporter for example to enable offline browsing independently of dial up updates or to enable en URL driven content screening module which could be a freestanding software component or program implemented at the user s station to screen the user s activity or at the ISP to screen or censor all link calls from the ISP s customers or elsewhere as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The invention also provides a computer implementable web package assembler enabling sets or packages of Web pages as described hereinabove to be assembled into useful web packages from content available at diverse locations on the Internet. A key component of such a web package assembler is a link relocation module to rationalize all hyperlink references within the package for local browsing.

Other useful components which can be included in such a novel web package assembler are a selection tool a retriever and a package assembler. The selection tool specifies the desired content ingredients of the web package in a manner susceptible to search and applies criteria to select suitable content elements from an existing content set which may be as diverse as a single database or directory of data or all Web site data available on the Internet. The retriever applies the selection tool over the content set to gather content elements for the web package or alternatively to gather a superset of content elements from which the web package can assembled.

The package assembler uses the selection tool to assemble a desired specific package or web package from the content elements generated by the retriever. These tools will now be described in more detail.

A preferred web package selection tool provides a time optimized selection process to economize on connection charges and which uses a focused methodology to achieve a brief connection. Because of the vastness of the World Wide Web and the extent of its content it is important that the selection tool apply a range of filters or selection criteria with optional specification or customization or plug in control of parameters for content source quality style and other parameters that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A particularly desirable feature is an option for explicit specification of desired content known to exist on the Web for example Web pages previously visited and preferably means e.g. drag and drop paste and copy or a separately windowed routine employing a file manager are provided to facilitate such desired content specification for example by posting respective URLs from the user s hotlists cache of visited sites vendor or sponsor supplied list or other offline or online retrievable source of URLs of potential interest.

The objective is to build a coherent package comprising a hyperlinked collection of content elements retrieved from multiple Internet or other appropriate dispersed source locations the content elements being handled and built in an environment of their original HTML or other standardized language without requiring conversion to proprietary application formats. Options for offline testing of a search query built from multiple parameters are desirable where feasible to avoid unnecessary or excess connection time.

The retriever tool uses the search tool and crawls across the Web like a Web spider to locate and retrieve desired or suitable content based on defined criteria in HTML format.

The analogies to a spider web and references to a Web spider and Web crawling are used to denote an organized search of Web sites involving visits to those sites rather than merely scanning the content of one or more search engines. Clearly a comprehensive search of the content available at any and all Web sites is a time consuming project. Crawling techniques can also include the pursuit of hyperlinks to relevant content and other techniques as are known to those skilled in the art.

Such a combined search and retrieve tool set can be used for other hyperlinked searchable content bases as desired.

The package assembler provides assembly of desired retrieved content elements into desired web packages combining them with any applets required to run display or otherwise use particular content or any other appropriate accessories.

The link relocation tool operates like the link relocation module described hereinabove to effect appropriate changes in links in the retrieved content. The link relocation module provides functionality to adjust hyperlink references in the retrieved content elements to point to other elements within the web package or as appropriate to point to other content elements in separate web packages which may also be retrieved or otherwise to be rewritten or redirected as described above. Proper resolution of links enables the tools to be used for managed retrieval of related packages as sets rather than as individual pages as in conventional Web browsing.

Appropriately used these tools enable the building of a web package of multiple pages from diverse locations to be automated combining Web crawling under specified search constraints.

While these tools will clearly have utility at the user s station a preferred embodiment of the invention locates them on a web package server accessible to users by direct dial up connection. If desired the web package server can be provided with facilities dynamically to assemble batches of content elements into standardized or customized web packages. Standardized web packages might for example be news items for a trade news letter that have been located at and retrieved from a number of sites relevant to activities in the trade are distributed to a population of users whereas customized web packages which are preferably dynamically assembled upon request are intended for an individual or small group of users meeting their specific content requirements.

The application of this package assembler and in the case of dynamic web package construction its use in conjunction with the above searching and gathering activities impose novel design constraints in that packages to be transmitted must preferably be compact and any content gathering done in real time must preferably be done in a way that minimizes call duration. This affects decisions as to how to search which items to select and in what form to present the results. For example size may become a parameter in determining which search results to remit to the requester. The issues and solutions of these decisions will generally be apparent to one skilled in the art but may vary from those typical in conventional online searching situations as will be apparent from the teachings herein. For example when web package construction is dynamic it will typically be desirable to apply a caching facility to keep frequently requested pages or sets of web package elements available at the web package server in order to keep access and assembly time to a minimum.

By efficient management of the communications process the invention enables calls to be terminated when pre specified information object transfers have been satisfactorily executed and furthermore enables the complete call process from dial up to hang up to be dedicated to automated fulfilment of the user s instructions in a single short burst connection the duration of which can be optimized by the transporter related functions described herein. This efficiency is in contrast to a typical online session where the connection can remain open running up time charges while the user reads and thinks about each page retrieved or is interrupted or performs other tasks and long after data transfer has ceased unless the user alertly disconnects. It is typical for such think time to be 10 20 times greater than the actual communication time. In addition the compression and object packaging or bundling features of the transporter can enable still greater efficiency in communications as compared with conventional Internet or other online access which typically retrieves uncompressed pages or messages one at a time by enabling compressed data transport to be implemented transparently to the user.

In a simple example new e mail may be retrieved and browsed while still online with a meter running whereas retrieved new mail could be browsed just as effectively off line. Employing the inventive transporter with suitable adaptations at the host server the user can fetch a manifest of new mail edit the manifest if desired fetch the new mail and automatically disconnect or alternatively disconnect a first e mail service and call up one or more other such services in a substantially automatic manner once configured.

Similarly the inventive transporter can be used to access bulletin boards and pull down objects relating to particular content threads of interest to the user.

Known special purpose e mail readers for short burst access to specific e mail and bulletin board systems are special purpose modules configured to fetch only mail objects addressed to the calling user not objects specified in a manifest and thus are not suitable for broadcast information object distribution or publication. Unlike the manifest employed in the present invention any list of files attached to an e mail does nothing to provide for further action upon receipt of the listed files nor because it is embedded in the e mail message can it be employed by a user information product or remote server to specify files or objects to be fetched. Nor do such e mail readers comprise separable software transporter components applicable to general purpose automated information object transport via managed dial up connections. The ability to optimize the communications process and automatically terminate it with a disconnect for an arbitrary variety of application content including Web browsing and searching uniquely disposes the inventive systems to provide a novel general purpose short burst data retrieval facility for off line users as described herein which is quite different from the limited dedicated functionality of e mail readers.

Short burst connectivity can simulate an online environment by coupling a transporter with one or more hyperlinks hot buttons or menu selectors enabling a user to effect multiple or repeated data retrieval operations in short bursts from one or more remote sources by clicking on links and hot buttons while they browse. In special cases where a dial up source for the destination information object of the hyperlink is known to be available a translation or readdressing module could automatically post appropriate header and other retrieval data from hyperlinks in imported content to the transporter and create a manifest for fetching the object from the dial up source enabling an online environment to be simulated. Such application of an intermittent short burst connectivity approach to browsing and searching of relatively extensive content such as collections of Web pages is quite distinct from conventional Web browsing and searching activities which function as a fully online continuously interactive process. Absent the teachings herein conventional wisdom would expect the inventive approach to be unduly static and limiting of interaction.

With present day modems some delay occurs in the dialing and handshake process which slows the dial up communication process and may somewhat hinder simulation of an online environment. Advancing technology may reduce these problems increasing the usefulness of the invention. Connections via ISDN are established much faster while connect time appears at present to be significantly more costly. Accordingly short burst embodiments of the invention have particular application to use via ISDN networks where retrieval of cumbersome graphics video and multimedia files may be important. The transporter can readily be adapted to offer a scheduling function providing users with an option to effect retrieval of bulky objects at an off peak low rate or low traffic time such as at night.

Using such short burst data retrieval a user can interact offline seamlessly merging retrieved data or objects with local data or objects in a rich and varied environment which may simulate an online session without the expense and inconvenience that sometimes accompanies extended online sessions. In many instances for example domestic environments freeing up a telephone line will be an important benefit especially to teenage computer users whose parents require a single phone line to be available. These benefits of short burst communication with minimal use of phone lines accompanied by off line browsing are of particular value in the case of interactive digital music CDS for example as supplied under an industry standard or agreed format such as Music Enhanced CD. Application of the invention to this environment will be described in more detail below.

The short burst access characteristics of the invention may be of particular value to mobile users who often do not have suitable access to adequate communications facilities. Wireless links are relatively expensive and slow and while improving can be expected to remain more costly and lower in speed than wireline service. The ability to concentrate activity into short efficient bursts and to pre position selected working sets of current content such as price lists and documentation in a portable system can be of great value to salesmen field workers and computer using working travelers of all kinds.

It will be apparent that applications of short burst intermittent connection can be extended to provide broad support for content searching and for efficient packaging and transmission of the resulting content as well as for transaction processing in general as referenced above for example by automating and managing communication with a remote search engine. In doing so the implementation details of the transporter functions and interfaces would preferably be tuned and adapted as appropriate to efficiently and effectively serve the particular purposes addressed by various useful sub classes of applications as will be understood by one skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

As described in the parent application the invention provides a flexible vehicle for transaction processing in many different ways via both real time gateway connections and non real time store and forward linkages. Such transactions can be EDI compliant or use other remote ordering protocols for real or de facto standards including HTML forms and Sun Systems JAVA trademark applets and gain the benefits of short burst communication optimized for reduced communication time. In this manner the benefits of the inventive transporter can be obtained in a way that interworks with and applies useful portions of transaction control user interface and security software infrastructure that may be available for use at the user and transaction server ends of the transaction chain.

Moving web packages in or with a transporter both as described pursuant to the invention creates what may be termed a web package shuttle . With the short session and simple connection advantages the invention provides a powerful general purpose transaction processing capability is enabled having advantages similar to those described for information transport. Such a transaction processing mechanism can adopt any other relevant aspects of the invention described herein including intermittent or short burst repeated connections gatewaying between a vendor or sponsor s server or a special purpose server and a Web server or Internet point of access so long as form based transactions or their equivalent are supported. Store and forward is also useful in this context so that many transactions can be collected on a special purpose server for later processing elsewhere.

The Music CD Extra format is a standard supported by Microsoft Sony Philips and other industry leaders for a class of high quality recorded audio products distributed on CD with CD ROM compatible user multimedia capable interactivity enabling users to enhance the music experience stored in ANSI standard CD audio red book format playable on standard CD audio players with suitable ancillary content such as liner notes pictures video clips artist data lyrics discography concert schedules fan club information and so on encoded in CD ROM compatible ANSI standard yellow book format playable on standard CD ROM players .

Variant combined formats have seen limited use and all of these are collectively referred to as Enhanced CDS. Comparable standards and formats promoting interactive environments for recorded products may be expected for other media and products for example video products and DVDs as well as High Density CD the DVD based follow on format for CD audio and CD ROM.

Such interactive music products may also include online links to the Web or other online services. However to the inventor s knowledge and belief available products provide or require traditional open ended online sessions with their associated drawbacks.

The invention provides a novel interactive recorded music product comprising stored on distributable physical media a music recording and an information transporter as described herein coded for automated communication with a pre specified remote content source particularly but not exclusively a digital music CD which preferably also includes supplemental interactive capability relevant to the music recording.

Typically the remote content comprises ancillary content as described above. The remote source preferably comprises a server maintained on behalf of a vendor or sponsor of the music product accessed by direct dial to a number stored or retrievable via a number stored by or for the transporter. In a preferred embodiment a commercial vendor or supplier of the music product maintains a server with ancillary content of interest to purchasers of the music product and preinstalls the transporter with an 800 or ordinary phone number providing automated access to that server. Either in the original product or in an object automatically fetched by the transporter a content list of available choices can be provided enabling the user to select desired objects to be fetched. When the selected object or objects has been satisfactorily retrieved the transporter or an associated user interface either terminates communications or gives the user the option to transport another object to or from the remote source.

Alternatively to direct dial access to a vendor maintained remote server the transporter can be coded to access the Web or equivalent online network via an access provider to retrieve one or more specified information objects from the Web using an URL and to terminate the online session after receipt of the specified objects. If desired after retrieval of an object via the online network confirmation or other data can be returned to a predesignated server via direct dial to that server bypassing the online network.

A music industry application of the invention can thus embody the inventive offline browser system described above as a music supplementer system particularly adapted to the requirements of Music CD Extra and Music Enhanced CD formats providing useful benefits to users lacking online subscriptions.

The music supplementer system MSS herein can comprise an offline browser system with direct dial support a local browser viewer module with HTML Web page viewing functionality and preferably with a base set of content elements in HTML format with optional selections of standard Web content or other material for example Adobe s ACROBAT trademark or other viewers. The base content elements can conform to an enabling specification appropriate to the MSS and can include any desired content for example a basic home page a tour schedule page a multi media download page a fan club page a merchandise page a news page and an artists or other artists page. Preferably any links on these pages are edited modified or managed for local execution as described herein. Such pages can be functionally modified versions of online available Web pages as described above. Key functions can be controlled and customized using HTML pages or in other appropriate ways while the invocation of control functions can be done by intercepting links employing a helper application or via API or viewer customization or other means as described hereinabove.

Various special purpose useful links can be provided for example a Get Update link in a home page that refreshes base content by retrieval from a remote source and provides specified optional elements.

Links to optional items for download can trigger transporter functions as described to fetch the optional item object if it is not present locally or can simply invoke the object or a viewer for the object if it is present locally. Such objects could for example include audio or video samples.

Transaction pages simulating actual Web pages if desired can be provided to trigger sends to a remote server to enable joining a fan club or ordering merchandise or other user initiated transaction. Simple transporter send functions can be used for information submission such as product registrations and server response and gateway functions can be employed when a response or confirmation is needed.

A user control facility to edit a fetch and send list for the transporter activatable from any desired page can also be provided.

A client system content control component or function to be implemented at the user s station to track the presence and status of information objects on the user s storage facilities including any CD ROM and hard disk can be provided to control link execution and editing along with a link manager as described.

A drawback of a distributed online network such as the Internet which lacks central administration is the difficulty of implementing convenient charging mechanisms. Telephone networks provide a number of charging options notably caller paid charges collect calls which reverse charges to the called party subject to the called party s selective approval sponsor paid 800 and 888 calls where all calls are paid by the called party and caller paid 900 calls which provide for revenue splitting between the telephone company and the called party.

Such services are not generally available on the Internet. Credit cards are now being widely used on the Internet although some people have lingering security concerns. However though useful for major purchases credit cards are not suitable for small time related charges and do not offer a medium enabling sponsors to provide free access. Standard Internet charging methods require establishment of a subscription with an access provider such as one of the major online services for example CompuServe and America Online or with one of the specialized Internet service providers and generally include usage time related charges either explicitly or implicitly . This approach has the drawbacks described above for casual first time and occasional users and limits the marketing uses of the Internet.

Networks managed by centralized service providers for example SPRINTNET or BT TYMNET trademarks offer systems enabling such networks to simulate some telephone network charging capabilities. Thus the X.25 standard for packet switching networks provides reverse charging options and a call negotiation process that determines whether a called server or host will accept collect calls. A caller or user must supply a billed account ID and password for caller paid charges or may be furnished with a special reverse charge account ID and password.

X.75 standards permit call negotiation and reverse charging mechanisms to be applied across interconnections between individual X 25 networks allowing some global coordination. Internet protocols do not provide for such call negotiation and charging management. The packet switched X.25 model does not appear to solve the problem of overcoming the access providers charges and formalities that impede novices and casual users and prevent true casual sponsor paid access by any modem equipped computer user to the sponsor s Internet site because it is specific to the X.25 protocol and no provision for an equivalent capability is provided for in the Internet protocol.

To solve these and other problems the invention provides an Internet charging mechanism including computer implemented enabling software in the form of a charge management module to be applied as a higher level protocol above the enabling online network protocol such for example as the Internet TCP IP protocols. The charge management module preferably comprises user server and access point components operated at the nodes or points of access to identify collect and other calls at each access point to provide session negotiation functions and to determine if a called server will accept charges before a call is completed. Hosts that accept collect calls can have an option of selectively controlling access to specific account IDs.

User components of the charge management module preferably include a user interface button or other selection requesting sponsored access to a resource and which is effective to activate the charge management mechanism on the network or such requests could be an automatic default or implied by the URL specified. The access point module can collect usage data for calls made via the access point operator and generate bills and call details for the sponsor. The sponsor or server component screens and authorizes or rejects call requests received from the access point. The details of this process could be specific to a single ISP to work among users and servers directly connected to its network only but preferably a common coordinating mechanism analogous to X.75 could be used by a large number of cooperating ISPs.

900 number equivalent revenue collecting functionality can be provided by means of a billing gateway sewer established to manage session setup for revenue generating calls using specially charged account IDs. The billing servers can allocate a caller s account and credit status identify the pricing algorithms to be applied for the called server and maintain an activity record for end user billing.

Such increased flexibility in charging can enhance and facilitate widespread use of the Internet for both short burst connectivity applications and for fully online applications. Coupled with the capabilities of the inventive transporter such novel charging mechanisms can enable new Internet or other online network market services such for example as allowing non subscribing users to obtain free sponsored service or to obtain service for fee on a discrete ad hoc time of need basis.

Searching of the Web or Internet or other adequately standardized wide area network replete with data sources can be understood and accomplished using the transporter as a special case of transaction handling using similar mechanisms to those described above for transaction handling. Thus a search request is simply a send transaction to a search engine which responds with a fetch object also referenced as a response object in the parent application comprising a result list or bit list of objects found to match the search which is then returned to the user at which time a disconnection can be made. This result can then be used as normal hyperlinked content to obtain the actual target objects in a subsequent request or a revised search transaction can be submitted. In a similar manner to what was described in relation to browsing the effect of an ongoing interactive session for searching and transactions can be simulated by a series of short burst transporter implemented connections.

This intermittent mode of searching can be further exploited using techniques such as those described in the parent application for combining indexes or other content into a single seamless search. As described an index or content set on CD ROM could be supplemented by an updated supplementary index or content set that had been subsequently retrieved to hard disk. It will be apparent that the searching as transaction approach can be used in the same way to supplement information already retrieved. For example a search of content on CD and hard disk which is current as of a given date can be supplemented by a search transaction requesting the same search and additionally specifying that the results be limited to content with a date more recent than that given date. In this way only the new items not already present would be retrieved for optimum efficiency in search and transmission time. The result can then be merged with the local results to produce a fully current complete result again sorted in whatever order is desired . This approach permits very significant benefits for example in the case of the searching of general purpose Internet indexes such as YAHOO or LYCOS trademarks where repeated identical searches may be done weeks or months apart with redundancy in all but the most recent results only the incremental content need actually be obtained and transmitted. Since much Internet activity consist of just such searches the processing and communications cost savings are potentially very sizeable. Widespread adoption of such connect time optimized search techniques could even help economize on Internet traffic.

A further valuable application of the information object transporter of the invention is to enable a novel interactive communications system by providing back channel communications via dial up connections from a population of users to a broadcaster distributing analog or digital material over a one way primary channel such as TV air cable or satellite or data subchannels. Employing a configuration as described in Level this is primarily a send application where users send objects such as a customer service responses video program requests or the like back to the broadcaster or a vendor coupled to the broadcaster by dial up or equivalent over a telephone or equivalent point to point network.

Optionally the inventive transporter may be used to fetch objects communicated over the primary broadcast channel. In this case the active request for a fetch object in the manifest could be effected in various ways depending on the nature of the network and the request. If the request were for a standard object scheduled for transmittal via the primary broadcast channel the transporter would simply request of the local broadcast interface that the object be provided when received. Custom broadcast transmissions could be first requested via a send through the back channel as described above. It will be understood that fetched objects may be transmitted over either channel with the best choice depending on the characteristics of the network including any local station addressability characteristics the content and the traffic patterns.

Prior to the date of this application the concept of publishing on the Web has become a commonplace. Publication is achieved simply by posting a Web page or pages at a Web site where any Web user is free to examine the posting. In addition it may be assumed that one or more search engines will eventually locate the content leading interested browsers to the site and links leading from other Web sites may be setup. Unlike publication in the more commonly understood sense of mass distribution of copies of a document or other work Web publication is passive in nature a single copy of the work assembled according to Web standards is posted for browsers to read and copy rather like a document in a library.

Thus a would be Web publisher merely has to prepare their content and post it to a suitable site. Since Web sites are computer servers located remotely from the ordinary user or browser and an ordinary user may have difficulties in mastering the complexities of transmitting files to such a server it will be apparent that the inventive transporter provides an excellent means of facilitating the transport of documents or other objects from their would be publishers with local modem equipped computer stations to a Web server via direct dial up connection using any appropriate ones of the tools and architectures described herein. Equally the transporter can be used to shuttle acknowledgment and other publication confirmation details back to the originating user. In such an application users will typically have basic Internet connectivity and this will preferably be employed by the transporter. A benefit of using the transporter is simplification of the transaction for both the user and the service provider.

Thus the transporter can provide an automatic upload including connection interaction with a user interface to enable selection of files for Web publication execute a send to load the content to a Web server a logically distinct server which may be accessed via a distribution server as described herein and if desired submitted to a search engine via a gateway connection also as described.

New or improved electronic information products are made possible by the novel information transporter disclosed herein for example CD ROM based products updated from online services updatable periodical magazine collections catalog based computer shopping with order entry and optionally order confirmation.

A CD ROM based product with online service updatability called MICROSOFT Complete Baseball MICROSOFT is a trademark was announced by Microsoft Corporation apparently on Mar. 1 1994 with a Jun. 15 1994 availability date. A product brochure received by the present inventor on April 26 describes a multimedia history of baseball which can be updated with daily scores from an online service by modem. Nothing in the sales materials suggests any separable information transport components marketable for use with other information products.

In late April 1994 CompuServe trademark online information service announced plans for a CD ROM information product to be used in conjunction with its online service. The CompuServe CD ROM information product online service is usable only with that service and requires users of its online component to be CompuServe member subscribers on terms such as described above which terms restrict the CD ROM product s marketability. The CD ROM content and user interface is limited to that provided by CompuServe . Accordingly such a dedicated CD ROM service is not a satisfactory solution to independent publishers looking for economical update means because they will be limited to whatever user interface and data management flexibility the online vendor may provide which will substantially restrict any creative look and feel identity the publisher may have provided in their own product. Thus the CD ROM product is described by CompuServe in the statement It is essentially a new window on CompuServe . . . . This product description does not suggest an ability to obtain updated online information for integrated local offline use with an original information product stored on the CD ROM as is provided by the present invention.

In addition to CD ROM based products various new information distribution methods and services are made possible by embodiments of the present invention. The object source can be a remote server equipped with a cooperative communications module closely molded to work effortlessly with the information transporter for distributing objects to a wide base of users. Such a remote server can be linked to a vendor or gatewayed to other information object sources or electronic publishers and exploit its smooth and efficient information transport capabilities to act as a distribution point for such vendors sources or publishers.

Thus the invention further comprises such a special purpose server designed for use with the novel information transporter and the special purpose server can be established as a distribution service for publishers who incorporate the information transporter in their products. The invention also provides a method of operating a server to provide such a software service and server enabling software.

While an illustrative embodiment of the invention has been described above it is of course understood that various modifications will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications are within the spirit and scope of the invention which is limited and defined only by the appended claims.
