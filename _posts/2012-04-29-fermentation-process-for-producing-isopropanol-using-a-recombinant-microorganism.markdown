This is application is a Continuation In Part of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 403 972 filed on Feb. 23 2012 which in turn claims the priority of Provisional Application No. 61 446 832 filed on Feb. 25 2011 all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to methods for the production of acetone isopropanol and or a precursor of acetone and or isopropanol by microbial fermentation of gaseous substrates comprising carbon monoxide using genetically modified micro organisms.

Some microorganisms such as or are known to produce acetone or isopropanol as major by products during butanol fermentation ABE or IBE fermentation George H A Johnson J L Moore W E C Holdeman L V Chen J S Acetone isopropanol and butanol production by syn. and 45 1160 1163 . However all these organisms rely on sugar or starch based substrates. Acetogenic organisms such as the closely related microorganisms and are able to grow chemoautotrophically on CO or CO Hcontaining gases as sole energy and carbon source and synthesize products such as acetate ethanol or 2 3 butanediol but neither acetone nor isopropanol Munasinghe P C Khanal S K Biomass derived syngas fermentation into biofuels Opportunities and challenges. 2010 5013 22 .

Recently production of isopropanol was reported in a study on P11 in a 100 L pilot scale fermentor from switchgrass derived syngas Kundiyana D K Huhnke R L Wilkins M R Syngas fermentation in a 100 L pilot scale fermentor Design and process considerations. 2010 109 492 498 . However a related study from the same lab showed that this was due to a contamination in the used syngas since it was passed through a scrubbing mixture containing 20 acetone Ramachandriya K D Effect of biomass generated producer gas methane and physical parameters on producer gas fermentations by strain P11. Masters thesis Oklahoma State University 2009 . The authors also noted that the production of isopropanol may be the result of reduction of propionic acid rather than acetone. Experiments carried out by the inventors of the present invention with strain P11 and also and have never shown the production of acetone isopropanol or propionic acid.

The cost of many carbohydrate feed stocks suitable for the production of chemical products such as acetone and isoproanol is influenced by their value as human food or animal feed and the cultivation of starch or sucrose producing crops for such production is not economically sustainable in all geographies. Therefore it is of interest to develop technologies to convert lower cost and or more abundant carbon resources into useful chemical products such as acetone and isopropanol.

CO is a major free energy rich by product of the incomplete combustion of organic materials such as coal or oil and oil derived products. For example the steel industry in Australia is reported to produce and release into the atmosphere over 500 000 tonnes of CO annually.

It is an object of the invention to overcome one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art or to at least to provide the public with a useful choice.

The inventors have also surprisingly been able to demonstrate the natural enzymatic conversion of acetone to isopropanol in presence of CO containing gases by closely related carboxydotrophic acetogenic species and . A novel alcohol dehydrogenase was identified which was shown to be expressed constitutively at a high level during a normal fermentation run with and is able to convert acetone to isopropanol at high concentrations and ratios. The inventors have also found two genes that surprisingly confer activity towards acetone and isopropanol in . These genes an alpha ketoacid decarboxylase Kivd from and an alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from haven t been reported to confer activity towards acetone or isopropanol or any of it s precursors rather converting amino acid precursors into branched chain alcohols. The inventors demonstrated production of acetone and isopropanol from CO in using several different gene and enzyme combinations.

Accordingly the invention provides for example methods for the production of acetone isopropanol and or precursors of acetone and or isopropanol by microbial fermentation of substrates comprising CO genetically modified microorganisms of use in such methods nucleic acids suitable for preparation of genetically modified microorganisms and novel alcohol dehydrogenases and nucleic acids encoding same.

While it is not necessary for the substrate to contain any hydrogen the presence of Hshould not be detrimental to product formation in accordance with methods of the invention. In particular embodiments the presence of hydrogen results in an improved overall efficiency of alcohol production. For example in particular embodiments the substrate may comprise an approx 2 1 or 1 1 or 1 2 ratio of H CO. In one embodiment the substrate comprises about 30 or less Hby volume 20 or less Hby volume about 15 or less Hby volume or about 10 or less Hby volume. In other embodiments the substrate stream comprises low concentrations of H for example less than 5 or less than 4 or less than 3 or less than 2 or less than 1 or is substantially hydrogen free. The substrate may also contain some COfor example such as about 1 to about 80 COby volume or 1 to about 30 COby volume. In one embodiment the substrate comprises less than or equal to about 20 COby volume.

In the description which follows embodiments of the invention are described in terms of delivering and fermenting a gaseous substrate containing CO . However it should be appreciated that the gaseous substrate may be provided in alternative forms. For example the gaseous substrate containing CO may be provided dissolved in a liquid. Essentially a liquid is saturated with a carbon monoxide containing gas and then that liquid is added to the bioreactor. This may be achieved using standard methodology. By way of example a microbubble dispersion generator Hensirisak et. al. Scale up of microbubble dispersion generator for aerobic fermentation Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology Volume 101 Number 3 October 2002 could be used. By way of further example the gaseous substrate containing CO may be adsorbed onto a solid support. Such alternative methods are encompassed by use of the term substrate containing CO and the like.

In particular embodiments of the invention the CO containing gaseous substrate is an industrial off or waste gas. Industrial waste or off gases should be taken broadly to include any gases comprising CO produced by an industrial process and include gases produced as a result of ferrous metal products manufacturing non ferrous products manufacturing petroleum refining processes gasification of coal gasification of biomass electric power production carbon black production and coke manufacturing. Further examples may be provided elsewhere herein.

Unless the context requires otherwise the phrases fermenting fermentation process or fermentation reaction and the like as used herein are intended to encompass both the growth phase and product biosynthesis phase of the process. As will be described further herein in some embodiments the bioreactor may comprise a first growth reactor and a second fermentation reactor. As such the addition of metals or compositions to a fermentation reaction should be understood to include addition to either or both of these reactors.

The term bioreactor includes a fermentation device consisting of one or more vessels and or towers or piping arrangement which includes the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor CSTR Immobilized Cell Reactor ICR Trickle Bed Reactor TBR Bubble Column Gas Lift Fermenter Static Mixer or other vessel or other device suitable for gas liquid contact. In some embodiments the bioreactor may comprise a first growth reactor and a second fermentation reactor. As such when referring to the addition of substrate to the bioreactor or fermentation reaction it should be understood to include addition to either or both of these reactors where appropriate.

 Exogenous nucleic acids are nucleic acids which originate outside of the microorganism to which they are introduced. Exogenous nucleic acids may be derived from any appropriate source including but not limited to the microorganism to which they are to be introduced strains or species of microorganisms which differ from the organism to which they are to be introduced or they may be artificially or recombinantly created. In one embodiment the exogenous nucleic acids represent nucleic acid sequences naturally present within the microorganism to which they are to be introduced and they are introduced to increase expression of or over express a particular gene for example by increasing the copy number of the sequence for example a gene or introducing a strong or constitutive promoter to increase expression . In another embodiment the exogenous nucleic acids represent nucleic acid sequences not naturally present within the microorganism to which they are to be introduced and allow for the expression of a product not naturally present within the microorganism or increased expression of a gene native to the microorganism for example in the case of introduction of a regulatory element such as a promoter . The exogenous nucleic acid may be adapted to integrate into the genome of the microorganism to which it is to be introduced or to remain in an extra chromosomal state.

It should be appreciated that the invention may be practised using nucleic acids whose sequence varies from the sequences specifically exemplified herein provided they perform substantially the same function. For nucleic acid sequences that encode a protein or peptide this means that the encoded protein or peptide has substantially the same function. For nucleic acid sequences that represent promoter sequences the variant sequence will have the ability to promote expression of one or more genes. Such nucleic acids may be referred to herein as functionally equivalent variants . By way of example functionally equivalent variants of a nucleic acid include allelic variants fragments of a gene genes which include mutations deletion insertion nucleotide substitutions and the like and or polymorphisms and the like. Homologous genes from other microorganisms may also be considered as examples of functionally equivalent variants of the sequences specifically exemplified herein. These include homologous genes in species such as and details of which are publicly available on websites such as Genbank or NCBI. In the case of genes derived from and homologous genes may be found for example in for example NP 765765.1 EGG67352.1 ZP 04826144.1 ZP 04797999.1 for example ZP 04273468.1 ZP 04317620.1 and for example YP 003664720.1 . The phrase functionally equivalent variants should also be taken to include nucleic acids whose sequence varies as a result of codon optimisation for a particular organism. Functionally equivalent variants of a nucleic acid herein will preferably have at least approximately 70 preferably approximately 80 more preferably approximately 85 preferably approximately 90 preferably approximately 95 or greater nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid identified.

It should also be appreciated that the invention may be practised using polypeptides whose sequence varies from the amino acid sequences specifically exemplified herein. These variants may be referred to herein as functionally equivalent variants . A functionally equivalent variant of a protein or a peptide includes those proteins or peptides that share at least 40 preferably 50 preferably 60 preferably 70 preferably 75 preferably 80 preferably 85 preferably 90 preferably 95 or greater amino acid identity with the protein or peptide identified and has substantially the same function as the peptide or protein of interest. Such variants include within their scope fragments of a protein or peptide wherein the fragment comprises a truncated form of the polypeptide wherein deletions may be from 1 to 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 to 25 amino acids and may extend from residue 1 through 25 at either terminus of the polypeptide and wherein deletions may be of any length within the region or may be at an internal location. Functionally equivalent variants of the specific polypeptides herein should also be taken to include polypeptides expressed by homologous genes in other species of bacteria for example as exemplified in the previous paragraph.

 Substantially the same function as used herein is intended to mean that the nucleic acid or polypeptide is able to perform the function of the nucleic acid or polypeptide of which it is a variant. For example a variant of an enzyme of the invention will be able to catalyse the same reaction as that enzyme. However it should not be taken to mean that the variant has the same level of activity as the polypeptide or nucleic acid of which it is a variant.

One may assess whether a functionally equivalent variant has substantially the same function as the nucleic acid or polypeptide of which it is a variant using any number of known methods. However by way of example the methods outlined in Wiesenborn et al Thiolase from ATCC 824 and Its Role in the Synthesis of Acids and Solvents. 1988 54 2717 2722 Wiesenborn et al Coenzyme A transferase from ATCC 824 and its role in the uptake of acids. 1989 55 323 9.

It will be appreciated that the minimal size of such nucleic acids is a size which is capable of forming a stable hybrid between a given nucleic acid and the complementary sequence to which it is designed to hybridise.

Nucleic acids and nucleic acid constructs including expression constructs vectors of the invention may be constructed using any number of techniques standard in the art. For example chemical synthesis or recombinant techniques may be used. Such techniques are described for example in Sambrook et al Molecular Cloning A laboratory manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 .

Essentially the individual genes and regulatory elements will be operably linked to one another such that the genes can be expressed to form the desired proteins.

It should be appreciated that nucleic acids of the invention may be in any appropriate form including RNA DNA or cDNA.

Suitable transformation techniques are described for example in Sambrook J Fritsch E F Maniatis T Molecular Cloning A laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbour 1989.

In certain embodiments due to the restriction systems which are active in the microorganism to be transformed it is necessary to methylate the nucleic acid to be introduced into the microorganism. This can be done using a variety of techniques including those described below and further exemplified in the Examples section herein after.

By way of example in one embodiment a recombinant microorganism of the invention is produced by a method comprises the following steps 

introduction into a shuttle microorganism of i of an expression construct vector as described herein and ii a methylation construct vector comprising a methyltransferase gene 

In one embodiment the methyltransferase gene of step B is expressed constitutively. In another embodiment expression of the methyltransferase gene of step B is induced.

The shuttle microorganism is a microorganism preferably a restriction negative microorganism that facilitates the methylation of the nucleic acid sequences that make up the expression construct vector. In a particular embodiment the shuttle microorganism is a restriction negative or

Once the expression construct vector and the methylation construct vector are introduced into the shuttle microorganism the methyltransferase gene present on the methylation construct vector is induced. Induction may be by any suitable promoter system although in one particular embodiment of the invention the methylation construct vector comprises an inducible lac promoter preferably encoded by SEQ ID NO 50 and is induced by addition of lactose or an analogue thereof more preferably isopropyl D thio galactoside IPTG . Other suitable promoters include the ara tet or T7 system. In a further embodiment of the invention the methylation construct vector promoter is a constitutive promoter.

In a particular embodiment the methylation construct vector has an origin of replication specific to the identity of the shuttle microorganism so that any genes present on the methylation construct vector are expressed in the shuttle microorganism. Preferably the expression construct vector has an origin of replication specific to the identity of the destination microorganism so that any genes present on the expression construct vector are expressed in the destination microorganism.

Expression of the methyltransferase enzyme results in methylation of the genes present on the expression construct vector. The expression construct vector may then be isolated from the shuttle microorganism according to any one of a number of known methods. By way of example only the methodology described in the Examples section described hereinafter may be used to isolate the expression construct vector.

The expression construct vector may be introduced into the destination microorganism using any number of known methods. However by way of example the methodology described in the Examples section hereinafter may be used. Since the expression construct vector is methylated the nucleic acid sequences present on the expression construct vector are able to be incorporated into the destination microorganism and successfully expressed.

It is envisaged that a methyltransferase gene may be introduced into a shuttle microorganism and over expressed. Thus in one embodiment the resulting methyltransferase enzyme may be collected using known methods and used in vitro to methylate an expression plasmid. The expression construct vector may then be introduced into the destination microorganism for expression. In another embodiment the methyltransferase gene is introduced into the genome of the shuttle microorganism followed by introduction of the expression construct vector into the shuttle microorganism isolation of one or more constructs vectors from the shuttle microorganism and then introduction of the expression construct vector into the destination microorganism.

It is envisaged that the expression construct vector and the methylation construct vector as defined above may be combined to provide a composition of matter. Such a composition has particular utility in circumventing restriction barrier mechanisms to produce the recombinant microorganisms of the invention.

In one particular embodiment the expression construct vector and or the methylation construct vector are plasmids.

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate a number of suitable methyltransferases of use in producing the microorganisms of the invention. However by way of example the phage T1 methyltransferase and the methyltransferase described in the Examples herein after may be used. In one embodiment the methyltransferase has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 34 or is a functionally equivalent variant thereof. Nucleic acids encoding suitable methyltransferases will be readily appreciated having regard to the sequence of the desired methyltransferase and the genetic code. In one embodiment the nucleic acid encoding a methyltransferase is as described in the Examples herein after for example the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO 35 or it is a functionally equivalent variant thereof .

Any number of constructs vectors adapted to allow expression of a methyltransferase gene may be used to generate the methylation construct vector. However by way of example the plasmid described in the Examples section hereinafter may be used. In one particular embodiment the plasmid has the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 49.

The invention provides a method for the production of one or more desirable products acetone isopropanol and or or a precursor of acetone and or isopropanol by microbial fermentation comprising fermenting a substrate comprising CO using a recombinant microorganism of the invention. The methods of the invention may be used to reduce the total atmospheric carbon emissions from an industrial process.

Preferably the fermentation comprises the steps of anaerobically fermenting a substrate in a bioreactor to produce the one or more products using a recombinant microorganism of the invention.

In an embodiment of the invention the gaseous substrate fermented by the microorganism is a gaseous substrate comprising CO. The gaseous substrate may be a CO containing waste gas obtained as a by product of an industrial process or from some other source such as from automobile exhaust fumes. In certain embodiments the industrial process is selected from the group consisting of ferrous metal products manufacturing such as a steel mill non ferrous products manufacturing petroleum refining processes gasification of coal gasification of biomass electric power production carbon black production ammonia production methanol production and coke manufacturing. In these embodiments the CO containing gas may be captured from the industrial process before it is emitted into the atmosphere using any convenient method. The CO may be a component of syngas gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen which can be produced from various sources. The CO produced from industrial processes is normally flared off to produce COand therefore the invention has particular utility in reducing COgreenhouse gas emissions and producing isopropanol and or acetone. Depending on the composition of the gaseous CO containing substrate it may also be desirable to treat it to remove any undesired impurities such as dust particles before introducing it to the fermentation. For example the gaseous substrate may be filtered or scrubbed using known methods.

It will be appreciated that for growth of the bacteria and fermentation of CO to the at least one product to occur in addition to the CO containing substrate gas a suitable liquid nutrient medium will need to be fed to the bioreactor. The substrate and media may be fed to the bioreactor in a continuous batch or batch fed fashion. A nutrient medium will contain vitamins and minerals sufficient to permit growth of the micro organism used. Anaerobic media suitable for fermentation to produce butanol using CO are known in the art. For example suitable media are described Biebel 2001 . In one embodiment of the invention the media is as described in the Examples section herein after.

The fermentation should desirably be carried out under appropriate conditions for the CO to the one or more product s fermentation to occur. Reaction conditions that should be considered include pressure temperature gas flow rate liquid flow rate media pH media redox potential agitation rate if using a continuous stirred tank reactor inoculum level maximum gas substrate concentrations to ensure that CO in the liquid phase does not become limiting and maximum product concentrations to avoid product inhibition.

In addition it is often desirable to increase the CO concentration of a substrate stream or CO partial pressure in a gaseous substrate and thus increase the efficiency of fermentation reactions where CO is a substrate. Operating at increased pressures allows a significant increase in the rate of CO transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase where it can be taken up by the micro organism as a carbon source for the production of the one or more products. This in turn means that the retention time defined as the liquid volume in the bioreactor divided by the input gas flow rate can be reduced when bioreactors are maintained at elevated pressure rather than atmospheric pressure. The optimum reaction conditions will depend partly on the particular micro organism of the invention used. However in general it is preferred that the fermentation be performed at pressure higher than ambient pressure. Also since a given CO to the one or more product s conversion rate is in part a function of the substrate retention time and achieving a desired retention time in turn dictates the required volume of a bioreactor the use of pressurized systems can greatly reduce the volume of the bioreactor required and consequently the capital cost of the fermentation equipment. According to examples given in U.S. Pat. No. 5 593 886 reactor volume can be reduced in linear proportion to increases in reactor operating pressure i.e. bioreactors operated at 10 atmospheres of pressure need only be one tenth the volume of those operated at 1 atmosphere of pressure.

By way of example the benefits of conducting a gas to ethanol fermentation at elevated pressures has been described. For example WO 02 08438 describes gas to ethanol fermentations performed under pressures of 30 psig and 75 psig giving ethanol productivities of 150 g l day and 369 g l day respectively. However example fermentations performed using similar media and input gas compositions at atmospheric pressure were found to produce between 10 and 20 times less ethanol per litre per day.

It is also desirable that the rate of introduction of the CO containing gaseous substrate is such as to ensure that the concentration of CO in the liquid phase does not become limiting. This is because a consequence of CO limited conditions may be that the ethanol product is consumed by the culture.

The composition of gas streams used to feed a fermentation reaction can have a significant impact on the efficiency and or costs of that reaction. For example O2 may reduce the efficiency of an anaerobic fermentation process. Processing of unwanted or unnecessary gases in stages of a fermentation process before or after fermentation can increase the burden on such stages e.g. where the gas stream is compressed before entering a bioreactor unnecessary energy may be used to compress gases that are not needed in the fermentation . Accordingly it may be desirable to treat substrate streams particularly substrate streams derived from industrial sources to remove unwanted components and increase the concentration of desirable components.

In certain embodiments a culture of a bacterium of the invention is maintained in an aqueous culture medium. Preferably the aqueous culture medium is a minimal anaerobic microbial growth medium. Suitable media are known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 173 429 and 5 593 886 and WO 02 08438 and as described in the Examples section herein after.

Acetone isopropanol or a mixed stream containing acetone and or isopropanol and or one or more other products may be recovered from the fermentation broth by methods known in the art such as fractional distillation or evaporation pervaporation gas stripping and extractive fermentation including for example liquid liquid extraction.

In certain preferred embodiments of the invention the one or more products are recovered from the fermentation broth by continuously removing a portion of the broth from the bioreactor separating microbial cells from the broth conveniently by filtration and recovering one or more products from the broth. Alcohols may conveniently be recovered for example by distillation. Acetone may be recovered for example by distillation. Any acids produced may be recovered for example by adsorption on activated charcoal. The separated microbial cells are preferably returned to the fermentation bioreactor. The cell free permeate remaining after any alcohol s and acid s have been removed is also preferably returned to the fermentation bioreactor. Additional nutrients such as B vitamins may be added to the cell free permeate to replenish the nutrient medium before it is returned to the bioreactor.

Also if the pH of the broth was adjusted as described above to enhance adsorption of acetic acid to the activated charcoal the pH should be re adjusted to a similar pH to that of the broth in the fermentation bioreactor before being returned to the bioreactor.

The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following non limiting examples.

Fermentations with DSM23693 were carried out in 1.5 L bioreactors at 37 C. and CO containing steel mill gas as sole energy and carbon source as described below. A defined medium was used containing per litre MgCl CaCl 0.5 mM KCl 2 mM HPO 5 mM Fe 100 M Ni Zn 5 M Mn B W Mo Se 2 M was prepared for culture growth.

After autoclaving the medium was supplemented with Thiamine Pantothenate 0.05 mg Biotin 0.02 mg and reduced with 3 mM Cysteine HCl. To achieve anaerobicity the reactor vessel was sparged with nitrogen through a 0.2 m filter. Prior to inoculation the gas was switched to CO containing steel mill gas feeding continuously to the reactor. The gas flow was initially set at 80 ml min increasing to 200 ml min during mid exponential phase while the agitation was increased from 200 rpm to 350. NaS was dosed into the bioreactor at 0.25 ml hr. Once the OD600 reached 0.5 the bioreactor was switched to a continuous mode at a rate of 1.0 ml min Dilution rate 0.96 d . Media samples were taken to measure the biomass and metabolites and a headspace analysis of the in and outflowing gas was performed on regular basis.

The injector was kept at 250 C. and helium with a constant flow of 1 ml min was used as carrier gas. The oven program was 40 C. for 5 min followed by an increase of 10 C. min up to 200 C. The temperature was then further increased to 220 C. with a rate of 50 C. min followed by a 5 min hold this temperature before the temperature was decreased to 40 C. with a rate of 50 C. min and a final 1 min hold. The FID was kept at 250 C. with 40 ml min hydrogen 450 ml min air and 15 ml min nitrogen as make up gas.

Measurements were carried out on a Varian CP 4900 micro GC with two installed channels. Channel 1 was a 10 m Mol sieve column running at 70 C. 200 kPa argon and a backflush time of 4.2 s while channel 2 was a 10 m PPQ column running at 90 C. 150 kPa helium and no backflush. The injector temperature for both channels was 70 C. Runtimes were set to 120 s but all peaks of interest would usually elute before 100 s.

The insert of the resulting plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc was completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 9 and results confirmed that the acetone biosynthesis genes and promoter region were free of mutations .

To confirm the functionality of the constructed plasmid a metabolic profile from a 5 ml overnight culture of ABLE K harbouring plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc were obtained using GC and HPLC confirming acetone production.

To investigate this further detailed growth experiments were carried out in triplicates with SD 8 minimal media containing 25 g ml chloramphenicol and XL 1 Blue MRF Kan carrying either plasmid pMTL 85147 negative control or expression plasmid pMTL 85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc . While no acetone production could be observed in the negative control an average maximum acetone production of 75.05 mg L with an average dry biomass of 1.44 g L was measured for the strain carrying the acetone plasmid.

Methylation of the acetone expression plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc was performed in vivo in using a synthesized hybrid Type II methyltransferase gene SEQ ID NO 35 designed from methyltransferase genes from and . The methyltransferase SEQ ID NO 34 was synthesized and fused with an inducible lac promoter in vector pGS20 ATG biosynthetics GmbH Merzhausen Germany SEQ ID NO 49 .

Both expression plasmid and methylation plasmid were transformed into same cells of restriction negative XL1 Blue MRF Kan which is possible due to their compatible Gram origins of replication high copy ColE1 in expression plasmid and low copy p15A in methylation plasmid . In vivo methylation was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and methylated plasmids were isolated using QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit QIAGEN GmbH Hilden Germany . The resulting mix was used for transformation experiments with DSM23693 and DSM 13528 but only the abundant high copy expression plasmid has a Gram replication origin repL allowing to replicate in Clostridia.

To make competent cells of DSM23693 and DSM 13528 a 50 ml culture PETC media Table 2 with steel mill gas and fructose as carbon source 37 C. was subcultured to fresh media for 3 consecutive days. These cells were used to inoculate 50 ml PETC media containing 40 mM DL threonine at an ODof 0.05. When the culture reached an ODof 0.4 the cells were transferred into an anaerobic chamber and harvested at 4 700 g and 4 C. The culture was twice washed with ice cold electroporation buffer 270 mM sucrose 1 mM MgCl2 7 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and finally suspended in a volume of 500 l fresh electroporation buffer. This mixture was transferred into a pre cooled electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap containing 1 g of the methylated plasmid mix. Since an additional Type I restriction system was identified in the genome of compared to 5 l of a Type I restriction inhibitor EPICENTRE Biotechnologies Madison Wis. 53713 USA were added to the plasmid mix which increased the transformation efficiency of by 2 10 fold. The cells were mixed with plasmid and restriction inhibitor and immediately pulsed using a Gene pulser Xcell electroporation system Bio Rad Labratories Hercules Calif. 94547 USA with the following settings 2.5 kV 600 and 25 F. Time constants were between 3.7 5.1 ms. For regeneration the culture was transferred in 5 ml special regeneration media Table 10 which increased recovery of the cells which was monitored at a wavelength of 600 nm using a Spectronic Helios Epsilon Spectrophotometer Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham Mass. 02454 USA equipped with a tube holder. Once growth was observed one doubling the cells were harvested suspended in 200 l fresh media and plated on selective PETC plates with 15 g ml thiamphenicol dissolved in 100 v v dimethylfuran DMF and 30 psi steel mill gas in the headspace. 50 200 colonies were visible after 4 6 days which were used to inoculate 2 ml PETC media containing 15 g ml thiamphenicol in DMF and fructose and 30 psi steel mill gas as carbon source. When growth occurred the culture was up scaled into 5 ml and later 50 ml PETC media containing each 15 g ml thiamphenicol in DMF and 30 psi steel mill gas in the headspace as sole carbon source.

To verify the DNA transfer a plasmid mini prep was performed from 10 ml culture volume using Zyppy plasmid miniprep kit Zymo Research Irvine Calif. 92614 USA . Since the quality of the isolated plasmid wasn t sufficient for a restriction digest due to Clostridial exonuclease activity Burchhardt G and D rre P Isolation and characterization of DNase deficient mutants of 1990 21 307 311 with the isolated plasmid as template using primers ctf adc cbei KpnI F Seq ID no 25 and ctf adc cbei BamHI R SEQ ID NO 26 to confirm the presence of the plasmid . PCR was carried out using iNtRON Maximise Premix PCR kit Intron Bio Technologies with the following conditions initial denaturation at 94 C. for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 94 C. for 20 seconds annealing 55 C. for 20 seconds and elongation 72 C. for 135 seconds before a final extension step 72 C. for 5 minutes .

To confirm the identity of the clones genomic DNA was isolated using the protocol given above from 50 ml cultures of each DSM23693 and DSM13528. A PCR was performed against the 16s rRNA gene using oligonucleotides fD1 SEQ ID NO 36 CCGAATTCGTCGACAACAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG and rP2 SEQ ID NO 37 CCCGGGATCCAAGCTTACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT Weisberg W G Barns S M Pelletier B A and Lane D J 16S ribosomal DNA amplification for phylogenetic study. 1990 173 697 703 and iNtRON Maximise Premix PCR kit Intron Bio Technologies Sangdaewon Joongwon Seognam Kyunggi Korea with the following conditions initial denaturation at 94 C. for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 94 C. for 20 seconds annealing 55 C. for 20 seconds and elongation 72 C. for 60 seconds before a final extension step 72 C. for 5 minutes .

All sequences obtained had 99.9 identity against the 16s rRNA gene rrsA of Y18178 GI 7271109 and respectively CP001666.1 GI 300433347 .

Growth experiments were carried out with transformed DSM23693 and DSM 13528 carrying plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc in 250 ml PETC media Table 2 without fructose and yeast extract in 1 l Schott bottles with rubber stoppers and 30 psi steel mill gas collected from New Zealand Steel site in Glenbrook NZ composition 44 CO 32 N 22 CO 2 H in the headspace as sole energy and carbon source. Acetone production was confirmed with both strains using HPLC and GC analysis. In Schott bottles acetone concentrations of around 0.3 g l 6.5 mM after 48 hours were achieved with both DSM23693 and DSM 13528 . Using appropriate conditions the produced acetone can then be further converted to isopropanol. Acetone production of 153 mg ml was also demonstrated on 30 psi biomass syngas Range Fuels Inc. Broomfield Colo. composition 29 CO 45 H 13 CH 12 CO 1 N as sole energy and carbon source in 50 ml PETC media Table 2 without fructose and yeast extract in serum bottles with DSM23693 .

qRT PCR experiments were performed to confirm successful expression of introduced genes thlA ctfA ctfB and adc leading to acetone production in and . Signals for all genes could successfully be detected .

A 50 ml culture of each and harbouring plasmid pMTL85147 harvested by centrifugation 6 000 g 5 min 4 C. snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. until RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated using PureLink RNA Mini Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. USA and eluted in 100 L of RNase free water. After DNase I treatment Roche Applied Science Indianapolis Ind. USA the reverse transcription step was then carried out using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. USA . RNA was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 Agilent Technologies Santa Clara Calif. USA Qubit Fluorometer Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. USA and by gel electrophoresis. A non RT control was performed for every primer pair. All qRT PCR reactions were performed in duplicates using a MyiQ Single Colour Detection System Bio Rad Labratories Carlsbad Calif. USA in a total reaction volume of 15 L with 25 ng of cDNA template 67 nM of each primer Table 17 and 1 iQ SYBR Green Supermix Bio Rad Labratories Carlsbad Calif. USA . The reaction conditions were 95 C. for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 C. for 15 s 55 C. for 15 s and 72 C. for 30 s. For detection of primer dimerisation or other artifacts of amplification a melting curve analysis was performed immediately after completion of the qPCR 38 cycles of 58 C. to 95 C. at 1 C. s . Two housekeeping genes Guanylate kinase and formate tetrahydrofolate ligase were included for each cDNA sample for normalization. Derivation of relative gene expression was conducted using Relative Expression Software Tool REST 2008 V2.0.7 38 . Dilution series of cDNA spanning 4 log units were used to generate standard curves and the resulting amplification efficiencies to calculate concentration of mRNA.

Acetone can be further converted to isopropanol by action of an alcohol dehydrogenase. However only few microorganisms such as NRRL B593 are described to produce isopropanol and acetone to isopropanol converting enzymes are very rare in nature. So far only two secondary alcohol dehydrogenases have been identified and described to date from NRRL B593 Ismaiel A A Zhu C X Colby G D Chen J S Purification and characterization of a primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from two strains of 1993 175 5097 5105 SEQ ID NO 38 39 and Peretz M and Burstein Y Amino acid sequence of alcohol dehydrogenase from the thermophilic bacterium 1989 28 6549 6555 SEQ ID NO 40 41 .

Therefore a collection of microorganisms acetogenic bacteria acetone and isopropanol producing Clostridia and were tested for their ability to convert acetone to isopropanol Table 11 .

All cultures were inoculated to an ODof 0.1 in 50 ml appropriate media containing a heterotrophic carbon source and 30 psi steel mill gas. The cultures were allowed to double OD 0.2 before acetone was added. A sample was taken and analyzed by HPLC and GC immediately after acetone addition and again at the end of growth which were followed by measuring the optical density . Results are summarized in Table 11. Blank media was used as negative control.

As expected isopropanol producing strain NRRL B593 George H A Johnson J L Moore W E C Holdeman L V Chen J S Acetone isopropanol and butanol production by syn. and 45 1160 1163 had the ability to reduce externally added acetone to isopropanol by action of its alcohol dehydrogenase. A different strain of NRCIMB8052 which lacks this enzyme wasn table to convert acetone to isopropanol as the acetone producing ATCC 824. The same is also true for

Surprisingly three carboxydotrophic acetogenic bacteria and which form a subcluster within the Clostridial rRNA Homology Group I were found to be able to convert acetone to isopropanol as well while all other acetogenic bacteria tested couldn t utilize acetone Table 11 . Conversion of different amounts of acetone to isopropanol by was then tested using different concentrations Table 12 .

A reactor study with DSM23693 was performed to demonstrate effective conversion of acetone to isopropanol at high rates. The reactor was set up as described above. Once in continuous mode with stable biomass and metabolite production acetone was added to both the bioreactor and the feed medium. Acetone was spiked into the reactor to a certain level which was then obtained by continuous feeding. Initially 1 g L acetone was added once the metabolite concentrations had stabilised the concentration was increased to 5 g L 15 g l and in a second experiment to 20 g L. Even at high concentrations of 20 g L the culture converted all acetone to isopropanol at high rate demonstrating that the identified primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase is highly effective .

To confirm that the conversion of acetone to isopropanol by is driven enzymatically enzyme assays were carried out with crude extract of 23693NRRL B593 and DSM15243 according to Ismaiel et al Ismaiel A A Zhu C X Colby G D Chen J S Purification and characterization of a primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from two strains of 1993 175 5097 5105 .

Crude extracts were obtained by sonication and lysozyme treatment 100 000 U ml of late exponential cultures. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and protein concentrations was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay reducing agent compatible Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham Mass. 02454 USA . The assay mixture 1 ml contained 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 1 mM dithiothreitol DTT and 0.2 mM NAD P H. The reaction was started by adding 10 mM of the substrate acetone from a 10 fold dilution in water and followed spectrophotometrically with a Spectramax M2 Molecular Devices Inc. Sunnyvale Calif. 94089 1136 USA at a wavelength of 365 nm. HO was used as negative control instead of crude extract and respectively acetone. Enzyme activity could be detected with crude extracts of both and and NADPH not with NADH but not with crude extracts of DSM15243 or HO with both NADPH and NADH . This demonstrates that the conversion of acetone to isopropanol by is driven enzymatically and as no activity was detected with NADH the enzyme appears to be NADPH dependent.

By sequencing and careful analysis a novel alcohol dehydrogenase gene enzyme was identified in all three strain and SEQ ID NO. 1 4 . The amino acid sequence was found to be identical in all three species and share some homology to the primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase of NRRL B593 87 and ATCC 53556 76 Table 13 . Compared to the well described secondary alcohol dehydrogenase of NRRL B593 Ismaiel A A Zhu C X Colby G D Chen J S Purification and characterization of a primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from two strains of 1993 175 5097 5105 a total of 49 amino acids exchanges were found. 4 amino acids of the catalytic centre of the protein are conserved however other amino acids in the catalytic domain are not . A motif search predicted the novel alcohol dehydrogenase gene enzyme to be zinc and NAD P H dependent. The respective genes coding for the novel alcohol dehydrogenase was found to be 98 identical within the 3 species and but only 82 identical to the one from and 72 identical to the one from Table 14 .

To identify if the gene encoding the novel alcohol dehydrogenase is active during a normal fermentation with as well as identifying potential promoter regions for gene overexpression a qRT PCR study with a over 250 genes was performed.

Samples were taken from a typical 1.5 l fed batch fermentation run as described above over the whole growth 4 days . The samples were harvested by centrifugation 6 000 g 5 min 4 C. and the cell pellet snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. until use. RNA was isolated by thawing the cell pellet on ice and suspending it in 100 L of lysozyme solution 50 000 U lysozyme 0.5 L 10 SDS 10 mM Tris HCl 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8 . After 5 min 350 L of lysis buffer containing 10 L of 2 mercaptoethanol was added. The cell suspension was mechanistically disrupted by passing five times through an 18 21 gauge needle. RNA was then isolated using PureLink RNA Mini Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. 92008 USA and eluted in 100 L of RNase free water. The RNA was checked via PCR and gel electrophoresis and quantified spectrophotometrically and treated with DNase I Roche if necessary. The reverse transcription step was carried out using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. 92008 USA . RT PCR reactions were performed in MyiQ Single Colour Real Time PCR Detection System Bio Rad Labratories Hercules Calif. 94547 USA in a reaction volume of 15 L with 25 ng of cDNA template 67 nM of each primer Table 15 and 1 iQ SYBR Green Supermix Bio Rad Labratories Hercules Calif. 94547 USA . Guanylate kinase GnK and formate tetrahydrofolate ligase FoT4L were used as housekeeping gene and non template controls were included. The reaction conditions were 95 C. for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 C. for 15 s 55 C. for 15 s and 72 C. for 30 s. A melting curve analysis was performed immediately after completion of the qRT PCR 38 cycles of 58 C. to 95 C. at 1 C. s for detection of primer dimerisation or other artifacts of amplification. Data on the expression level was computed in the form of threshold cycle C values based on PCR base line subtracted curve fit method as calculated by the Biorad iQ5 2.0 software. The raw Cvalues were further analyzed using Relative Expression Software Tool REST 2008 V2.0.7.

The result of the qRT PCR study showed that the gene for the novel alcohol dehydrogenase is expressed over the whole growth on a relatively constant level and only ceases at end of growth . Compared to over 200 genes chosen from every part of the metabolism the alcohol dehydrogenase gene belongs to the top 50 expressed genes. The highest gene expression of all genes analyzed showed the genes of the Wood Ljungdahl operon with an mRNA level of more than 10 fold higher than the alcohol dehydrogenase gene . The respective promoter SEQ ID NO 22 region is therefore ideal to over express genes such as the genes for acetone biosynthesis enzymes and an alcohol dehydrogenase gene although in the case of over expression of an alcohol dehydrogenase gene native to the micro organisms it may require additional genetic modification to ensure sufficient co factor availability. This could include for example over expression of further genes to increase the NADPH pool such as transhydrogenase elimination of competing NADPH consuming reactions or protein engineering to change the co factor requirement to NADH. Other useful promoter regions identified for gene over expression include the promoter region of FF ATPase operon SEQ ID NO 51 Rnf complex operon SEQ ID NO 52 and Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase SEQ ID NO 53 .

Isopropanol Production from CO and CO Hby and with Expression Plasmid Containing Clostridial Acetone Genes

The 250 ml Schott bottle cultures of recombinant strains of DSM23693 and DSM 13528 carrying acetone expression plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc were shown to produce acetone but no isopropanol could be detected . This might be due to the lack of reducing power at end of growth due to the given static conditions in Schott bottles where CO gets depleted from the headspace and is not constantly fed like in a fed batch or continuous fermentation process. Reducing equivalents such as NAD P H or ferredoxin gets generated from CO but are also consumed for ethanol production which already occurs during exponential and early stationary growth. At this point is the concentration of produced acetone which is needed as precursor for isopropanol production is still relatively low.

Therefore both cultures were re gassed with 30 psi fresh steel mill gas after 48 h of growth and also re inoculated. While biomass didn t increase much further some of the produced acetone got converted into isopropanol within 24 hours Table 16 .

In a fermentation system with constant supply of CO sufficient reducing power is present for continuous production of isopropanol from CO or CO Hand both acetone and isopropanol were produced in a respective fermentation run with C. autoethanogenum DSM23693 carrying acetone expression plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc.

The novel alcohol dehydrogenase was cloned into the acetone expression plasmid and put under control of the Wood Ljungdahl promoter for gene over expression and test of functionality in

Alcohol dehydrogenase was amplified from isolated C. autoethanogenum DSM10061 chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotides SecAdh SalI F SEQ ID NO 54 TATTTGTCGACTTAGGAGGTTCTATTATGAAAGG and SecAdh XhoI R SEQ ID NO 55 AAAACTCGAGACATTTTTTTAATGCGACAG . The 1129 bp PCR fragment was cloned into plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc using SalI and XhoI and XL 1 Blue MRF Kan. The resulting plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc adh SEQ ID NO 48 was completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 9 and results confirmed that the isopropanol biosynthesis genes and promoter region were free of mutations .

To further test the functionality of the novel alcohol dehydrogenase from C. autoethanogenum growth experiments were carried out using XL 1 Blue MRF Kan expressing only the acetone biosynthesis genes carrying plasmid pMTL 85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc and expressing the acetone biosynthesis genes plus the novel alcohol dehydrogenase carrying plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc adh in 100 ml SD 8 minimal media with chloramphenicol .

While no isopropanol could be detected with the strain carrying the acetone plasmid an average maximum of 32.7 mg L isopropanol was measured with the strain additionally expressing the novel alcohol dehydrogenase from

In addition to the Clostridial acetone and isopropanol pathway two enzymes an Alpha ketoisovalerate decarboxylase KivD from and an Alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from Table 18 were identified that confer activity towards acetone and isopropanol production in . Those two enzymes haven t been reported to be involved in acetone or isopropanol production or have catalytic functions on any of the precursors in the Clostridial acetone and isopropanol pathway. Heterologous expression of these proteins in Atsumi et al. 2008. Non fermentative pathways for synthesis of branched chain higher alcohols as biofuels. Nature 451 86 90 or other organisms like Blombach et al. 2011. tailored for efficient Isobutanol production. 77 3300 10 or Higashide W. et al. 2011. Metabolic Engineering of cellulolyticum for Production of Isobutanol from Cellulose. 77 2727 33 led to production of branched chain higher alcohols like isobutanol 1 butanol 2 methyl 1 butanol 3 methyl 1 butanol and 2 phenylethanol from amino acid precursors but neither acetone nor isobutanol was reported. Expression of codon optimized Alpha ketoisovalerate decarboxylase KivD from alone or a combination of codon optimized Alpha ketoisovalerate decarboxylase KivD from and an Alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from in however led suprisingly to production of acetone and isopropanol.

The Alpha ketoisovalerate decarboxylase decarboxylase KivD from and Alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from Table 18 were codon optimised by ATG Biosynthetics GmbH Merzhausen Germany and flanked by NdeI and KpnI restriction sites for further sub cloning. The Phosphiotransacetylase Acetate kinase operon promoter of was used for expression of target genes. All DNA sequences used are given in Table 19.

The promoter region of the phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase operon P was amplified using primers Ppta ack NotI F Seq. ID. No. 80 GAGCGGCCGCAATATGATATTTATGTCC and Ppta ack NdeI R Seq. ID. No. 81 TTCCATATGTTTCATGTTCATTTCCTCC and cloned into the shuttle vector pMTL 85141 FJ797651.1 Nigel Minton University of Nottingham UK Heap J T Pennington O J Cartman S T Minton N P.

The created plasmid pMTL85245 Seq. ID. No. 80 and the 2746 bp codon optimised product of the decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 gene cluster were both cut with NdeI and KpnI. A ligation was transformed into XL1 Blue MRF Kan resulting in plasmid pMTL85245 kivd adh2 Seq. ID. No. 83 . The insert of the resulting plasmid pMTL85245 kivd adh was completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 20 and results confirmed that genes and promoter region were free of mutations.

The kivD gene alone was amplified using primer pair M13 Reverse Seq. ID. 57 CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC and Adh seqR1 Seq. ID. 85 Table 16 . The 2635 bp PCR fragment of KivD was cloned into the shuttle vector pMTL 85245 using NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites and strain XL1 Blue MRF Kan creating plasmid pMTL85245 kivd Seq. ID No. 84 . The insert of the resulting plasmid pMTL85245 kivd was completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 20 and results confirmed that the acetone biosynthesis gene was free of mutations.

Constructed expression plasmids pMTL85245 kivd adh2 and pMTL85245 kivd were transformed into strain JW3350 2 and prepared for transformation in DSM23693 which was performed as described above. While in harbouring the two plasmids neither acetone nor isopropanol could be detected but higher branched chain alcohols such as isobutanol as described in the literature in both acetone and isopropanol could be detected. In serum bottle experiments highest isopropanol concentrations from CO containing steel mill gas were 0.050 0.064 g L for both expression plasmids .

Production of Acetone and Isopropanol with a Combination of Clostridial Pathway Genes and Alpha Ketoisovalerate Decarboxylase KivD from and Alcohol Dehydrogenase Adh2 from

Without wanting to be bound by any particular theory the inventors believe that the codon optimized alpha ketoacid decarboxylase Kivd from has activity converting acetoacetate to acetone as the Clostridial acetoacetate decarboxylase while the codon optimized alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from have activity converting acetone to isopropanol as the novel primary secondary alcohol dehydrogenase identified or the primary secondary alcohol dehydrogease from . To test this hypothesis several combinations of Clostridial acetone isopropanol pathway genes and the alpha ketoacid decarboxylase Kivd from and alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2 from have been created and tested within and demonstrating production of acetone and isopropanol.

Based on the constructed expression plasmids pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc pMTL85245 kivd adh2 and pMTL85245 kivd new combinations were constructed.

The insert of the resulting plasmid pMTL83147 thlA ctfAB adc adh2 was completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 9 and 20 and results confirmed that the fragment was mutation free. Oligonucleotides P kivd adh F Seq. ID. No. 99 ATATTGGATCCACAGCTATGACCGCGGCCGCAATATG and P kivd adh R Seq. ID. No. 100 AGCGTCCATGGCCTTATTTACTTGTATCTACAACATATC were used to amplify a 3266 bp PCR fragment of P kivd adhfrom plasmid pMTL85245 kivd adh2 which was then cloned into the plasmid pMTL85147 thlA ctfAB adc using BamHI and NcoI restriction sites and strain XL1 Blue MRF Kan creating plasmid pMTL83147 thlA ctfAB adc P kivd adh2 Seq. ID. 101 .

The insert of the resulting plasmid pMTL83147 thlA ctfAB adc P kivd adhwas completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 9 and results confirmed that the plasmid was free of mutations.

Methylation of the newly constructed expression plasmids pMTL85147 thlA ctfA ctfB adc pMTL83147 thlA ctfAB adc adh2 and pMTL83147 thlA ctfAB adc P kivd adhwere performed in vivo in using a synthesized hybrid Type II methyltransferase gene SEQ ID NO 35 designed from methyltransferase genes from and and transformed into DSM23693 as described above.

All plasmid construct were tested in and DSM23693 using serum bottle experiments with sugar or CO containing steel mill gas as sole substrate. With all combinations tested acetone and isopropanol production was measured when expressed heterologously in while in acetone production only occurred with few combinations and an alcohol dehydrogenase gene was needed for isopropanol production Table 21 . The results presented show that both in as well as the codon optimized Alpha ketoacid decarboxylase Kivd from is able to replace the Clostridial acetoacetate decarboxylase and catalyse the conversion of acetoacetate to acetone .

Conversion of acetic acid to other products such as ethanol via aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase AOR or back to acetyl CoA via phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase Pta Ack or AMP dependent acetyl CoA synthase Acs is unfavourable since it requires energy in the form of reduced ferredoxin or ATP Wolfe A J The acetate switch. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev 2005 69 12 50 . This invention presents a novel mode of acetic acid detoxification in acetogenic bacteria which is free of energy requirement. Acetic acid can get recycled back to acetyl CoA via a Acetoacetyl CoA Acetate Butyrate Coenzyme A transferase system consisting of Acetyl Coenzyme A acetyltransferase Acetoacetyl CoA Acetate Butyrate Coenzyme A transferase A Acetoacetyl CoA Acetate Butyrate Coenzyme A transferase B. This reaction drives the conversion of Acetoacetyl CoA to Acetoacetate which can then get decarboxylated to acetone and reduced to isopropanol .

Metabolites concentrations were measured using Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a RID operated at 35 C. Refractive Index Detector and an Alltech IOA 2000 Organic acid column 150 6.5 mm particle size 5 m kept at 60 C. The presence of Acetone and Isopropanol was also measured using Agilent 6890N headspace GC equipped with a Supelco PDMS 100 1 cm fiber an Alltech EC 1000 30 m 0.25 mm 0.25 m column and a flame ionization detector FID . The composition of the gas inflows and outflows was measured using a Varian CP 4900 micro GC with two installed channels. Channel 1 was a 10 m Mol sieve column running at 70 C. 200 kPa argon and a backflush time of 4.2 s while channel 2 was a 10 m PPQ column running at 90 C. 150 kPa helium and no backflush. The injector temperature for both channels was 70 C. Sampling of metabolites was performed daily. Gas analysis was automated and measured hourly.

The growth and metabolite profile of DSM23693 carrying the vector pMTL83147 thl ctfAB adc adh2 in a continuous fermentation over 31 days is shown in . The fermentation ran as a batch fermentation from inoculation to day 6. At day 7 the fermentation was switched to continuous fermentation. The increase in acetate concentration coupled with a decrease in ethanol concentration during continuous fermentation seems to have triggered a significant increase in isopropanol production. highlights this result where the isopropanol production rate follows a similar trend to the acetate production rate and demonstrates an Isopropanol production rate of 0.7 g per litre per day. shows the Isopropanol concentration over the 31 day period with the concentration reaching a level of 0.250 g per litre. A GC sample was taken during the run at day 19. shows the GC results for the sample showing the production of both acetone and Isopropanol during the fermentation. The acetone peak was relatively small in comparison with the Isopropanol peak demonstrating the conversion of acetone through to Isopropanol while there is acetone in the system.

Fermentations with DSM23693 carrying the vector pMTL83147 thl ctfAB adc adh2 were carried out in 1.5 L bioreactors at 37 C. and CO containing steel mill gas. The fermenter was fed with corex gas 40 CO 15 H2 15 CO2 30 N2 as sole energy and carbon source as described below. A defined medium was used containing per litre MgCl CaCl 0.5 mM KCl 3 mM HPO 5 mM Fe 100 M Ni Zn 5 M Mn B W Mo Se 2 M was prepared for culture growth. The media was transferred into the bioreactor and autoclaved at 121 C. for 45 minutes. After autoclaving the medium was supplemented with Thiamine Pantothenate 0.05 mg Biotin 0.02 mg and reduced with 3 mM Cysteine HCl. To achieve anaerobic conditions the reactor vessel was sparged with nitrogen through a 0.2 m filter.

Prior to inoculation the gas was switched to CO containing steel mill gas feeding continuously to the reactor. The gas flow was initially set at 100 ml min increasing to 350 ml min during mid exponential phase while the agitation was increased from 600 rpm to 850 rpm. A solution of 0.5M of NaS was dosed into the bioreactor at 0.25 ml hr. Once the OD600 reached 0.5 the bioreactor was switched to a continuous mode at a rate of 1.0 ml min Dilution rate 0.96 d . At the same time cells were concentrated up in the fermenter by using a polysulfon membrane filtration system with 0.1 m pore size GE healthcare hallow fibre membrane . The rate of permeate withdrawing was the same as the medium feeding rate. For the microbes it was a batch culture. Media samples were taken to measure the biomass and metabolites and a headspace analysis of the in and outflowing gas was performed on regular basis.
