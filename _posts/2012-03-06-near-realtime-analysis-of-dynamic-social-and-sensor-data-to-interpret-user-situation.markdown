The present invention relates generally to electronic content. More particularly the present invention relates to the near real time analysis of dynamic social and sensor data to interpret user situation to better recommend electronic content.

The amount of electronic content especially online content has undergone an explosion in recent years mostly due to the rise in prevalence of the Internet. This explosion further exacerbates the frustrations of already overwhelmed consumers since the majority of the content and information is irrelevant to a particular user at a particular moment. More than ever before consumers are longing for a solution that would put the information they need or things they like at their fingertips when they need them. On the other hand businesses have accumulated an astronomical amount of data detailing consumers online activities. It is commonly recognized that mining the data to understand consumers interests and sentiments can enable better targeted marketing and advertisement.

The main weakness of prior art mining techniques is their blindness about the user s situation. At a particular moment what a user needs or likes and what is appropriate to suggest to the user can be highly variable based upon the user s situation. For example even though a user may like good wine suggesting going to a wine tasting nearby may not be a good idea when his friends with him at the time do not like wine. In another example a user may enjoy going to theaters visiting museums and hiking but which of these activities to suggest may depend greatly on the weather the users mood and on whether of her friends who share a same interest are available.

While improving recommendation is important on any computing platform it is especially important for devices with small form factors such as mobile phones due to small display areas lower processing speed and more limited user input.

Longer term interests of a user can be inferred based on a user s historical interests physical behavior virtual behavior such as online shopping patterns etc. However determining a user s current situation in terms of his or her current activity location emotion etc. to infer his or her potential shorter term needs would be quite valuable.

In a first embodiment of the present invention a method of interpreting a situation of a user of an electronic device is provided comprising gathering social data related to the user monitoring one or more physical sensors on the electronic device in order to gather physical data related to the user mapping structured data in the social data and the physical data to internal data types extracting features from unstructured social data identifying attributes related to the features obtaining values for the identified attributes interpreting movement of the user by examining the physical data and detecting a situation of the user by fusing the movement of the user with the identified attributes of the features of the unstructured social data and features of structured social data.

In a second embodiment of the present invention an electronic device is provided comprising one or more physical sensors one or more physical sensor monitors configured to monitor the one or more physical sensors and output data mapped to internal data types one or more social data monitors configured to monitor social interaction from the electronic device and output at least unstructured social data a feature extractor coupled to the one or more social data monitors and configured to extract features from the unstructured social data a semantic analyzer coupled to the feature extractor and configured to identify attributes related to the features and obtain values for the identified attributes a sensor fusion and abstraction module coupled to the one or more physical sensor modules and configured to interpret movement of a user of the electronic device by examining the physical data a situation detector coupled to the semantic analyzer and sensor fusion and abstraction module and configured to detect a situation of the user by fusing the movement of the user with the identified attributes of the features of the unstructured social data and features of structured social data.

Reference will now be made in detail to specific embodiments of the invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. On the contrary it is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the following description specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In addition well known features may not have been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the invention.

In accordance with the present invention the components process steps and or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems programming languages computing platforms computer programs and or general purpose machines. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature such as hardwired devices field programmable gate arrays FPGAs application specific integrated circuits ASICs or the like may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. The present invention may also be tangibly embodied as a set of computer instructions stored on a computer readable medium such as a memory device.

The present invention provides a solution where a user s situation is interpreted in near real time in order to better analyze his or her short term needs. The user situation can be output in terms of various attributes such as current activity location emotional state time of day etc. This interpretation and resulting output can be achieved by fusion abstractions and analysis of data from multiple sources.

A situation may be defined as the values of a set of variables that affect and sometimes determine a user s preference behaviors and decision making. Generally speaking a situation can be defined by one or more of the following categories of variables 1 variables that define a physical environment e.g. location time weather sound lighting etc. 2 variables that define a social circumstance e.g. people around the user category of venue the user is in etc. 3 variables that define a user state e.g. mood emotion heart rate blood pressure glucose level etc. and 4 variables that define user activity e.g. physical activities such as walking driving sleeping dancing etc. and online activities such as email phone calls shopping social networking web surfing viewing and interacting with content etc. .

Not all variables need to be used in defining a situation. Roughly speaking which variables are important in defining situations will vary from one application domain to another application domain. For example selecting a piece of music to listen to could mainly depend on the user s mood activity and people around while other variables are less important or not important at all. What variables are important can also vary from one user to another. For example for one user weather may be an important factor in deciding what activity to perform but not for other users.

The sources from which data can be obtained in order to perform this analysis can vary. In one embodiment of the present invention physical sensors on the user s device such as a GPS module accelerometer microphone camera etc. can be used. Data from such sensors may include raw data readings or abstracted data. This data can provide useful hints about a user s physical context such as the user s physical movement pattern or activity and physical locations. Raw sensor readings can be interpreted into a higher level abstraction such as running walking moving shaking etc.

In another embodiment data from social applications can be used to provide useful hints about a user s social context. This may include examining a user s social circles including friends colleagues and others who may influence the user the most. This may also include examining social experiences such as endorsements reviews dislikes etc. This may also include examining a user s social interests such as groups products activities etc. This may also include examining a user s lifestyle such as whether they are active eco friendly etc. based on a user s experiences interests activities.

Indeed any social applications configured by the user including social networking sites and personal information management applications such as contacts calendar email texting etc. can be used as a source of data. The data from such applications can include but is not limited to content posts updates notifications etc. Some of this data is relatively static such as contacts and calendar entries. Other of this data is dynamic such as posts updates notifications text messages etc.

The present invention focuses on interpreting the user s situation through fusion and abstraction of dynamic data including various sensor data plus social data as well as some static data. The user s situation can then be expressed using a variety of attributes such as user activity location emotional state the current time the occasion event the user is participating in people around the user etc.

A feature extractor receives new data from the non hardware sensor monitors such as text data from text messages and social networking interactions. It then extracts named entities and significant topics from the text. Natural language programming techniques such as named entity extraction can be applied to extract names of people places etc. Frequency based metrics such as term frequency inverse document frequency TF IDF can be applied to measure the importance of words and phrases and extract significant topics. TF IDF is statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. Furthermore an aging scheme could be applied to assign variable weights to keywords and features depending on the time of their occurrence.

A semantic analyzer can then receive named entities from the feature extractor and structured data from monitors . Such data may include named entities and significant topics from the feature extractor and names of events places people activity etc. from other sources. When it receives new data it can identify additional attributes related to the received data using a schema or ontology. It then can further retrieve values for each related attribute if the value is not already available through one or more sources such as a search engine or online database of entities. For example if the semantic analyzer is given EVENT name U2 Concert it can identify name attendees venue date type of event etc. as attributes of an EVENT and retrieve values for each of those attributes e.g. venue Oakland Arena type music concert .

A sensor fusion and abstraction module receives raw sensor readings from monitors of physical sensors such as accelerometers GPS modules microphones etc. and interprets the sensor readings into movements of the user such as walking rhythmic movement etc. This may include applying classification techniques such as Na ve Bayesian Classification Support Vector Machines Hidden Marcov Model decision trees etc.

A situation analyzer then receives data from the feature extractor semantic analyzer sensor fusion and abstraction module and monitors . Such data can include named entities along with relevant attributes and structured data. When it receives new data it can analyze the combined data together and attempt to create a complete picture of the user s situation in terms of one or more of the following attributes event in which the user is currently participating people around the user location of the user activity of the user and emotion of the user. All of these attributes are real time or at least near real time attempting to gain a picture of the user s situation right now.

This may be achieved by applying custom rule based classification techniques. Rules that specify which data source and what kind of data sequence and attributes should be given higher weights for each type of data that needs to be derived can be created. Using such rules based on the source sequence and relative weights of incoming data a final weight for a particular data received from multiple sources is calculated and values with a weight greater than a set threshold possibly configurable by the developer is considered to be an attribute of the user s situation. For example for an EVENT data type a rule such as the following may be specified EVENT information from calendar entries and named entities should be assigned higher weight. It should be noted that in some embodiments rather than using custom rule based classification techniques classification algorithms such as Na ve Bayesian Support Vector Machines Hidden Markov models etc. can be used to analyze and classify sensor and social data from varied sources. The first step in that case would be collect or record data using a text system and trial user and make available such data for training the classification algorithms.

The output of the situation analyzer can be further used for a wide variety of applications including advertising automatic social updates recommendation etc.

It should be noted that the intervals at which the various processing components of the system can process the newly received data is configurable. For example the situation analyzer may run every 30 minutes to estimate the user s current situation every 30 minutes.

At one or more physical sensors on the electronic device are monitored in order to gather physical data related to the user. The monitoring may be performed on a periodic basis. At structured data in the social data and the physical data is mapped to internal data types. At features are extracted from unstructured social data. At attributes related to the features are identified. At values are obtained for the identified attributes. At movement of the user is detected by examining the physical data. At a situation of the user is detected by fusing the movement of the user with the values for the identified attributes of the features of the unstructured social data. This detection can include applying custom rule based filtering a prioritization techniques to the movement of the user and the values for the identified attributes of the features of the unstructured social data. The custom rule based filtering can include specifying rules indicating which data sources sequences types and attributes should be assigned a higher weight.

At the end of the process a user situation has been identified. Due to the near real time analysis of this situation the situation can then be utilized to make recommendations or perform other actions that can help in addressing a user s short term need i.e. what the user needs right now .

In summary the present invention allows for making use of dynamic social data and updates in order to derive a user s current situation. This is a simple and practical methodology that enables near real time processing and analysis. Processing is able to be performed on a mobile device without the need for a cloud or remote server. It is a unique way to represent a user s situation at a particular moment in terms of current location activity event surrounding people and emotions.

Furthermore embodiment of the disclosed method and system for displaying multimedia content on multiple electronic display screens can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both software and hardware elements.

The term computer readable medium is used generally to refer to media such as main memory secondary memory removable storage hard disks flash memory disk drive memory CD ROM and other forms of persistent memory. It should be noted that program storage devices as may be used to describe storage devices containing executable computer code for operating various methods of the present invention shall not be construed to cover transitory subject matter such as carrier waves or signals.
