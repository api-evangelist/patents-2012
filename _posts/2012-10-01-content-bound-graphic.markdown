Various types of devices can render content to a display or displays. For example a mobile phone a tablet device a notebook computer a desktop computer etc. may render content to a display e.g. which may be integral or otherwise operatively connected . Various technologies and techniques described herein pertain to technology for display of content.

A method can include accessing content stored in a data store where the content includes a bound and content adjacent to the bound rendering a portion of the content to a display receiving a scroll command that calls for rendering the content adjacent to the bound and responsive to receipt of the scroll command rendering a bound graphic. Various other apparatuses systems methods etc. are also disclosed.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing general principles of various implementations. The scope of invention should be ascertained with reference to issued claims.

As mentioned various types of devices can render content to a display. As an example consider an application executable by a processor of a device that calls for rendering of content by the device to a display. In such an example depending on the amount type etc. of the content at least a portion of the content may be fit to the display. For example consider a webpage with 10 000 words accessed by a tablet device having a diagonal screen size of about 9 inches. For the given screen size about 200 to about 400 words may be considered acceptable for a user to read the words. In such an example if a page size is assumed to be 200 words the 10 000 words of the webpage would fill 50 pages. Where a scroll control exists for the device a user may actuate the scroll control to cause the device to access certain portions of the content e.g. page back page forward etc. and render it to the display.

The foregoing example may be considered to be somewhat freeform as to how the content is provided or organized. As an example where the scroll control is a touch screen a user may successively touch the touch screen with swiping motions to call for rendering of portions of content forward or reverse from currently displayed content. In such an example a user may abruptly reach a bound for the content or a portion thereof. A bound may be for example due to end of the content e.g. end of the 10 000 words due to end of content in local memory e.g. only 2 000 of 10 000 words downloaded into local memory etc. An abrupt end e.g. a bound hit may be detrimental to a user s experience. Various techniques technologies etc. described herein may improve a user s experience for example by calling for rendering of a bound graphic. Such a graphic may be readily noticeable and provide a user with an indication that an end of content e.g. a bound has been reached.

As an example a device may include bound circuitry that may for example be implemented with respect to an application as a component of the application e.g. part of application code a plug in etc. . As an example bound circuitry may be implemented as a shell in which content is directed for rendering or co rendering. As an example bound circuitry may be provided as a module for implementation with a framework such as an operating system framework.

As an example of an operating system framework consider the WINDOWS 8 operating system framework Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. which includes features for a style of application referred to as Windows Store apps or Metro apps e.g. Metro style apps . The aforementioned framework intends to allow such apps to provide a fast and fluid user experience e.g. optimization for touchscreen environments smaller scope in relation to desktop applications etc. . As to user access to such apps some may be distributed and updated through a distribution platform e.g. Windows Store App Store Google Play etc. for example which may be associated with one or more operating systems e.g. Apple OSs Google OSs etc. .

As to the aforementioned WINDOWS framework apps may run within a set of application programming interfaces APIs known as the Windows Runtime WinRT e.g. with support of various programming languages scripts etc. such as C C VB.NET C HTML5 JavaScript etc. .

In the scenarios A and B of a portion of the content is rendered to the display . In the example of the content pertains to a support application which can include items of content where the number of items e.g. arranged in columns does not readily fit the display e.g. according to device settings application settings etc. . While the example of shows items in columns in a landscape orientation other arrangements are possible such as rows in portrait or landscape orientations columns in a portrait orientation combinations of rows and columns etc.

As shown in the example of the portion of the content rendered to the display is adjacent to a bound e.g. an end of the content . In the scenario A a user scrolling through the content e.g. entering commands that cause scrolling to the right causes rendering of the content adjacent to the bound. In scenario A the user may arrive at that bound abruptly which may be detrimental to the user s experience. In the scenario B the bound circuitry causes rendering of a bound graphic to the display that serves as a visual indicator to the user that a bound of the content has been reached. As an example where a device changes orientation bound circuitry or other circuitry may automatically change orientation of a bound graphic e.g. optionally along with one or more settings which may be associated with orientation related controls etc. .

As an example the bound graphic may be a color graphic. As an example a color graphic may be red. As an example a color may be determined for a color graphic by the bound circuitry responsive to one or more colors intensities etc. of the content or portion thereof being rendered to the display . For example if the portion of the content adjacent to a bound has a red background the bound circuitry may select a color other than red for the bound graphic . For example the bound circuitry may include a color table. As an example the bound circuitry may include a model e.g. optionally a color table one or more functions etc. . As an example the bound circuitry may include a model to select a complementary color to a color of content adjacent to a bound of the content. Complementary colors may be defined as pairs of colors that are of opposite hue in some color model. The exact hue complementary to a given hue may depend on the model in question and perceptually uniform additive and subtractive color models for example have differing complements for a given color. As an example bound circuitry may include a default color for a bound graphic and an algorithm to determine whether to call for rendering of a different color e.g. depending on contrast with respect to one or more complementary parameters etc. .

As an example the bound graphic may include shading hatching transparency etc. In the example of the hatching may represent a color shading or other visual effect. As an example a bound graphic may be active with respect to time. For example a bound graphic may be rendered with a snap effect e.g. a shifting back and forth with respect to time a stretch effect e.g. an increase in pixel width or other time effect. As an example a bound graphic may include a visual effect within the graphic itself e.g. color change intensity change etc. . As to time related effects rates maxima minima etc. may be parameters of bound circuitry which may be set by a user an application etc. As an example rate of a time related effect may correspond to rate of an input signal such as a swipe input on a touch control e.g. display touchpad etc. .

As an example a bound graphic may be a graphical user interface GUI . For example the bound graphic may allow for selection via a tap a click a voice command etc. which calls for one or more actions. As an example an action may be issuance of a call for additional content e.g. a next book chapter a next magazine article a next day in a journal a next thread in a forum etc. .

In the example of the bound circuitry includes bound X parameters content parameters and bound X parameters . As an example a bound parameter may specify a shape of a bound graphic a bound action etc. For example the bound X parameters may include a pixel width parameter and a color parameter. As to the content parameters these may comport with the view circuitry for example to specify an array e.g. a pixel array that may be available for viewing of content. As an example the view circuitry may include one or more grids. In such an example the bound circuitry may specify one or more parameter values with respect to a grid or grids.

The foregoing code given as an example of certain technologies implements a window control a grid control and a scroll control as well as defines various parameter values related to such controls. The foregoing code references XAML which is an extensible application markup language. In the WINDOWS 8 framework XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime object instances while XAML attributes map to Common Language Runtime properties and events on those objects. In the WINDOWS 8 framework a ScrollViewer class includes a constructor e.g. to initialize an instance of the ScrollViewer class events methods e.g. including methods related to inertia and properties. In the WINDOWS 8 framework a GridView class includes a constructor e.g. to initialize an instance of the GridView class events methods and properties. In the example of the view circuitry may include one or more features of the aforementioned GridView class and the scroll circuitry may include one or more features of the ScrollViewer class.

As an example bound circuitry may include a scroll control e.g. ScrollViewer control etc. within a grid control e.g. a GridView control etc. . In such an example properties associated with the scroll control may include style e.g. horizontal or vertical name e.g. MainScrollViewer content e.g. grid columns grid rows etc. . As an example consider content properties for a grid control that includes 3 columns 

Column1 color bar 500 pixels wide e.g. 10 pixels visible by setting a negative 490 pixel margin to cause display of the bar as being solid instead of a line when a user scrolls past a beginning bound of content 

Column2 Specific page content e.g. optionally configured to changes for each page of content for an application and

Column3 color bar 500 pixels wide e.g. 10 pixels visible by setting a negative 490 pixel margin to cause display of the bar as being solid instead of a line when a user scrolls past an end bound of content .

As an example bound circuitry may include one or more parameters to specify values for properties such as inertia snap back etc. As an example bound circuitry may adopt one or more property values from an application e.g. or default settings to provide a more uniform user experience e.g. overall look feel etc. . As to color bound circuitry may optionally adopt a color palette scheme etc. of an application to provide a more uniform user experience. For example as to Columns 1 and 3 in the above example the color of the color bars may be selected to conform to an overall look of an application. As an example bound circuitry may specify a color such as red where a closest match to red is selected from a color scheme of an application for use as a color of a color bar bound graphic. As another example where an application calls for display of red e.g. as a background color bound circuitry may select a complementary color such as green e.g. to enhance visual impact of a bound graphic .

In the example of a portion of content is shown as being rendered to the display along with a bound graphic . As an example the flash memory may store content such that the processing circuitry can access one or more portions of the stored content responsive to one or more instructions input via the touch screen controller and received via the SPI and display an accessed portion of the content to the display e.g. via the display controller . As an example where the accessed portion of the content is adjacent to a bound of the content the circuitry of the device may call for rendering of the bound graphic and perform rendering of the bound graphic to the display .

In the example of the flash memory may have a capacity for example in a range of megabytes to gigabytes. For example a tablet device may include flash memory having a capacity of 8 GB. Where a user has subscriptions to many magazines journal etc. which may include detailed photographs e.g. Vogue Vanity Fair etc. the flash memory of a tablet device may become filled upon download of a few months of magazine issues. As an example a user may have to delete downloaded content to load additional content. As another example a user may download portions of content via a network where the portions are downloaded in chunks to memory. As illustrated by one or more of the foregoing examples various manners exist for download and rendering of content for a tablet device.

As shown in the method includes an access block for accessing content a render block for rendering a portion of the content a receive block for receiving a scroll command and a render block for rendering a bound graphic for example responsive to receipt of a scroll command that calls for rendering content adjacent to a bound of the content.

As an example a method can include accessing content stored in a data store where the content includes a bound and content adjacent to the bound rendering a portion of the content to a display receiving a scroll command that calls for rendering the content adjacent to the bound and responsive to receipt of the scroll command rendering a bound graphic. In such an example the bound graphic may be a colored bar e.g. a vertical colored bar or a horizontal colored bar . As an example a method can include accessing content stored in a data store via a network.

As an example a method can include responsive to receipt of a scroll command rendering content adjacent to a bound bidirectionally with respect to time e.g. for a snap visual effect . As an example a method can include responsive to receipt of a scroll command issuing a control signal that initiates movement of a display e.g. a device that includes a display . In such an example the movement may notify the user that a bound of content has been reached responsive to receipt of a scroll command e.g. to advance or reverse with respect to content .

As an example content may be that of a webpage an e book subscription content accessible via verification of a credential etc.

As an example a bound graphic may be a graphical user interface GUI . In such an example a method may include receiving a command via the graphical user interface to access additional content stored in a data store where the additional content includes a bound e.g. of previously accessed content and an additional bound and content adjacent to the additional bound.

As an example where a bound graphic is rendered to a display circuitry may provide for input of a command via voice motion of the display etc. For example a method may include receiving a motion signal responsive to motion of a display and responsive to receipt of the motion signal accessing additional content e.g. for rendering to the display per a prior received scroll command .

As an example a device can include a touch display memory a processor operably coupled to the touch display and the memory and instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor to receive content store the received content in ordered pages of the memory render a portion of the stored content from the ordered pages of the memory to the touch display receive a command that calls for rendering stored content from a last page of the ordered pages of the memory and responsive to receipt of the command rendering the stored content from the last page to the display with a graphic that indicates content from the last page has been rendered to the display. In such an example the command may be a command received via the touch display. As an example a graphic may be a bar. As an example a device may include haptic input circuitry where a command may be received via the haptic input circuitry.

As an example one or more computer readable storage media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to initiate a grid for structuring bounded content renderable to a display where the grid includes a first bound array for association with a first bound of the bounded content a content array and a second bound array for association with a second bound of the bounded content and initiate a scroll control for scrolling structured bounded content with respect to the content array of the grid for rendering the first bound array of the grid in association with the first bound of the bounded content and for rendering the second bound array of the grid in association with the second bound of the bounded content. In such an example the first bound array may be a red bar the second bound array may be a red bar or the first bound array and the second bound array may each be a red bar. As an example instruction may be provided to initiate a grid with a first bound array and a second bound array horizontally or vertically.

As shown in the example of the invocation block may invoke one or more bound commands such as a warning graphic command a utility graphic command a visual snap command a haptic command a fetch command and or a message command . As mentioned where a bound command calls for rendering a graphic to a display a method may optionally include accessing a color scheme associated with an application for example to harmonize an overall look for the application together with the graphic.

As shown in the example of the invocation block may invoke one or more bound commands such as a warning graphic command and or a fetch command for fetching additional content from the data store . As an example the data store may be a subscription data store accessible by a credential. In such an example a bound command may be invoked that uses the credential for example if a network session with the data store has expired. For example consider a command calling for issuance of a bound graphic such as a red bar. In response a device may automatically or responsive to receipt of user input attempt to access additional content from a secure data store e.g. requiring authentication via a password a pin a credential etc. . As mentioned a user input might be a shake that shakes the display such that an accelerometer gyroscope or other sensor of the display e.g. tablet device with a display senses the shake and transmits a sensed signal or instruction to circuitry of the device to call for accessing additional content. As to an e book the additional content may be one or more additional pages of content for example pages of another chapter of a book etc.

As shown in the example of the invocation block may invoke one or more bound commands such as a utility graphic command and or a haptic command for issuing a signal to a haptic device for example which may vibrate shift etc. the display e.g. a handheld tablet device with the display to notify a user that a time bound has been reached. As an example a time bound property may be a reading time an appointment time etc. Thus in such a manner a user may complete consumption e.g. reading viewing etc. of content currently being display without interruption. In such an example when the user attempts to consume additional content the time bound may invoke one or more commands. Such an example can be beneficial to a user s experience as well as network access congestion etc. as if a user has an appointment the device may avoid performing one or more actions that may be unrelated to the user s next course of action. For example invocation of a time bound may notify a user and cause the device to enter a sleep or shut down state e.g. within a few moments after issuance of the notification for example to allow a user to change his or her mind .

As shown in the example of the invocation block may invoke one or more bound commands such as a utility graphic command and or a message command . As an example content received via the network may be subject to an agreement with one or more advertisers. As an example the content may be portioned such that every X pages every article every chapter etc. is interspersed with one or more advertisements. In the example of the utility graphic command may call for rendering an advertisement or may perform rendering of an advertisement optionally with one or more utility graphic controls that may allow a user to input one or more actions associated with the advertisement e.g. purchase product or service being advertised access information associated with the advertisement such as a website etc. . In the example of the message command may call for display of an advertiser message for example for a period of time or until a user provides input for a command to close the advertiser message return to content consumption etc.

In the example of user experience may be enhanced as an advertisement may occur responsive to a scroll command which calls for additional content. In such a manner an advertisement may be rendered to a display with some assurance that a user has completed viewing reading etc. currently displayed content. Thus the overall impact may be a short interruption to display an advertisement prior to display of additional content e.g. as associated with the user s intention by activating the scroll control .

In the example the bound graphics and can provide a user with visual indication of bounds of an application interface that provides content e.g. including the content and . In such an example a user can scroll or swipe to see if the application has more content to be displayed. The bound graphics and can serve as bookends e.g. whether stretched or unstretched to give visual notification to the user of the beginning end and or sides of the content within an application. The bookends may be colored to show a distinct visual edge to the user. If the user attempts to swipe or scroll past a bookend as an example the bookend may snap back into place to give visual feedback to the user that the edge has been reached. For example a stretched state may be temporary and achieved by a progressive widening of the bookend followed by a progressive thinning of the bookend e.g. to a default or unstretched state .

As an example bound graphics such as bookends may be used on top bottom left and or right side of an application. As an example bookends may be square rectangular circular polygonal or other shapes to enclose an application e.g. content bounds of content associated with the application .

As an example a bound graphic e.g. a bookend may be clickable by a user to load additional content for example if available e.g. and or accessible . As an example if a bookend is clickable it may show an icon overlay alternate color to indicate that it can be expanded e.g. drop down menu or other display technique . As an example where selected an application may call for accessing loading etc. of additional content for example adjacent to the existing content. In such an example a bound graphic e.g. a bookend or other type of graphic may be configured to move to a new location for the newly loaded content. As an example a bound graphic may automatically expand as content is loaded.

As an example haptic feedback may be used to signal to a user that a bound e.g. an end is reached when attempting to scroll past a bound graphic such as a bookend. As an example a bound graphic may be rendered to a display as a solid bar see e.g. the bound graphics and of or for example it may show a line when the end is reached. Beyond a bookend a graphic text different color advertisement etc. may be displayed as the bookend is pulled by the user. As an example a bound graphic may be a bar e.g. a red bar etc. that stretches to indicate to a user that a bound e.g. an end of content has been reached.

The term circuit or circuitry is used in the summary description and or claims. As is well known in the art the term circuitry includes all levels of available integration e.g. from discrete logic circuits to the highest level of circuit integration such as VLSI and includes programmable logic components programmed to perform the functions of an embodiment as well as general purpose or special purpose processors programmed with instructions to perform those functions. Such circuitry may optionally rely on one or more computer readable media that includes computer executable instructions. As described herein a computer readable medium may be a storage device e.g. a memory card a storage disk etc. and referred to as a computer readable storage medium.

While various examples of circuits or circuitry have been discussed depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system . The system may be a desktop computer system such as one of the ThinkCentre or ThinkPad series of personal computers sold by Lenovo US Inc. of Morrisville N.C. or a workstation computer such as the ThinkStation which are sold by Lenovo US Inc. of Morrisville N.C. however as apparent from the description herein a satellite a base a server or other machine may include other features or only some of the features of the system . As an example a device such as one of the devices of may include at least some of the features of the system .

As shown in the system includes a so called chipset . A chipset refers to a group of integrated circuits or chips that are designed e.g. configured to work together. Chipsets are usually marketed as a single product e.g. consider chipsets marketed under the brands INTEL AMD etc. .

In the example of the chipset has a particular architecture which may vary to some extent depending on brand or manufacturer. The architecture of the chipset includes a core and memory control group and an I O controller hub that exchange information e.g. data signals commands etc. via for example a direct management interface or direct media interface DMI or a link controller . In the example of the DMI is a chip to chip interface sometimes referred to as being a link between a northbridge and a southbridge .

The core and memory control group include one or more processors e.g. single core or multi core and a memory controller hub that exchange information via a front side bus FSB . As described herein various components of the core and memory control group may be integrated onto a single processor die for example to make a chip that supplants the conventional northbridge style architecture.

The memory controller hub interfaces with memory . For example the memory controller hub may provide support for DDR SDRAM memory e.g. DDR DDR DDR etc. . In general the memory is a type of random access memory RAM . It is often referred to as system memory .

The memory controller hub further includes a low voltage differential signaling interface LVDS . The LVDS may be a so called LVDS Display Interface LDI for support of a display device e.g. a CRT a flat panel a projector etc. . A block includes some examples of technologies that may be supported via the LVDS interface e.g. serial digital video HDMI DVI display port . The memory controller hub also includes one or more PCI express interfaces PCI E for example for support of discrete graphics . Discrete graphics using a PCI E interface has become an alternative approach to an accelerated graphics port AGP . For example the memory controller hub may include a 16 lane x16 PCI E port for an external PCI E based graphics card. A system may include AGP or PCI E for support of graphics. As described herein a display may be a sensor display e.g. configured for receipt of input using a stylus a finger etc. . As described herein a sensor display may rely on resistive sensing optical sensing or other type of sensing.

The I O hub controller includes a variety of interfaces. The example of includes a SATA interface one or more PCI E interfaces optionally one or more legacy PCI interfaces one or more USB interfaces a LAN interface more generally a network interface a general purpose I O interface GPIO a low pin count LPC interface a power management interface a clock generator interface an audio interface e.g. for speakers a total cost of operation TCO interface a system management bus interface e.g. a multi master serial computer bus interface and a serial peripheral flash memory controller interface SPI Flash which in the example of includes BIOS and boot code . With respect to network connections the I O hub controller may include integrated gigabit Ethernet controller lines multiplexed with a PCI E interface port. Other network features may operate independent of a PCI E interface.

The interfaces of the I O hub controller provide for communication with various devices networks etc. For example the SATA interface provides for reading writing or reading and writing information on one or more drives such as HDDs SDDs or a combination thereof. The I O hub controller may also include an advanced host controller interface AHCI to support one or more drives . The PCI E interface allows for wireless connections to devices networks etc. The USB interface provides for input devices such as keyboards KB one or more optical sensors mice and various other devices e.g. microphones cameras phones storage media players etc. . On or more other types of sensors may optionally rely on the USB interface or another interface e.g. IC etc. . As to microphones the system of may include hardware e.g. audio card appropriately configured for receipt of sound e.g. user voice ambient sound etc. .

In the example of the LPC interface provides for use of one or more ASICs a trusted platform module TPM a super I O a firmware hub BIOS support as well as various types of memory such as ROM Flash and non volatile RAM NVRAM . With respect to the TPM this module may be in the form of a chip that can be used to authenticate software and hardware devices. For example a TPM may be capable of performing platform authentication and may be used to verify that a system seeking access is the expected system.

The system upon power on may be configured to execute boot code for the BIOS as stored within the SPI Flash and thereafter processes data under the control of one or more operating systems and application software e.g. stored in system memory . An operating system may be stored in any of a variety of locations and accessed for example according to instructions of the BIOS . Again as described herein a satellite a base a server or other machine may include fewer or more features than shown in the system of . Further the system of is shown as optionally include cell phone circuitry which may include GSM CDMA etc. types of circuitry configured for coordinated operation with one or more of the other features of the system . Also shown in is battery circuitry which may provide one or more battery power etc. associated features e.g. optionally to instruct one or more other components of the system as well as mass shift circuitry e.g. to receive one or more signals to shift a mass to latch a mass etc. such as a battery mass or a batteries mass . As mentioned a SMBus may be operable via a LPC see e.g. the LPC interface via an IC interface see e.g. the SM IC interface etc.

Although examples of methods devices systems etc. have been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological acts it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather the specific features and acts are disclosed as examples of forms of implementing the claimed methods devices systems etc.
