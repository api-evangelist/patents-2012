The present U.S. Utility patent application is claiming priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 448 526 entitled Dispersed Storage Network Directory System Utilization filed Mar. 2 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes.

This invention relates generally to computing systems and more particularly to data storage solutions within such computing systems.

Computers are known to communicate process and store data. Such computers range from wireless smart phones to data centers that support millions of web searches stock trades or on line purchases every day. In general a computing system generates data and or manipulates data from one form into another. For instance an image sensor of the computing system generates raw picture data and using an image compression program e.g. JPEG MPEG etc. the computing system manipulates the raw picture data into a standardized compressed image.

With continued advances in processing speed and communication speed computers are capable of processing real time multimedia data for applications ranging from simple voice communications to streaming high definition video. As such general purpose information appliances are replacing purpose built communications devices e.g. a telephone . For example smart phones can support telephony communications but they are also capable of text messaging and accessing the internet to perform functions including email web browsing remote applications access and media communications e.g. telephony voice image transfer music files video files real time video streaming. etc. .

Each type of computer is constructed and operates in accordance with one or more communication processing and storage standards. As a result of standardization and with advances in technology more and more information content is being converted into digital formats. For example more digital cameras are now being sold than film cameras thus producing more digital pictures. As another example web based programming is becoming an alternative to over the air television broadcasts and or cable broadcasts. As further examples papers books video entertainment home video etc. are now being stored digitally which increases the demand on the storage function of computers.

A typical computer storage system includes one or more memory devices aligned with the needs of the various operational aspects of the computer s processing and communication functions. Generally the immediacy of access dictates what type of memory device is used. For example random access memory RAM memory can be accessed in any random order with a constant response time thus it is typically used for cache memory and main memory. By contrast memory device technologies that require physical movement such as magnetic disks tapes and optical discs have a variable response time as the physical movement can take longer than the data transfer thus they are typically used for secondary memory e.g. hard drive backup memory etc. .

A computer s storage system will be compliant with one or more computer storage standards that include but are not limited to network file system NFS flash file system FFS disk file system DFS small computer system interface SCSI internet small computer system interface iSCSI file transfer protocol FTP and web based distributed authoring and versioning WebDAV . These standards specify the data storage format e.g. files data objects data blocks directories etc. and interfacing between the computer s processing function and its storage system which is a primary function of the computer s memory controller.

Despite the standardization of the computer and its storage system memory devices fail especially commercial grade memory devices that utilize technologies incorporating physical movement e.g. a disc drive . For example it is fairly common for a disc drive to routinely suffer from bit level corruption and to completely fail after three years of use. One solution is to utilize a higher grade disc drive which adds significant cost to a computer.

Another solution is to utilize multiple levels of redundant disc drives to replicate the data into two or more copies. One such redundant drive approach is called redundant array of independent discs RAID . In a RAID device a RAID controller adds parity data to the original data before storing it across the array. The parity data is calculated from the original data such that the failure of a disc will not result in the loss of the original data. For example RAID 5 uses three discs to protect data from the failure of a single disc. The parity data and associated redundancy overhead data reduces the storage capacity of three independent discs by one third e.g. n 1 capacity . RAID 6 can recover from a loss of two discs and requires a minimum of four discs with a storage capacity of n 2.

While RAID addresses the memory device failure issue it is not without its own failure issues that affect its effectiveness efficiency and security. For instance as more discs are added to the array the probability of a disc failure increases which increases the demand for maintenance. For example when a disc fails it needs to be manually replaced before another disc fails and the data stored in the RAID device is lost. To reduce the risk of data loss data on a RAID device is typically copied on to one or more other RAID devices. While this addresses the loss of data issue it raises a security issue since multiple copies of data are available which increases the chances of unauthorized access. Further as the amount of data being stored grows the overhead of RAID devices becomes a non trivial efficiency issue.

The DSN memory includes a plurality of distributed storage DS units for storing data of the system. Each of the DS units includes a processing module and memory and may be located at a geographically different site than the other DS units e.g. one in Chicago one in Milwaukee etc. .

Each of the user devices the DS processing unit the DS managing unit and the storage integrity processing unit may be a portable computing device e.g. a social networking device a gaming device a cell phone a smart phone a personal digital assistant a digital music player a digital video player a laptop computer a handheld computer a video game controller and or any other portable device that includes a computing core and or a fixed computing device e.g. a personal computer a computer server a cable set top box a satellite receiver a television set a printer a fax machine home entertainment equipment a video game console and or any type of home or office computing equipment . Such a portable or fixed computing device includes a computing core and one or more interfaces and or . An embodiment of the computing core will be described with reference to .

With respect to the interfaces each of the interfaces and includes software and or hardware to support one or more communication links via the network indirectly and or directly. For example interfaces support a communication link wired wireless direct via a LAN via the network etc. between the first type of user device and the DS processing unit . As another example DSN interface supports a plurality of communication links via the network between the DSN memory and the DS processing unit the first type of user device and or the storage integrity processing unit . As yet another example interface supports a communication link between the DS managing unit and any one of the other devices and or units and or via the network .

In general and with respect to data storage the system supports three primary functions distributed network data storage management distributed data storage and retrieval and data storage integrity verification. In accordance with these three primary functions data can be distributedly stored in a plurality of physically different locations and subsequently retrieved in a reliable and secure manner regardless of failures of individual storage devices failures of network equipment the duration of storage the amount of data being stored attempts at hacking the data etc.

The DS managing unit performs distributed network data storage management functions which include establishing distributed data storage parameters performing network operations performing network administration and or performing network maintenance. The DS managing unit establishes the distributed data storage parameters e.g. allocation of virtual DSN memory space distributed storage parameters security parameters billing information user profile information etc. for one or more of the user devices e.g. established for individual devices established for a user group of devices established for public access by the user devices etc. . For example the DS managing unit coordinates the creation of a vault e.g. a virtual memory block within the DSN memory for a user device for a group of devices or for public access . The DS managing unit also determines the distributed data storage parameters for the vault. In particular the DS managing unit determines a number of slices e.g. the number that a data segment of a data file and or data block is partitioned into for distributed storage and a read threshold value e.g. the minimum number of slices required to reconstruct the data segment .

As another example the DS managing module creates and stores locally or within the DSN memory user profile information. The user profile information includes one or more of authentication information permissions and or the security parameters. The security parameters may include one or more of encryption decryption scheme one or more encryption keys key generation scheme and data encoding decoding scheme.

As yet another example the DS managing unit creates billing information for a particular user user group vault access public vault access etc. For instance the DS managing unit tracks the number of times a user accesses a private vault and or public vaults which can be used to generate a per access bill. In another instance the DS managing unit tracks the amount of data stored and or retrieved by a user device and or a user group which can be used to generate a per data amount bill.

The DS managing unit also performs network operations network administration and or network maintenance. As at least part of performing the network operations and or administration the DS managing unit monitors performance of the devices and or units of the system for potential failures determines the devices and or units activation status determines the devices and or units loading and any other system level operation that affects the performance level of the system . For example the DS managing unit receives and aggregates network management alarms alerts errors status information performance information and messages from the devices and or the units . For example the DS managing unit receives a simple network management protocol SNMP message regarding the status of the DS processing unit .

The DS managing unit performs the network maintenance by identifying equipment within the system that needs replacing upgrading repairing and or expanding. For example the DS managing unit determines that the DSN memory needs more DS units or that one or more of the DS units needs updating.

The second primary function i.e. distributed data storage and retrieval begins and ends with a user device . For instance if a second type of user device has a data file and or data block to store in the DSN memory it sends the data file and or data block to the DS processing unit via its interface . As will be described in greater detail with reference to the interface functions to mimic a conventional operating system OS file system interface e.g. network file system NFS flash file system FFS disk file system DFS file transfer protocol FTP web based distributed authoring and versioning WebDAV etc. and or a block memory interface e.g. small computer system interface SCSI internet small computer system interface iSCSI etc. . In addition the interface may attach a user identification code ID to the data file and or data block .

The DS processing unit receives the data file and or data block via its interface and performs a distributed storage DS process thereon e.g. an error coding dispersal storage function . The DS processing begins by partitioning the data file and or data block into one or more data segments which is represented as Y data segments. For example the DS processing may partition the data file and or data block into a fixed byte size segment e.g. 2to 2bytes where n 2 or a variable byte size e.g. change byte size from segment to segment or from groups of segments to groups of segments etc. .

For each of the Y data segments the DS processing error encodes e.g. forward error correction FEC information dispersal algorithm or error correction coding and slices or slices then error encodes the data segment into a plurality of error coded EC data slices which is represented as X slices per data segment. The number of slices X per segment which corresponds to a number of pillars n is set in accordance with the distributed data storage parameters and the error coding scheme.

For example if a Reed Solomon or other FEC scheme is used in an n k system then a data segment is divided into n slices where k number of slices is needed to reconstruct the original data i.e. k is the threshold . As a few specific examples the n k factor may be 5 3 6 4 8 6 8 5 16 10.

For each EC slice the DS processing unit creates a unique slice name and appends it to the corresponding EC slice . The slice name includes universal DSN memory addressing routing information e.g. virtual memory addresses in the DSN memory and user specific information e.g. user ID file name data block identifier etc. .

The DS processing unit transmits the plurality of EC slices to a plurality of DS units of the DSN memory via the DSN interface and the network . The DSN interface formats each of the slices for transmission via the network . For example the DSN interface may utilize an internet protocol e.g. TCP IP etc. to packetize the EC slices for transmission via the network .

The number of DS units receiving the EC slices is dependent on the distributed data storage parameters established by the DS managing unit . For example the DS managing unit may indicate that each slice is to be stored in a different DS unit . As another example the DS managing unit may indicate that like slice numbers of different data segments are to be stored in the same DS unit . For example the first slice of each of the data segments is to be stored in a first DS unit the second slice of each of the data segments is to be stored in a second DS unit etc. In this manner the data is encoded and distributedly stored at physically diverse locations to improve data storage integrity and security.

Each DS unit that receives an EC slice for storage translates the virtual DSN memory address of the slice into a local physical address for storage. Accordingly each DS unit maintains a virtual to physical memory mapping to assist in the storage and retrieval of data.

The first type of user device performs a similar function to store data in the DSN memory with the exception that it includes the DS processing. As such the device encodes and slices the data file and or data block it has to store. The device then transmits the slices to the DSN memory via its DSN interface and the network .

For a second type of user device to retrieve a data file or data block from memory it issues a read command via its interface to the DS processing unit . The DS processing unit performs the DS processing to identify the DS units storing the slices of the data file and or data block based on the read command. The DS processing unit may also communicate with the DS managing unit to verify that the user device is authorized to access the requested data.

Assuming that the user device is authorized to access the requested data the DS processing unit issues slice read commands to at least a threshold number of the DS units storing the requested data e.g. to at least 10 DS units for a 16 10 error coding scheme . Each of the DS units receiving the slice read command verifies the command accesses its virtual to physical memory mapping retrieves the requested slice or slices and transmits it to the DS processing unit .

Once the DS processing unit has received a read threshold number of slices for a data segment it performs an error decoding function and de slicing to reconstruct the data segment. When Y number of data segments has been reconstructed the DS processing unit provides the data file and or data block to the user device . Note that the first type of user device performs a similar process to retrieve a data file and or data block.

The storage integrity processing unit performs the third primary function of data storage integrity verification. In general the storage integrity processing unit periodically retrieves slices and or slice names of a data file or data block of a user device to verify that one or more slices have not been corrupted or lost e.g. the DS unit failed . The retrieval process mimics the read process previously described.

If the storage integrity processing unit determines that one or more slices is corrupted or lost it rebuilds the corrupted or lost slice s in accordance with the error coding scheme. The storage integrity processing unit stores the rebuild slice or slices in the appropriate DS unit s in a manner that mimics the write process previously described.

In an example of storing data the gateway module receives an incoming data object that includes a user ID field an object name field and the data object field and may also receive corresponding information that includes a process identifier e.g. an internal process application ID metadata a file system directory a block number a transaction message a user device identity ID a data object identifier a source name and or user information. The gateway module authenticates the user associated with the data object by verifying the user ID with the DS managing unit and or another authenticating unit.

When the user is authenticated the gateway module obtains user information from the management unit the user device and or the other authenticating unit. The user information includes a vault identifier operational parameters and user attributes e.g. user data billing information etc. . A vault identifier identifies a vault which is a virtual memory space that maps to a set of DS storage units . For example vault i.e. user s DSN memory space includes eight DS storage units X 8 wide and vault i.e. user s DSN memory space includes sixteen DS storage units X 16 wide . The operational parameters may include an error coding algorithm the width n number of pillars X or slices per segment for this vault a read threshold T a write threshold an encryption algorithm a slicing parameter a compression algorithm an integrity check method caching settings parallelism settings and or other parameters that may be used to access the DSN memory layer.

The gateway module uses the user information to assign a source name to the data. For instance the gateway module determines the source name of the data object based on the vault identifier and the data object. For example the source name may contain a file identifier ID a vault generation number a reserved field and a vault identifier ID . As another example the gateway module may generate the file ID based on a hash function of the data object . Note that the gateway module may also perform message conversion protocol conversion electrical conversion optical conversion access control user identification user information retrieval traffic monitoring statistics generation configuration management and or source name determination.

The access module receives the data object and creates a series of data segments through Y in accordance with a data storage protocol e.g. file storage system a block storage system and or an aggregated block storage system . The number of segments Y may be chosen or randomly assigned based on a selected segment size and the size of the data object. For example if the number of segments is chosen to be a fixed number then the size of the segments varies as a function of the size of the data object. For instance if the data object is an image file of 4 194 304 eight bit bytes e.g. 33 554 432 bits and the number of segments Y 131 072 then each segment is 256 bits or 32 bytes. As another example if segment size is fixed then the number of segments Y varies based on the size of data object. For instance if the data object is an image file of 4 194 304 bytes and the fixed size of each segment is 4 096 bytes then the number of segments Y 1 024. Note that each segment is associated with the same source name.

The grid module receives the data segments and may manipulate e.g. compression encryption cyclic redundancy check CRC etc. each of the data segments before performing an error coding function of the error coding dispersal storage function to produce a pre manipulated data segment. After manipulating a data segment if applicable the grid module error encodes e.g. Reed Solomon Convolution encoding Trellis encoding etc. the data segment or manipulated data segment into X error coded data slices .

The value X or the number of pillars e.g. X 16 is chosen as a parameter of the error coding dispersal storage function. Other parameters of the error coding dispersal function include a read threshold T a write threshold W etc. The read threshold e.g. T 10 when X 16 corresponds to the minimum number of error free error coded data slices required to reconstruct the data segment. In other words the DS processing module can compensate for X T e.g. 16 10 6 missing error coded data slices per data segment. The write threshold W corresponds to a minimum number of DS storage units that acknowledge proper storage of their respective data slices before the DS processing module indicates proper storage of the encoded data segment. Note that the write threshold is greater than or equal to the read threshold for a given number of pillars X .

For each data slice of a data segment the grid module generates a unique slice name and attaches it thereto. The slice name includes a universal routing information field and a vault specific field and may be 48 bytes e.g. 24 bytes for each of the universal routing information field and the vault specific field . As illustrated the universal routing information field includes a slice index a vault ID a vault generation and a reserved field. The slice index is based on the pillar number and the vault ID and as such is unique for each pillar e.g. slices of the same pillar for the same vault for any segment will share the same slice index . The vault specific field includes a data name which includes a file ID and a segment number e.g. a sequential numbering of data segments Y of a simple data object or a data block number .

Prior to outputting the error coded data slices of a data segment the grid module may perform post slice manipulation on the slices. If enabled the manipulation includes slice level compression encryption CRC addressing tagging and or other manipulation to improve the effectiveness of the computing system.

When the error coded data slices of a data segment are ready to be outputted the grid module determines which of the DS storage units will store the EC data slices based on a dispersed storage memory mapping associated with the user s vault and or DS storage unit attributes. The DS storage unit attributes may include availability self selection performance history link speed link latency ownership available DSN memory domain cost a prioritization scheme a centralized selection message from another source a lookup table data ownership and or any other factor to optimize the operation of the computing system. Note that the number of DS storage units is equal to or greater than the number of pillars e.g. X so that no more than one error coded data slice of the same data segment is stored on the same DS storage unit . Further note that EC data slices of the same pillar number but of different segments e.g. EC data slice of data segment and EC data slice of data segment may be stored on the same or different DS storage units .

The storage module performs an integrity check on the outbound encoded data slices and when successful identifies a plurality of DS storage units based on information provided by the grid module . The storage module then outputs the encoded data slices through X of each segment through Y to the DS storage units . Each of the DS storage units stores its EC data slice s and maintains a local virtual DSN address to physical location table to convert the virtual DSN address of the EC data slice s into physical storage addresses.

In an example of a read operation the user device and or sends a read request to the DS processing unit which authenticates the request. When the request is authentic the DS processing unit sends a read message to each of the DS storage units storing slices of the data object being read. The slices are received via the DSnet interface and processed by the storage module which performs a parity check and provides the slices to the grid module when the parity check was successful. The grid module decodes the slices in accordance with the error coding dispersal storage function to reconstruct the data segment. The access module reconstructs the data object from the data segments and the gateway module formats the data object for transmission to the user device.

In an example of write operation the pre slice manipulator receives a data segment and a write instruction from an authorized user device. The pre slice manipulator determines if pre manipulation of the data segment is required and if so what type. The pre slice manipulator may make the determination independently or based on instructions from the control unit where the determination is based on a computing system wide predetermination a table lookup vault parameters associated with the user identification the type of data security requirements available DSN memory performance requirements and or other metadata.

Once a positive determination is made the pre slice manipulator manipulates the data segment in accordance with the type of manipulation. For example the type of manipulation may be compression e.g. Lempel Ziv Welch Huffman Golomb fractal wavelet etc. signatures e.g. Digital Signature Algorithm DSA Elliptic Curve DSA Secure Hash Algorithm etc. watermarking tagging encryption e.g. Data Encryption Standard Advanced Encryption Standard etc. adding metadata e.g. time date stamping user information file type etc. cyclic redundancy check e.g. CRC32 and or other data manipulations to produce the pre manipulated data segment.

The encoder encodes the pre manipulated data segment using a forward error correction FEC encoder and or other type of erasure coding and or error coding to produce an encoded data segment . The encoder determines which forward error correction algorithm to use based on a predetermination associated with the user s vault a time based algorithm user direction DS managing unit direction control unit direction as a function of the data type as a function of the data segment metadata and or any other factor to determine algorithm type. The forward error correction algorithm may be Golay Multidimensional parity Reed Solomon Hamming Bose Ray Chauduri Hocquenghem BCH Cauchy Reed Solomon or any other FEC encoder. Note that the encoder may use a different encoding algorithm for each data segment the same encoding algorithm for the data segments of a data object or a combination thereof.

The encoded data segment is of greater size than the data segment by the overhead rate of the encoding algorithm by a factor of X T where X is the width or number of slices and T is the read threshold. In this regard the corresponding decoding process can accommodate at most X T missing EC data slices and still recreate the data segment . For example if X 16 and T 10 then the data segment will be recoverable as long as 10 or more EC data slices per segment are not corrupted.

The slicer transforms the encoded data segment into EC data slices in accordance with the slicing parameter from the vault for this user and or data segment . For example if the slicing parameter is X 16 then the slicer slices each encoded data segment into 16 encoded slices.

The post slice manipulator performs if enabled post manipulation on the encoded slices to produce the EC data slices. If enabled the post slice manipulator determines the type of post manipulation which may be based on a computing system wide predetermination parameters in the vault for this user a table lookup the user identification the type of data security requirements available DSN memory performance requirements control unit directed and or other metadata. Note that the type of post slice manipulation may include slice level compression signatures encryption CRC addressing watermarking tagging adding metadata and or other manipulation to improve the effectiveness of the computing system.

In an example of a read operation the post slice de manipulator receives at least a read threshold number of EC data slices and performs the inverse function of the post slice manipulator to produce a plurality of encoded slices. The de slicer de slices the encoded slices to produce an encoded data segment . The decoder performs the inverse function of the encoder to recapture the data segment . The pre slice de manipulator performs the inverse function of the pre slice manipulator to recapture the data segment .

The messages include a request messages and response messages wherein the response messages are formed in response to a corresponding request message of request messages . A requester generates and sends a request message to a responder. The responder generates and sends the response message to the requester. For example the requester generates and sends a read request message to solicit a retrieval action and the responder generates and sends a corresponding read response message to provide information associated with the read request message . As another example the DS processing of the user device e.g. the requester generates a request and outputs the request to the DSN interface of the user device . The DSN interface of the user device transforms the request to produce and send the request message to the DS unit e.g. the responder . The computing core of the DS unit generates a response and outputs the response to the DSN interface of the DS unit . The DSN interface of the DS unit transforms the response to produce and send the response message to the user device .

Requester and responder roles may change when a request response message pair is initiated by another unit of the system. For example DS unit e.g. the requester generates and sends the request message to the user device e.g. the responder . The user device generates and sends the response message to the DS unit in response to receiving the request message . Such request response message pairs may be utilized by any module or unit of the system. The request messages may be sent by one requester to one or more responders such that the same request message is sent to two or more responders when a plurality of responders is selected. Such a selection of a plurality of responders is discussed in greater detail with reference to .

The protocol header includes one or more of a protocol class field a protocol class version field an operation code field a request response field a request number field and a payload length field . Such a protocol class field contains any number of bytes to specify a sub protocol identifier to enable a plurality of families of protocols to be utilized. For example the protocol class field is one byte in length and includes a protocol class value of 01 hex to signify a first protocol class. The protocol class version field contains any number of bytes to specify a sub protocol version associated with the protocol class enabling a plurality of versions of protocols to be utilized with each protocol class. For example the protocol class version field is one byte in length and includes a protocol class version value of 01 hex to signify a first protocol class version.

The operation code field contains any number of bytes to specify an operation code associated with a requested action providing message interpretation instructions to a message target. For example the operation code field is one byte in length and includes an operation code value of a read operation. The request response field contains any number of bytes to specify whether the message is a request message or a response message. For example the request response field is one byte in length and a response reserve value is indicated by a one bit flag of the byte e.g. a most significant bit of the byte . In an instance a flag value of the one bit flag is zero when the message is a request message. In another instance the flag value of the one bit flag is one when the message is a response message.

The request number field contains any number of bytes to include a request number value to associate at least one request message with at least one response message. Such a request number value may be produced as at least one of a random number a random number plus a predetermined number and based on a previous request number. For example the request number field is four bytes in length and includes a request number value of 457 to associate a read request message with a read response message when the previous request number value is 456. As another example the request number field includes a request number value of 5 358 to associate a read response message with a read request message when a request number value of 5 358 is extracted from the read request message.

The payload length field contains any number of bytes to include a payload length value to indicate a number of bytes contained in the payload . Such a payload length value may be determined based on one or more of counting bytes of the payload utilizing a predetermined number based on one or more of the protocol class value the protocol class version value the operation code value and the response reserved value and utilizing a predetermined formula based on one or more of the protocol class value the protocol class version value the operation code value and the response reserved value. For example the payload length field is four bytes in length and includes a payload length value of zero when the operation code value is associated with a write rollback response operation and the response reserved value is associated with a response message. As another example the payload length field includes a payload length value of 104 when the operation code value is associated with a read request message and a predetermined formula of 48n 8 associated with the read request message is utilized e.g. where n 2 corresponding to 2 slice names .

The payload may be organized into one or more payload fields in accordance with one or more of the values of the protocol class field protocol class version field the operation code field and the request response field . The one or more payload fields include payload bytes M wherein values of the payload bytes M are establishing accordance with the one or more payload fields. For example the one or more payload fields include slice name fields when the payload is associated with a read request DSN frame. As another example the one or more payload fields include one or more encoded data slices when the payload is associated with a read response DSN frame. The method to generate the fields of the DSN frame and to generate values for the fields is discussed in greater detail with reference to .

In an example of operation the DS processing dispersed storage error encodes data utilizing the dispersed storage error coding parameters to produce 3 sets of encoded data slices   through   e.g. set one includes slices through   . The DS processing outputs a write request that includes the three sets of encoded data slices to the DSN interface . The DSN interface generates at least one write request DSN frame wherein at least one payload section of the at least one write request DSN frame includes at least one encoded data slice of the three sets of encoded data slices. The DSN interface sends the at least one write request DSN frame to the DS units wherein the at least one write request DSN frame sent to DS unit includes payload the at least one write request DSN frame sent to DS unit includes payload the at least one write request DSN frame sent to DS unit includes payload and the at least one write request DSN frame sent to DS unit includes payload .

The DSN interface selects at least one encoded data slice of the three sets of encoded data slices to include in each of the payloads . The DSN interface may select at least one of all slices of a corresponding pillar of the three sets of encoded data slices per payload e.g. pillar one slices are included in the payload one slice of the corresponding pillar of the three sets of encoded data slices per payload e.g. one slice of pillar is included in payload all encoded data slices of the three sets of encoded data slices for all payloads and one set e.g. from one data segment of encoded data slices of the three sets of encoded data slices for all payloads .

The payload scenarios A D represent example scenarios indicating which encoded data slices of the three sets of encoded data slices are included in the payloads . Payload scenario A represents a scenario where the DSN interface selects all slices of the corresponding pillar of the three sets of encoded data slices per payload. For example the DSN interface selects slices     and   of pillar to be included in payload slices     and   of pillar to be included in payload slices     and   of pillar to be included in payload and slices     and   of pillar to be included in payload . Payload scenario B represents a scenario where the DSN interface selects one slice of the corresponding pillar of the three sets of encoded data slices per payload.

The DS processing unit shares the directory information with at least one other DS processing units of the one or more DS processing units . For example a first DS processing unit generates the directory information to include an open completed status update indicator that indicates an open status and sends the directory information via the network and or the LAN to a second DS processing unit when the first DS processing unit initiates a sequence to generate and store encoded data slices . The second DS processing unit receives the directory information and determines that the open completed status update indicator indicates the open status.

The method continues at step where the processing module determines directory entry reassignments. The determination may be based on one or more of a number of entries the directory metrics the number of layers the spans per layer one or more file IDs an estimated frequency of access associated with a file ID and a data type indicator. For example the processing module determines to reassign file ID to a top layer directory file to reduce access latency based on a data type indicator e.g. a priority indicator associated with the file ID. As another example the processing module determines to reassign file ID to a lower layer directory file where increased access latency is acceptable when an estimated frequency of access associated with file ID is lower.

The method continues at step where the processing module reconfigures the directory structure in accordance with the number of layers the spans per layer and the directory entry reassignments to produce the reconfigured directory structure.

The updated local DSN directory file includes one or more directory file entries that populate each of the pathname field the source name field and the extended data field . For example a second DS processing unit modifies or adds an entry to the local DSN directory file to produce the updated local DSN directory file . For instance the second DS processing unit adds an entry corresponding to a pathname of lists stored at a source name of 90DE with a corresponding local directory revision level of 3 e.g. one level greater than the previous revision level of 2 . The second DS processing unit dispersed storage encodes the updated local DSN directory file to produce a set of updated directory slices generates the set of write slice requests and sends the set of write slice requests to the DSN memory to facilitate storing the updated directory slices in the DSN memory by the second DS processing unit .

The set of write slice requests includes a pillar width number of write slice requests wherein each write slice requests of the pillar width number of write slice requests includes a slice name a revision level indicator and slice data. For example the set of write slice requests includes slice names revision level indicators for local directory revision level of 3 and 5 updated encoded directory slices. The 5 updated encoded directory slices are stored in DS units and are available for retrieval to produce the global DSN directory file .

At path the first DS processing unit retrieves the set of updated directory slices from DS units and dispersed storage error decodes the updated directory slices to produce the global DSN directory file . The global DSN directory file includes one or more directory file entries that populate each of the pathname field the source name field and the extended data field . For example the first DS processing unit produces the global DSN directory file that is substantially the same as the updated local DSN directory file produced by the second DS processing unit.

The first DS processing unit determines whether the revision level of the local DSN directory file compares favorably to the revision level of the global DSN directory file by identifying at least one revision mismatch of a plurality of possible revision mismatch . The plurality of possible revision mismatches includes a slice to slice revision mismatch wherein the mismatch is identified by detecting a slice revision mismatch between a directory slice of the local slice table and a corresponding directory slice of a set of directory slices that make up the global DSN directory file a slice to file revision mismatch wherein the mismatch is identified by detecting a revision mismatch between the a directory slice of the local slice table and a revision level of the global DSN directory file a file to file revision mismatch wherein the mismatch is identified by detecting a revision mismatch between a revision level of the local DSN directory file and a revision level of the global DSN directory file and a file to slice revision mismatch wherein the mismatch is identified by detecting a revision mismatch between a revision level of the local DSN directory file and a corresponding directory slice of the set of directory slices that make up the global DSN directory file .

A first state includes when the local directory is stale. A second state includes when the local directory is not stale e.g. currently stored in the cache memory and does not require verification . The verification verifies that a revision level of a local directory stored in the cache memory compares favorably to a revision level of a global directory retrieved from the DSN memory wherein the local directory stored in the cache is associated with the global directory retrieved from the DSN memory e.g. a favorable comparison indicates that the local directory stored in the cache is substantially the same as the global directory retrieved from the DSN memory when synchronized . A third state includes a local directory unknown staleness state e.g. when the local directory requires verification .

Entry into the first state includes an entry path from any state including when detecting a new directory entry e.g. one or more entries of one or more directory files is created detecting a directory modification detecting that a directory is not stored in the cache memory detecting an unfavorable checked write response message has been received and detecting a directory entry is deleted from the cache memory. For example a new directory entry is detected when reading a parent directory to attach the new directory entry that associates the new directory entry with the first state. As another example the global directory is retrieved from the DSN memory and a revision level comparison of the global directory in the local directory stored in the cache memory does not compare favorably.

A determination is made whether to read the global directory from the DSN memory when the local directory is associated with the first state and a read of the global directory has not been initiated. The determination may be based on one or more of a state indicator indicating the first state for the directory a time period since a last read sequence and a number of directories associated with the first state where the read of the directory has not been initiated is greater than a read directory threshold number. For example a determination is made to read the global directory from the DSN memory when five directories are associated with the first state the read of the five directories has not been initiated and the read directory threshold number is four. One or more read requests messages are sent to the DSN memory to retrieve the plurality of sets of directory slices of the global directory.

Entry into the second state includes when a favorable number of read response messages are received from the DSN memory regarding the one or more read request message to retrieve the plurality of sets of directory slices of the global directory and when a directory verification is favorable. For example a decode threshold number of read response messages are received from the DSN memory that includes directory slices of the global directory. The directory slices are dispersed storage error decoded to produce the global directory. The global directory is stored in the cache memory as an updated local directory by at least one of storing the global directory in the cache memory storing the at least some of the directory slices in the cache memory dispersed storage error encoding the directory to produce new directory slices and storing the new directory slices in the cache memory.

Entry into the third state includes when verification of the local directory stored in the cache memory is required. For example a determination is made that the verification timer associated with the directory has expired and the local directory is associated with the third state. A determination is made whether to initiate verification of the local directory when the local directory is associated with the third state and a verification has not been initiated. The determination may be based on one or more of a state indicator indicating the third state for the local directory a time period since a last verification sequence and a number of directories associated with the third state where the verification of the local directory has not been initiated is greater than a directory verification threshold number. For example a determination is made to initiate the verification of the local directory when one directory is associated with the third state the verification of the one directory has not been initiated and the directory verification threshold number is zero.

The verification of the directory is initiated by sending one or more DSN concurrency requests e.g. checked read operations to the DSN memory to retrieve slice name and revision information of the global directory. Slice name and revision information is received from the DSN memory regarding the global directory. A favorable verification is made when the slice name and revision information compares favorably to slice name and revision information of the local directory retrieved from the cache memory. The directory is associated with the second state when the verification is favorable. The verification timer is restarted associated with the local directory. The local directory is deleted from the cache memory and the local directory is associated with the first state when the verification is unfavorable.
