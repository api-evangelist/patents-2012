E mail allows people to communicate with others around the world using the Internet. Unfortunately the growth of the Internet has resulted in growth of the problem of spam or junk e mail. Junk e mail is unsolicited unwelcome e mail that is a problem facing every Internet user. It is annoying unwanted and can often be fraudulent or offensive.

Subscribers to online service providers are often targets of spammers and hackers who attempt to gain access to confidential information including for example screen names passwords and credit card information. One tactic employed by many spammers and hackers is impersonating official personnel in order to trick the subscriber into providing confidential information.

In one general aspect electronic data is transmitted by receiving at a communications system host electronic data transmitted from a sender and addressed to an intended recipient authenticating the electronic data based on attributes of the electronic data and appending information to the electronic data indicating that the electronic data has been authenticated.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the sender of the electronic data may be identified using for example a screen name and or an IP address. A level of security corresponding to the sender of the electronic data may be designated and whether one attribute of the electronic data is an attribute of an authorized sender may be verified. The attribute may be a screen name and or an IP address. Contents of the electronic data may be stored in a first storage area of the communications system host and attributes of the electronic data may be stored in a second storage area of the communications system host.

The appended information may be presented to the intended recipient with attributes of the electronic data and or contents of the electronic data. The intended recipient may render the appended information as an icon and or as a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include a border indicative of verification around the contents of the electronic data.

In another general aspect electronic data are transmitted from a sender to an intended recipient through a communications system that authenticates the electronic data based on attributes of the electronic data. In particular information indicating that the electronic data has been authenticated is received from a communications systems host and information is rendered to the intended recipient so as to inform the intended recipient that the electronic data have been authenticated.

The intended recipient may be presented with the information as an icon and or as a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include a border indicative of verification around the contents of the electronic data. The information may be rendered with contents of the electronic data and or attributes of the electronic data.

In another general aspect a graphical user interface for rendering information associated with electronic data transmitted from a sender to an intended recipient includes a distinctive border around contents of the electronic data. The graphical user interface displays the border to the intended recipient so as to inform the intended recipient that the electronic data has been authenticated.

Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host device includes a login server for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system and other elements of the host device . The host device also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP Online Service Provider host complex and IM Instant Messaging host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers the client system includes communication software for example an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber s interactions with the respective services and in particular may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.

Typically the OSP host complex supports different services such as email discussion groups chat news services and Internet access. The OSP host complex is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols i.e. standards formats conventions rules and structures to transfer data. The OSP host complex ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common underlying proprietary protocol.

The IM host complex is generally independent of the OSP host complex and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber s network or Internet access. Thus the IM host complex allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex may support associated services such as administrative matters advertising directory services chat and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data the IM host complex employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.

The host device may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes such as the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex with the IM host complex through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily when used to facilitate a link between complexes the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance the OSP host complex and IM host complex generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway and or the IM host complex gateway .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link .

In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively. However describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . For purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex the delivery network is generally a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the IM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an IM client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the IM host complex and the Internet .

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

The OSP host complex supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex generally may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example servers may be arranged in centralized or localized clusters in order to distribute servers and subscribers within the OSP host complex .

In the implementation of the OSP host complex includes a routing processor . In general the routing processor will examine an address field of a data request use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request and direct the data request to the appropriate destination. In a packet based implementation the client system may generate information requests convert the requests into data packets sequence the data packets perform error checking and other packet switching techniques and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system the routing processor may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . For example in the event that a data request from the client system can be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request to a local server . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request externally to the Internet or the IM host complex through the gateway .

The OSP host complex also includes a proxy server for directing data requests and or otherwise facilitating communication between the client system and the Internet through. The proxy server may include an IP Internet Protocol tunnel for converting data from OSP protocol into standard Internet protocol and transmitting the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel also converts data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the converted data to the routing processor for delivery back to the client system .

The proxy server also may allow the client system to use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the OSP host complex and the Internet . For example the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system to generate a request in standard Internet protocol such as HTTP HyperText Transport Protocol . In a packet based implementation data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol such as for example UDP User Datagram Protocol and routed to the proxy server . The proxy server may include a L2TP Layer Two Tunneling Protocol tunnel capable of establishing a point to point protocol PPP session with the client system .

The proxy server also may act as a buffer between the client system and the Internet and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example the proxy server can check parental controls settings of the client system and request and transmit content from the Internet according to the parental control settings. In addition the proxy server may include one or more caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches the proxy server may send the information to the client system from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link . Client system typically includes one or more client devices and one or more client controllers for controlling the client devices . Host system typically includes one or more host devices and one or more host controllers for controlling the host devices . The communications link may include communication pathways enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown the client system may access the Internet through the host system .

Examples of each element within the communication system of are broadly described above with respect to . In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively. However describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . For purposes of communicating with the IM host complex the delivery network is generally a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the IM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an OSP client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex and the Internet respectively.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host system includes a login server capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems to various elements of the host system including an OSP host complex and an IM host complex . The login server may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

To access the IM host complex to begin an instant messaging session the client system establishes a connection to the login server . The login server typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex the login server employs a hashing technique on the subscriber s screen name to identify a particular IM server for use during the subscriber s session. The login server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular IM server gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie and breaks the connection. The client system then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server through the communications link and obtains access to that IM server using the encrypted key. Typically the client system will be equipped with a Winsock API Application Programming Interface that enables the client system to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .

Once a connection to the IM server has been established the client system may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers may support associated services such as for example administrative matters directory services chat and interest groups. In general the purpose of the domain servers is to lighten the load placed on the IM server by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server and or the domain server a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers buddies are online exchange instant messages with particular subscribers participate in group chat rooms trade files such as pictures invitations or documents find other subscribers with similar interests get customized news and stock quotes and search the Web.

In the implementation of the IM server is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway facilitates the connection between the IM server and one or more alert multiplexors for example by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general an alert multiplexor maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.

Once the client system is connected to the alert multiplexor a subscriber can register for and or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system and the alert multiplexor is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server to identify the particular alert multiplexor to be used for the subscriber s session. Once the particular multiplexor has been identified the IM server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor and gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie . The client system then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor through the communication link and obtains access to the alert multiplexor using the encrypted key.

The alert multiplexor is connected to an alert gate that like the IM host complex gateway is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate is the interface between the IM host complex and the physical servers such as servers in the OSP host complex where state changes are occurring. In general the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However the alert multiplexor also may communicate with the OSP host complex through the IM gateway for example to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex with certain information gathered from the alert gate .

The alert gate can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate may include a piece of code alert receive code capable of interacting with another piece of code alert broadcast code on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general the alert receive code installed on the alert gate instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed the alert gate contacts the alert multiplexor which in turn informs the client system of the detected alert feed.

In the implementation of the IM host complex also includes a subscriber profile server connected to a database for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server may be used to enter retrieve edit manipulate or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation a subscriber s profile data includes for example the subscriber s buddy list alert preferences designated stocks identified interests and geographic location. The subscriber may enter edit and or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system to interact with the subscriber profile server .

Because the subscriber s data is stored in the IM host complex the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex using new or a different client system . Accordingly when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex the IM server can instruct the subscriber profile server to retrieve the subscriber s profile data from the database and to provide for example the subscriber s buddy list to the IM server and the subscriber s alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link . Client system typically includes one or more client devices and one or more client controllers for controlling the client devices . Host system typically includes one or more host devices and one or more host controllers for controlling the host devices . The communication link may include communication pathways enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . The network may be any known or described delivery network including but not limited to a telephone network and or the Internet.

Examples of each element within the communication system of are broadly described above with respect to . In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable the host system and shown in and may illustrate one possible implementation of those systems. describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of the host device .

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is capable of establishing a connection to the host system through the delivery network . In one implementation the client controller includes one or more applications such as an IM application an OSP application and or an internet browser application.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host device includes a mail gateway having a send mail server and a read mail server . The send mail server is configured to perform functions relating to transmitting electronic data. The read mail server is configured to perform functions relating to receiving and necessary electronics data. The mail gateway is in communication with one or more processing servers .

The mail gateway also is in communication with the storage area and a tandem database . The storage area includes electronic content databases and attachment database . The tandem database includes a system of folders that stores electronic data for subscribers of the host system .

Referring to a sender a recipient and a host interact according to a procedure to transmit electronic data. The procedure may be implemented by any type of hardware software device computer computer system equipment component program application code storage medium or propagated signal.

Examples of each element of are broadly described above with respects to . In particular the sender and the recipient typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client devices and and or client controllers and . The host typically has attributes comparable to those described above with respect to host devices and and or host controllers and . The sender the recipient and or the host may be directly or indirectly interconnected through a known or described delivery network.

Initially the sender transmits electronic data to the host step . In one implementation the sender aids client system transmitting electronic data through a communications link to the host system . In another implementation the sender is a processing server within the host system . For example the processing server may be a server arranged to send a welcome message to new subscribers to the host system .

The host receives the electronic data from the sender step . In one implementation the mail gateway receives the electronic data from the client system and or the processing server . Typically the mail gateway will receive electronic content from subscribers through a telephone network and will receive electronic content from non subscribers through the Internet.

After the host receives the electronic data from the sender step the host determines attributes of the electronic data step . In one implementation the read mail server of the mail gateway determines attributes of the electronic data including the author of the electronic data the recipient s of the electronic data the subject of the electronic data the date and time of the transmission and or whether the electronic data contains attachments or embedded images.

The host authenticates the electronic data based on one or more attributes step . Typically only selected users will be authorized to transmit authenticated electronic data. For example operations security personnel may selectively authorize certain employees and or process servers to transmit authenticated electronic data based on criteria. Criteria may include the purpose the process the security and or the internal account of the sender.

After the electronic data has been authenticated step the host designates a level of security for the electronic data step . In one implementation the authenticated electronic data is designated as either official or unofficial. In other implementations however there may be several different levels of security. Additionally the electronic data may be designated as being sent from a particular business partner of the OSP.

The host then appends information to the electronic data indicating that the electronic data has been authenticated step . In one implementation bits of information are inserted into the header of the electronic data. The appended information may correspond to the particular level of security of the sender

Next the host stores the contents and attributes of the electronic data step . In one implementation contents of the electronic data are stored in the storage area and the attributes of the electronic data are stored in the tandem database . More particularly the body of the electronic data is stored in electronic content databases and any attachments are stored in the attachment database . In this example the body of the electronic data is stored twice to insure availability of the electronic data body. Due to the typically large sizes of attachments however such objects are only stored once to conserve memory space.

The tandem database includes a system of folders corresponding to the subscribers of the host system . Each folder may have properties assigned by the subscriber including for example properties for filtering electronic content from certain sources. As electronic data is received the folder stores the attributes of the electronic data including the location s of the electronic data content in the storage area .

When the recipient desires to access stored electronic data the recipient sends a request to access the electronic data to the host step . The host receives the request to access the electronic data from the recipient step . The host sends the appended information to the recipient step . The appended information may be presented to the recipient with the attributes of the electronic data and or the contents of the electronic data.

When presented with the appended information the recipient renders the appended information to a user step . The appended information may be rendered as a distinguishable icon in a listing of folder entries and or a distinguishable chrome i.e. border around the contents of the electronic data in a message. In one implementation the chrome is distinguishable by being a different color from regular messages e.g. unofficial email and by including words and or symbols relating to its authenticated status.

Referring to a UI illustrates an example of how the appended information may be rendered. The UI includes an Online Mailbox template . The Online Mailbox template includes a New Mail folder for displaying attributes of received messages. Such attributes includes but are not limited to the date the message was received the sender of the message and the subject of the message.

As shown in the New Mail folder displays attributes of two received messages. The first message is a product update message received from a particular supplier and the second message is an official message received from an authenticated sender of official mail. The first message is associated with a first icon and the second message is associated with a second icon . The first icon and the second icon are distinguishable from each other by color and symbol. Namely the first icon appears as a yellow envelope and the second icon appears as a blue envelope including the AOL triangle.

In one implementation the first icon is a standard icon associated with all unofficial messages and the second icon is a special icon associated only with official messages. In another implementation the particular subscriber is authenticated and the first icon is associated with all messages received from the authenticated supplier. In such an implementation the first icon is distinguishable from other special icons associated with authenticated messages e.g. the second icon as well as the standard icon associated with unauthenticated messages.

Referring to a UI A associated with an authenticated message e.g. official mail is distinguishable from a UI B associated with an unauthenticated message e.g. unofficial mail . The UI A includes an Official AOL Mail template A having a distinguishable border A. In contrast the UI B includes an Unofficial Mail template B having a standard border B. As shown the color of the border A e.g. light blue differs from the color e.g. white of the border B. In addition the border A includes an Official AOL Mail seal A in the lower left corner of the Official AOL Mail template A. Such a seal is conspicuously absent from the border B of the Unofficial Mail template B.

The general aspects described above may be applied to either an e mail message and or an instant message. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
