The current disclosure relates to small form factor pluggable SFP transceivers and more specifically but not exclusively to SFP transceivers used for connecting client premises equipment to an optical data network.

Optical data networks are used to provide high speed and high throughput data communication to clients. The backbone of an optical data network uses optical fibers which carry light to transmit data among network hubs and central offices of an optical network provider s access network. The optical network backbone connects to a client s premises via a metropolitan access segment that uses a fiber optic cable from a proximate central office. The network segment from the central office to the client s premises is sometimes referred to as the first mile as viewed from the client s perspective or the last mile as viewed from the provider s perspective although the actual distance typically ranges from dozens of meters up to a few dozen kilometers.

At the client premises the optical fiber connects to a network interface device NID that i demarcates the boundary between the provider s access network which is the provider s responsibility and the client s local network which is the client s responsibility and ii provides interconnectivity and translation as needed between the provider s optical network and the client s optical equipment. In other words a typical NID connects from a first type optical network suitable for medium distance transmission to a second type optical network suitable for short distance transmission. Note that i a NID is also known as a demarcation device and ii an access network is also known as a transport network. Note further that in some fiber optic network setups one entity a network provider manages the physical fiber optic network while a separate entity a service provider provides optical data services over that network to clients such as end users. In the latter type of setups additional network devices might be required at the client premises because of the plurality of parties involved in the provision and use of the network services.

The logical processing performed internally by a NID is done electronically as opposed to optically using integrated circuit IC chips. Consequently the NID performs optical to electrical o e and electrical to optical e o signal conversions in order to perform electronic processing while receiving and transmitting optical signals. These conversions are typically performed by SFP transceivers which as their name suggests are small pluggable devices that connect to an optical cable at a first connective interface and plug into corresponding receptacles sometimes called cages of an electronic device such as a NID connecting at a second connective interface. Industry wide specifications for SFP transceivers are determined and provided by the SFF Small Form Factor Committee an ad hoc group of electronics industry participants. One such standard for SFP transceivers is INF 8074i available at ftp ftp.seagate.com sff INF 8074.PDF incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Optical transceiver connects to controller via path . Connector connects to controller via path . Connector is adapted to plug into a corresponding connector of a host electronic device not shown and communicate via signal path . Controller provides basic control functions for the operation of SFP transceiver and interconnects the internal components of SFP transceiver . EEPROM which is connected to controller via path stores inventory data such as for example model name and serial number. The host typically comprises a serializer deserializer SerDes for the conversion of parallel signals on the user equipment side to from serial signals used on the service provider side. Path also provides electrical power to SFP transceiver .

NID is powered via a connection to a regular electrical power socket. Since the internal processing performed by NID is performed electronically while communication to CO node and client device is performed optically NID uses two SFP transceivers namely SFP transceivers and which are substantially similar to SFP transceiver of . SFP transceivers and are plugged into corresponding receptacles in NID . Note that an SFP transceiver receptacle such as the receptacles of NID includes an electrical connector which makes direct physical contact with the electrical connector of the corresponding SFP transceiver when the SFP transceiver is plugged into the receptacle. SFP transceiver connects via optical fiber to CO node and SFP transceiver connects via optical fiber to client device . NID may include LEDs corresponding to SFP transceivers and which indicate for example whether the corresponding link is up or down based on a determination made by NID .

The demarcation between the provider s network and the client s network is represented in by dotted line . The physical port or interface that forms the boundary between the two networks is known as a user network interface UNI . The part of the network provider s equipment that performs and controls the UNI is sometimes designated as UNI N while the part of the customer s equipment that performs UNI functions is sometimes designated as UNI C. Standard features for UNIs are defined by the Metro Ethernet Forum MEF . In network segment the UNI would be where SFP transceiver connects to optical cable since optical cable is the client s responsibility as are SFP transceiver and client device while SFP transceiver is the network provider s responsibility as are NID SFP transceiver and optical cable . Using SFP transceiver and optical cable NID provides an optical connection to client device . Client device uses SFP transceiver also similar to SFP transceiver of to connect to local optical fiber and convert between optical and electrical signals. Client device may be for example a network router connected to the client s local area network.

One embodiment of the disclosure can be a pluggable device adapted to plug into a receptacle of a client network device. The pluggable device comprises a an optical transceiver configured to i optically connect to a provider network node via a first optical link ii convert incoming downlink optical signals received from the network node via the first optical link into incoming downlink electrical signals and iii convert outgoing uplink electrical signals into outgoing uplink optical signals for transmission to the network node via the first optical link b an electrical connector configured to i electrically connect to the receptacle of the client network device ii transmit outgoing downlink electrical signals to the client network device via the receptacle and iii receive incoming uplink electrical signals from the client network device via the receptacle and c a processing module configured to process one or more of i the incoming downlink electrical signals and ii the incoming uplink electrical signals to implement at least one operations administration and maintenance OAM function.

Another embodiment of the disclosure can be a provider network node configured to a optically connect to a client network device via i a first optical link and a ii pluggable device configured to plug into a receptacle of the client network device and b remotely manage the pluggable device via the first optical link. The pluggable device comprises a an optical transceiver configured to i optically connect to the provider network node via the first optical link ii convert incoming downlink optical signals received from the network node via the first optical link into incoming downlink electrical signals and iii convert outgoing uplink electrical signals into outgoing uplink optical signals for transmission to the network node via the first optical link b an electrical connector configured to i electrically connect to the receptacle of the client network device ii transmit outgoing downlink electrical signals to the client network device via the receptacle and iii receive incoming uplink electrical signals from the client network device via the receptacle and c a processing module configured to process one or more of i the incoming downlink electrical signals and ii the incoming uplink electrical signals to implement at least one operations administration and maintenance OAM function.

Yet another embodiment of the disclosure can be a method for a pluggable device comprising an optical transceiver an electrical connector and a processing module. The method comprises a the pluggable device automatically powering up in response to the pluggable device being plugged into a receptacle of a client network device wherein the electrical connector is configured to i electrically connect to the receptacle ii convert incoming downlink optical signals received from a network provider node via a first optical link into incoming downlink electrical signals and iii convert outgoing uplink electrical signals into outgoing uplink optical signals for transmission to the network provider node via the first optical link b the pluggable device receiving and processing a discovery message from the provider network node after connection of the first optical link to the optical transceiver wherein the optical transceiver is configured to i optically connect to the provider network node via the first optical link ii convert incoming downlink optical signals received from the network node via the first optical link into incoming downlink electrical signals and iii convert outgoing uplink electrical signals into outgoing uplink optical signals for transmission to the network node via the first optical link c the pluggable device receiving one or more configuration instructions from the provider network node and d the pluggable device setting one or more parameters of the pluggable device in response to the received one or more configuration instructions from the provider network node.

Miniaturizing and integrating certain selected functions typically performed by a NID into a smart SFP SSFP transceiver may provide for a compact low power relatively inexpensive device that would allow for the elimination of the NID from a client site and the reduction of the number of SFP transceivers used at the client site from three such as SFP transceivers and in to one SSFP transceiver. The reduction of devices from three SFP transceivers and one NID to only one SSFP transceiver should reduce purchase installation and maintenance costs and increase the reliability of the optical network system at the client site. In addition the replacement of the NID and three SFP combination with a single smart SFP transceiver allows for the provision of fiber optic connectivity to locations with limited space and or electrical power outlets. This is possible because an SSFP transceiver like a typical SFP transceiver is mated to and receives electrical power from its host device and consequently does not require an additional power outlet or a significant volume of additional space.

Furthermore an SSFP transceiver may provide various advanced features to locations where otherwise provision of such services would be impractical due to cost and or space limitations. Among such advanced features is for example automatic setup and configuration of the SSFP transceiver upon connection to both the service provider s network and the client network device. Another possible benefit of the use of an SSFP transceiver instead of several prior art devices is the elimination of a need for interoperability testing for an agglomeration of several prior art devices where the devices may have been procured from different vendors with potentially conflicting implementations of features. Note that not all features of a NID such as NID of need or should be integrated into a smart SFP transceiver since some of those features may 1 be unnecessary for a particular application and or 2 require power or size expenditures alone or in combination that exceed what the smart SFP transceiver may practically provide.

Client device is similar and may be identical to client device of . Client device does not need to be aware that SSFP transceiver is a smart SFP transceiver and can interact with SSFP transceiver as if SSFP transceiver were conventional SFP transceiver of . In other words client device may be used with SSFP transceiver without any modification or software upgrade of client device . The above may be made possible by having the electrical connector side of SSFP transceiver compliant with the above mentioned SFF standards. Demarcation line indicating the boundary between the network provider s network and the client network is shown as a dotted line. In the typical setup where the network provider maintains and manages SSFP transceiver the demarcation line is the electrical interface of SSFP transceiver where SSFP transceiver connects to client network device . Note that during typical operation this demarcation line is technically inside client network device indicated by the callout coming out of network device and surrounding SSFP transceiver which may warrant some modification of usual responsibility divisions between service provider and client.

At client location optical cable connects to smart SFP transceiver which plugs into client network device . Client network device may be an Ethernet local area network LAN switch a packet switched network router a Node B cellular transceiver a digital subscriber line access multiplexer DSLAM or any other suitable type of client network device. Note that the client may be for example an end user of the service provider or alternatively a business unit of the service provider that happens to be an internal client of the service provider s transport service.

Smart SFP transceiver combines selected functions previously performed by NID and the three SFP transceivers and of in the physical form factor of a single SSFP transceiver. Other selected functions previously performed by NID may instead be performed remotely by central office node . The particular functions provided by respectively smart SFP transceiver and central office node depend on the particular embodiment. In one embodiment smart SFP transceiver provides 1 physical and logical demarcation between the provider s network and the client s network and 2 media conversion to from optical signaling from to electrical signaling.

SSFP transceiver comprises optical transceiver electrical connector and EEPROM which are similar to their counterparts in SFP transceiver namely optical transceiver electrical connector and EEPROM respectively. SSFP transceiver further comprises protocol processing engine central processing unit CPU flash memory Serializer Deserializer SerDes power manager and LED module . The functions of controller of SFP transceiver which are relatively limited and simple are performed by protocol processing engine which also implements additional functionality described elsewhere herein.

Protocol processing engine connects to optical transceiver via path and to flash memory via path . Protocol processing engine may be implemented for example as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a field programmable gate array FPGA . CPU may also be implemented for example as an ASIC or an FPGA. Note that two or more of the components of SSFP transceiver such as for example protocol processing engine and CPU may be integrated on a single ASIC or FPGA chip.

CPU and protocol processing engine allow SSFP transceiver to perform a variety of advanced functions that are not available from SFP transceiver of . Examples of these advanced features are provided below. The functions provided by as well as the particular circuitry of CPU as well as other components of SSFP transceiver may vary depending on implementation and or on the type of network in which SSFP transceiver is used. CPU connects to protocol processing engine via path . CPU connects to electrical connector and EEPROM via path . SerDes connects to protocol processing engine via path and to electrical connector via path

A SerDes such as SerDes converts between serially transmitted data and data transmitted in parallel. In SSFP transceiver path transmits data serially while path represents a plurality of parallel interfaces between SerDes and electrical connector . Flash memory is a rewritable non volatile memory that is used by CPU in the provision of one or more SSFP transceiver features.

Power manager monitors power usage by components of SSFP transceiver . Power manager also performs DC DC voltage conversion from the voltage level provided via electrical connector to the voltage level used by components such as protocol processing engine . CPU and protocol processing engine operate to keep the electrical power usage by SSFP transceiver at or below a predetermined level such as for example 1.5 watts which complies with the limits specified by the above noted SFF specification for SFP transceivers.

LED module is connected to CPU via path and comprises one or more light emitting diodes LEDs in one or more corresponding colors that may be used to indicate various statuses for SSFP transceiver . LED module might simply replicate statuses previously determined and provided by a host device such as NID of FIG. e.g. link up down status. LED module might also indicate any one of a plurality of other statuses determined by SSFP transceiver such as power up status whether a particular service is active or if a particular set of conditions has been met. Note that LED module is an optional module for SSFP transceiver and some implementations of SSFP transceiver do not include an LED module. In one implementation optical transceiver i has a single optical port for a single optical fiber and ii comprises LED module . In one alternative implementation optical transceiver i has two optical ports for two corresponding optical fibers and ii does not include an LED module.

In one implementation SSFP transceiver is used to provide Ethernet in the First Mile EFM Link OAM as described in Clause 57 of Part 3 of IEEE Standard 802.3 available from the IEEE at http standards.ieee.org about get 802 802.3.html incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the EFM implementation central office node implements EFM active side functions such as sending EFM OAM packets. SSFP transceiver on the other hand implements EFM passive side functions such as receiving and responding to EFM OAM packets received from central office node . Additional exemplary EFM functions that may be performed by SSFP transceiver include 1 responding to OAM discovery messages as described elsewhere herein 2 participation in the detection of link connectivity 3 providing loopback support i.e. enabling or disabling loopback in response to corresponding commands from the active end 4 event notifications for particular system events and 5 providing dying gasp notification which may provide diagnostic information to CO node upon an unexpected power failure affecting SSFP transceiver . These OAM features are further described for example in the above referenced 802.3ah standard.

In another implementation SSFP transceiver is used to provide continuity fault management CFM Service OAM as described in IEEE Std. 802.1ag 2007 available at http standards.ieee.org findstds standard 802.1ag 2007.html incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Note that these standards have been incorporated into IEEE Std. 802.1 2011 as Clauses 18 22. Note that the IEEE Std. 802.1ag 2007 CFM standard is substantially similar to a subset of ITU T International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector Recommendation Y.1731 available at http www.itu.int rec T REC Y.1731 en incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Note that ITU T Y.1731 provides CFM with additional fault management and performance management PM functions. Note further that these standards are also referenced in Metro Ethernet Forum MEF Service OAM specifications.

In the CFM embodiment which implements IEEE Std. 802.1ag 2007 and or ITU T Y.1731 features SSFP transceiver implements various CFM and PM functions. These CFM and PM functions may include sending continuity check messages CCMs responding to loopback LB messages providing remote defect indication RDI performance management functions including loss measurement LM synthetic LM SLM and delay measurement DM and remote configuration by a remote management agent RMA of MEG end point MEP parameters such as for example MEG level MEG ID MEP direction MEP ID local MEP ID remote MEP enable CCM enable CCM interval LM message LMM interval DM message DMM interval SLM interval LB enable and any other configurable parameter used by ITU T Y.1731 and or IEEE Std. 802.1ag 2007. Note that RMAs are described in further detail below.

In one embodiment SSFP transceiver supports the performance of Ethernet service activation implemented in accordance with at least one of i ITU T Recommendation Y.1564 available at http www.itu.int rec T REC Y.1564 201103 I en incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and ii MEF Latching Loopback protocol described in the MEF Technical Specification for Latching Loopback Protocol and Functionality.

In certain implementations of the disclosure such as any of the ones described herein SSFP transceiver implements two port media access control MAC relay TPMR functionality as described in IEEE Std. 802.1aj available at http www.ieee.org.tr findstds standard 802.1aj 2009.html incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. SSFP transceiver functions as a TPMR bridge with two ports a customer interface CIF namely electrical connector and a network interface NIF namely optical transceiver . The bridging function is transparent to at least some Ethernet layer 2 L2 control protocols. The bridging function is also transparent to Ethernet virtual local area network VLAN protocol. Note that Ethernet quality of service QoS functionality might be excluded.

In TPMR implementations SSFP transceiver includes Ethernet port Performance Monitoring PM counters for either or both the customer interface CIF and the network interface NIF . The PM counters may count the numbers of among others i incoming error free frames and octets ii incoming frames with errors due to for example frame check sequence FCS errors or frame length errors iii frame drops due to for example buffer overflow and iv outgoing frames and octets. In addition PM counters for the NIF may count i near end symbols with errors and or ii frames with errors. The various counter values may be retrieved and or reset remotely by an RMA as described below located at CO node .

In one implementation of the disclosure such as any of the ones described herein SSFP transceiver may include a Digital Diagnostics Monitor DDM which collects and maintains DDM statistics which provide physical layer data for the SSFP. The DDM allows for remote monitoring by for example CO node of FIG. of various physical layer characteristics for SSFP transceiver such as transmit power temperatures and voltage levels.

Management module uses standard protocols such as for example simple network management protocol SNMP to send and receive network management information and commands. Management module functions as an intermediary and interface between NMS and RMA module . RMA module provides the proxy remote management features described elsewhere herein. Packet driver connects CO node to one or more SSFP transceivers such as SSFP transceiver at client sites such as client site . Packet driver may be implemented for example as an application programming interface API for an Ethernet switch. RMA module controls packet driver to modify as needed data packets handled by packet driver . Packet driver is shown connected to an exemplary plurality of SSFP transceivers not shown via respective paths and . Note that intermediary network elements such as for example network nodes may be included in the physical path between CO node and one or more of the SSFP transceivers to which it is connected but these elements transparently forward the management data packets between CO node and the one or more SSFP transceivers. Also note that CO node may be connected to only one SSFP transceiver.

Note that while NID of has its own IP internet protocol address and operates as a separate network element NE SSFP transceiver does not in this implementation have its own IP address and appears to NMS and CO node as a remote port extender for a client port of CO node which is a port of packet driver of FIG. and not as a separate NE with its own IP address. Note further that CO node may manage SSFP transceiver using a lightweight protocol i.e. a protocol that is simpler than the typical protocol for remotely managing a NID such as SNMP over Ethernet or SNMP over IP over Ethernet on a remote management channel separate from a data communication channel used for data transmission. As would be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art many particular implementations of a management channel and a lightweight management protocol that is simple reliable and consumes relatively little bandwidth may be used. Note that the remote management may include automatic setup of SSFP transceiver by CO node during installation of SSFP transceiver at client site .

SSFP transceiver then receives configuration instructions from CO node step . The configuration instructions may be received in several packets as part of a back and forth configuration communication between SSFP transceiver and CO node . SSFP transceiver sets one or more internal parameter values in response to the configuration instructions received from CO node step . The configuration parameters may set up for example CFM and or EFM parameters on SSFP transceiver . After the configuration is completed SSFP transceiver and CO node enter regular communication and management mode step and auto setup procedure terminates step . Regular communication and management mode includes management as needed of SSFP transceiver by CO node . Regular management also known as operational service phase may include for example alarm reporting fault localization on demand performance tests and ongoing measurement of throughput frame loss and frame delay. Note that as part of the configuration and or regular communication processes SSFP transceiver may provide status and or trouble information visible to a technician installing or inspecting SSFP transceiver by signaling with one or more of the LEDs of LED module .

In one implementation of the disclosure such as any of the ones described herein SSFP transceiver may include an Ethernet equipment clock EEC not shown which may be used to provide frequency synchronization distribution in the downstream direction i.e. from the NIF to the CIF where the EEC is compatible with the Synchronous Ethernet SyncE standard. The frequency distribution allows for the synchronization of the EEC frequency to a network clock based on a clock signal recovered at the NIF.

An embodiment of the disclosure has been described wherein NMS of is external to CO node . In some alternative embodiments NMS is within CO node . It should be noted that NMS may connect to a plurality of central office nodes regardless of whether NMS is within or external to CO node .

Embodiments of the invention have been described where service monitoring of the link between the network provider and client site of is performed by CO node . It should be noted that SSFP transceiver may also provide monitoring information to client equipment such as for example client network device . This information may be provided via electrical connector of .
