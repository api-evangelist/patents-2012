The drive supporting device the operation detecting device and the controller according to the present invention have such an effect that the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver can be realized.

Hereinafter an embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Furthermore the invention is not limited to the embodiment. Further the components of the embodiment below include a component that may be easily replaced by the person skilled in the art or a component that substantially has the same configuration.

A drive supporting device of the present embodiment illustrated in is mounted on a vehicle and has a function as an operation detecting device that is capable of executing driving support in the vehicle and that detects the operational intention of the driver based on information of a steering system of the vehicle . The drive supporting device typically determines in a distinguished manner an active operation on a steering member and a passive operation on the steering member as an operation reflecting the operational intention of the driver based on a predetermined index corresponding to the information of the steering system. The drive supporting device then realizes the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver by reflecting the determination result in various controls in the vehicle .

Here the active operation on the steering member is typically an operation in which the operational intention of the driver is relatively strongly reflected. The passive operation on the steering member is on the other hand typically an operation in which the steering intention of the driver is relatively weakly reflected for example a negative operation corresponding to disturbance and stability compensation. More specifically the active operation on the steering member may include for example a positive steering operation in which the driver attempts to move the vehicle to a target position. The active operation is typically a state of actively carrying out work or a state in which so called myoelectricity is being generated a state in which a command is actively being output from the brain and the like and for example is an operation of gripping the steering member and putting force to steer the steering member thus shifting the vehicle from a straight ahead advancing state to a turning state. The passive operation on the steering member on the other hand may include a steering operation in which the driver attempts to maintain the vehicle at a target position with respect to disturbance a hands free operation in which the hand is freed from the steering member a steering hold operation in which the steering member is held to maintain the advancing direction of the vehicle constant and the like for example. The passive operation is for example an operation that can correspond to road surface disturbance and the like by placing the hand on the steering member.

The drive supporting device of the present embodiment reflects the determination result of the active operation and the passive operation based on the steering power in a driving support control of the steering system of the vehicle . The drive supporting device thereby carries out for example the control e.g. assist control dumping control hysteresis applying control etc. associated with maintaining the steering performance that does not depend on the properties of the driver.

Specifically as illustrated in the drive supporting device includes a supporting device mounted on the vehicle and capable of executing the driving support in the vehicle a steering angle sensor serving as a steering angle detecting device a torque sensor serving as a torque detecting device and an ECU serving as a controller that controls the supporting device . The steering angle sensor detects a steering angle of a steering wheel hereinafter simply referred to as a steering unless particularly stated otherwise serving as the steering member of the vehicle . The torque sensor detects the torque acting on a steering shaft hereinafter simply referred to as a shaft unless particularly stated otherwise serving as a steering shaft portion that rotates with the steering . The ECU is also used as a determining device of the operation detecting device. The supporting device of the present embodiment is configured to include a steering device configuring the steering system of the vehicle .

Here the steering device is a device mounted on the vehicle to steer a steering wheel of the vehicle . The steering device of the present embodiment is a so called electrical power steering device EPS Electronic Power Steering that aids the steering force of the vehicle with power from an electrical motor and the like. The steering device drives the electrical motor and the like to obtain a steering auxiliary force corresponding to the steering force exerted on the steering from the driver to aid the steering operation steering operation of the driver.

Specifically as illustrated in the steering device includes the steering serving as the steering member the shaft serving as the steering shaft portion an R P gear mechanism hereinafter simply referred to as a gear mechanism unless particularly described otherwise a pair of left and right tie rods and an EPS device serving as a steering actuator.

The steering is a member that is rotatably operable in a direction about a rotation axis line X and is arranged at a driver s seat of the vehicle . The driver can perform the steering operation steering operation by rotatably operating the steering with the rotation axis line X as the center of rotation. That is in the vehicle on which the steering device is mounted the steering wheel is steered rolled when the steering is operated by the driver.

The shaft serves as the rotation shaft unit of the steering . The shaft has one end coupled to the steering and the other end coupled to the gear mechanism . That is the steering is connected to the gear mechanism via the shaft . The shaft is rotatable in a direction about the center axis line with the steering accompanying the rotational operation of the steering by the driver. The shaft for example may be divided into a plurality of members such as an upper shaft an intermediate shaft and a lower shaft.

The gear mechanism mechanically couples the shaft and the pair of tie rods . The gear mechanism for example has a so called rack and pinion type gear mechanism and converts the rotational movement in the direction about the center axis line of the shaft to the linear movement in the left and right direction typically corresponds to the vehicle width direction of the vehicle of the pair of tie rods .

The pair of tie rods have basal ends coupled to the gear mechanism respectively and tie rod ends which form distal ends coupled to each steering wheel via a knuckle arm. That is the steering is coupled to each steering wheel via the shaft the gear mechanism each tie rod and the like.

The EPS device configures the supporting device and is a steering actuator that operates according to the steering operation on the steering . The EPS device aids the steering operation steering operation on the steering by the driver and generates the torque for aiding the steering operation. The EPS device outputs a steering auxiliary force assist torque for aiding the steering force torque input to the steering by the driver. In other words the EPS device assists the steering operation of the driver by driving the steering wheel of the vehicle with the electrical motor and the like. The EPS device assists the steering operation of the driver by causing an assist torque to act on the shaft . Here the assist torque is a torque that aids the torque corresponding to the steering force input to the steering by the driver.

The EPS device here includes a motor serving as the electrical motor and a decelerator . The EPS device of the present embodiment for example is a column EPS device in which the motor is arranged on the shaft such as the intermediate shaft that is a so called column assist type assist mechanism.

The motor is a column assist electrical motor that generates rotative power motor torque when power is supplied and for example generates the assist torque as the steering auxiliary force. The motor is connected to the shaft in a power transmissible manner via the decelerator and the like and imparts the steering auxiliary force to the shaft via the decelerator and the like. The decelerator decelerates the rotative power of the motor and transmits the power to the shaft .

The EPS device rotatably drives the motor so that the rotative power torque generated by the motor is transmitted to the shaft via the decelerator thus carrying out steering assist. In this case the rotative power generated by the motor is decelerated by the decelerator and transmitted to the shaft with the torque increased. The EPS device is electrically connected to the ECU to be described later so that the drive of the motor is controlled.

The steering angle sensor detects the steering angle of the steering as described above and is a rotation angle sensor in the steering system. The steering angle sensor detects the steering angle as an absolute angle here. The steering angle sensor detects the steering angle wheel steering angle which is the rotation angle of the steering . The steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor is detected with the counterclockwise side as a positive value and the clockwise side as a negative value with a neutral position of the steering as a reference for example but may be detected in a manner opposite thereto. It is to be noted that the neutral position of the steering is a position to become a reference of the steering angle and is typically a position of the steering of when the vehicle travels straight ahead. The steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor becomes 0 at the neutral position of the steering . The steering angle sensor is electrically connected to the ECU and outputs a detection signal corresponding to the detected steering angle to the ECU .

It is to be noted that the steering angle detecting device of the drive supporting device is not limited to the steering angle sensor and for example a rotation angle sensor that detects the rotation angle of a rotor shaft of the motor a sensor not illustrated that detects a rack stroke or a pinion rotation angle of the gear mechanism a sensor not illustrated that detects a cut angle of the steering wheel and the like may be used. In this case the steering angle detecting device may separately have a function capable of acquiring the absolute angle of the steering if it is a sensor that detects the steering angle as a relative angle such as the rotation angle sensor for example.

The torque sensor detects the torque acting on the shaft as described above. The torque sensor detects the torque acting on the shaft in other words the torque generated at the shaft here. The torque sensor detects the torque acting on a torsion bar not illustrated which is a torsion member configuring a part of the EPS device for example. The torque hereinafter sometimes referred to as a steering torque detected by the torque sensor is typically a torque reflecting the driver steering torque that acts on the shaft according to the steering force input to the steering from the driver a disturbance torque that is input to the shaft via the tie rod end from the steering wheel side according to a road surface disturbance input and the like to the steering wheel and the like. The torque detected by the torque sensor is detected with the counterclockwise side as a positive value and the clockwise side as a negative value for example but may be detected in a manner opposite thereto. The torque sensor is electrically connected to the ECU and outputs a detection signal corresponding to the detected steering torque to the ECU .

The ECU controls each unit of the vehicle on which the drive supporting device is mounted. The ECU is an electronic circuit that is configured as a well known microcomputer including a CPU a ROM a RAM and an interface. The ECU is for example electrically connected to various sensors such as the torque sensor the steering angle sensor and the rotation angle sensor described above and the EPS device . The rotation angle detected by the rotation angle sensor is used in a current control output control to the motor by the ECU for example. Here the ECU is also electrically connected to a vehicle speed sensor a yaw rate sensor and the like. The vehicle speed sensor detects the vehicle speed which is the travelling speed of the vehicle . The yaw rate sensor detects the yaw rate of the vehicle . In addition the ECU may be electrically connected to various sensors such as a current sensor that detects various types of currents and a lateral G sensor that detects the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle a detector and the like.

The ECU receives an electric signal detection signal corresponding to the detection result from the various sensors and outputs a drive signal to the EPS device according to the input detection result to control the drive thereof. The ECU is capable of executing the control of adjusting the torque generated by the EPS device based on the detected steering operation physical amount.

The ECU for example controls the EPS device based on the steering torque detected by the torque sensor and the like and adjusts and controls the assist torque generated by the EPS device and caused to act on the shaft . The ECU adjusts the output torque of the motor by adjusting the motor supply current which is the supply current to the motor and adjusts the assist torque. Here the motor supply current is a current having a magnitude with which the EPS device can generate a predetermined torque required. In this case the ECU may for example control the motor supply current to the motor based on the rotation angle detected by the rotation angle sensor and the like.

The steering device configured as described above causes the steering torque input to the steering from the driver the torque generated by the EPS device by the control of the ECU and the like to act on the shaft . When the steering force and the steering auxiliary force act on the tie rod from the shaft via the gear mechanism the steering device then causes the tie rod to be displaced in the left and right direction by an axial force of a magnitude corresponding to the driver steering torque by the driver and the torque generated by the EPS device and the steering wheel to be rolled. As a result the steering device can roll the steering wheel by the steering force input to the steering from the driver and the steering auxiliary force generated by the EPS device so that the steering operation by the driver can be aided and the burden of the driver can be alleviated in the steering operation.

The ECU of the present embodiment then determines in a distinguished manner the active operation on the steering and the passive operation on the steering based on a parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and a parameter associated with the steering torque detected by the torque sensor as a predetermined index corresponding to the information of the steering system. Here the ECU determines the active operation and the passive operation based on the steering power corresponding to a product of the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the parameter associated with the steering torque detected by the torque sensor . The ECU can also determine the active operation and the passive operation and then detect the strength thereof and apply the strength to the control.

The ECU controls the steering device configuring the supporting device based on the determination result and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device . That is the ECU controls the steering device based on the steering power corresponding to the product of the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the parameter associated with the steering torque detected by the torque sensor and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device .

The ECU may further here determine the active operation and the passive operation based on the steering work amount corresponding to a product of the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the parameter associated with the steering torque detected by the torque sensor in addition to the determination based on the steering power. That is in addition to changing the content of the driving support based on the steering power the ECU may further change the content of the driving support by the supporting device based on the steering work amount corresponding to the product of the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the parameter associated with the steering torque detected by the torque sensor .

That is the ECU of the present embodiment typically determines the active operation and the passive operation based on the steering power which is an index representing a transitional steering operation by the intention of the driver and the steering work amount which is an index representing a steady steering operation by the intention of the driver and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device in accordance therewith.

The steering power and the steering work amount used in the determination and the control by the ECU will now be described.

The steering power is an index representing the power in the steering operation of the driver on the steering and is a physical amount representing an energy used per unit time. The steering work amount is an index representing the work in the steering operation of the driver on the steering and is a physical amount representing the used energy. The relationship of a steering power P and a steering work amount W can be expressed with the following equation 1 where t indicates time. 1 

Here the steering power P is for example calculated based on one of or both of a product of a steering speed corresponds to a differential value of the steering angle corresponding to a steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and a steering torque T detected by the torque sensor and a product of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and a torque differential value T corresponding to the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor . Typically the steering power P based on the product T of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to reflect the intention of the course change and the like in the transitional steering operation by the intention of the driver. On the other hand typically the steering power P based on the product T of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to reflect the intention of the reverse input correspondence from the road surface and the like in the transitional steering operation by the intention of the driver. The ECU for example detects the active operation on the steering when the steering power P is greater than or equal to a power reference value reference value ThP set in advance and detects the passive operation on the steering when the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP.

On the other hand the steering work amount W is for example calculated based on the product of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor . Typically the steering work amount W based on the product T of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to reflect the intention to continue turning and the like in the steady steering operation by the intention of the driver. The ECU detects the active operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is greater than or equal to a work amount reference value reference value ThW set in advance and detects the passive operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

It is to be noted that the setting of the work amount reference value ThW will be described in detail later.

The extraction of the active operation and the passive operation using the steering power P will be more specifically described next.

The ECU calculates the steering power P based on one of or both of the product T of the steering speed and the steering torque T and the product T of the steering angle and the torque differential value T determines the intention of the driver on the basis thereof and reflects the same in the driving support by the supporting device steering device . The ECU may carry out the determination of the intention of the driver using either one of the steering power P based on the product T or the steering power P based on T or may individually calculate the same and carry out the determination of the intention of the driver using both steering powers. The ECU may also calculate the steering power P in which the steering power based on the product T and the steering power based on the product T are synthesized and carry out the determination of the intention of the driver. The ECU can calculate the steering power P using the following equation 2 for example. 2 

In the above equation 2 A and B are coefficients and are compatible values that can be appropriately set based on various conditions actual vehicle evaluation and the like. In the above equation 2 the ECU can arbitrarily set the coefficients A and B to make an appropriate adjustment according to the application of the steering power P to be calculated the properties of the vehicle the properties of the driver and the like for example. For example when it is desired to determine the active operation and the passive operation while reflecting the intention of course change by the intention of the driver and change the driving support the ECU can simplify the calculation equation of the steering power P by assuming that A 1 and B 0. Similarly when it is desired to determine the active operation and the passive operation while reflecting the intention of the reverse input correspondence by the intention of the driver and change the driving support the ECU can simplify the calculation equation of the steering power P by assuming that A 0 and B 1. Furthermore the ECU can calculate the steering power P in which the product T and the product T are synthesized at a desired ratio by arbitrarily adjusting the coefficients A and B. The ECU thus can change the allocation of the reflecting extent of the respective intention in the steering power P and hence the active operation and the passive operation can be appropriately determined according to the situation and the driving support can be changed.

It is to be noted that the ECU may further calculate the steering power P by applying the law of Stephens with respect to the above equation 2 . In this case for example the ECU may apply k1 k2 T instead of T of the above equation 2 . Similarly for example the ECU may apply k3 k4 T instead of T of the above equation 2 . k1 k2 k3 k4 a1 a2 a3 and a4 are coefficients and are compatible values that can be appropriately set based on various conditions actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The ECU for example thus can convert the physical amount that is nonlinear with respect to the sense of the driver to become linear whereby the steering power P can become a value that complies more with the sense of the driver and the determination and the driving support that comply more with the sense of the driver can be carried out.

The significance represented by the steering power P calculated in the above manner will be described next with reference to and . is an example of a steering characteristic diagram describing the significance represented by the steering power P based on the product T where the horizontal axis is the steering torque T and the vertical axis is the steering speed . is an example of a steering characteristic diagram describing the significance represented by the steering power P based on the product T where the horizontal axis is the steering torque differential value T and the vertical axis is the steering angle .

In an equal driver intention line L indicated with a plurality of dotted lines is a collection of operation points combination of steering speed and steering torque T representing the equal driver intention. Since the steering power P can be used as an index representing the intention of the driver the operation point representing the equal driver intention corresponds in other words to the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T in which the steering power P i.e. product T is equal. That is each equal driver intention line L is a collection of combinations of the steering speed and the steering torque T in which the steering power P becomes equal. If T P constant this can be deformed to P T and thus each equal driver intention line L becomes a rectangular hyperbola. For example an operation point A and an operation point B in are both positioned on the same equal driver intention line L. Thus the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T at the operation point A and the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T at the operation point B can be assumed as combinations where the driver is performing the steering operation with equal steering intention.

Then when for example the active operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of a region T in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . On the other hand when for example the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of regions T T and T in . More specifically if the steering operation itself is not carried out by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the steering hold operation is carried out by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the hands free operation is carried out by the driver or if the axial force does not exist at the time of jack up and the like as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in .

The relationship of each operation point and each of the regions T T T and T as illustrated in can specify the tendency in advance according to the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. Therefore the ECU can determine the intention of the driver according to the region where the operation point defined by the combination of the detected steering speed and steering torque T is positioned in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . That is the ECU can estimate and discriminate that the driver carried out the active operation when for example the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T is in the region T.

Then the power reference value ThP used in the discrimination of the active operation and the passive operation described above is set in advance based on the steering power P of when the active operation is carried out and the steering power P of when the passive operation is carried out. Here for example a first power reference value ThP is set based on the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . The first power reference value ThP is the power reference value ThP set with respect to the steering power P based on the product T . The first power reference value ThP can be set based on the equal driver intention line L positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . That is for example the equal driver intention line L or the operation point defined by the combination of the steering speed and the steering torque T positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation is specified based on the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The steering power P product T represented by the specified equal driver intention line L or operation point is then assumed as the first power reference value ThP.

Similarly in an equal driver intention line L indicated with a plurality of dotted lines is a collection of operation points combination of steering angle and torque differential value T representing the equal driver intention. The operation point representing the equal driver intention in other words corresponds to the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T where the steering power P i.e. product T is equal. That is each equal driver intention line L is a collection of combinations of the steering angle and the torque differential value T in which the steering power P becomes equal. If T P constant this can be deformed to P T and thus each equal driver intention line L becomes a rectangular hyperbola.

Then when for example the active operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of a region T in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . On the other hand when for example the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of regions T T and T in . More specifically if the steering operation itself is not carried out by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the steering hold operation is carried out with respect to the disturbance by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the steering hold operation is carried out at the time of turning by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in .

The relationship of each operation point and each of the regions T T T and T as illustrated in can specify the tendency in advance according to the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. Therefore the ECU can determine the intention of the driver according to the region where the operation point defined by the combination of the detected steering angle and torque differential value T is positioned in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in .

Then here for example a second power reference value ThP is set based on the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . The second power reference value ThP is the power reference value ThP set with respect to the steering power P based on the product T . The second power reference value ThP can be set based on the equal driver intention line L positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . That is for example the equal driver intention line L or the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the torque differential value T positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation is specified based on the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The steering power P product T represented by the specified equal driver intention line L or operation point is then assumed as the second power reference value ThP.

It is to be noted that the power reference value ThP may be set similar to the above even when the steering power P in which the product T and the product T are synthesized at a desired ratio is calculated using the above equation 2 and the like and the active operation and the passive operation are determined.

The ECU for example then detects the active operation when the steering power P is greater than or equal to the power reference value ThP and detects the passive operation when the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP based on the power reference value ThP set as described above and the steering power P calculated using the equation 2 and the like. The ECU then changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case of the active operation and the case of the passive operation. In other words the ECU changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device steering device between the case in which the steering power P is greater than or equal to the power reference value ThP and the case in which the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP. For example when individually calculating the steering power P based on the product T and the steering power P based on the product T to determine the intention of the driver and to change the content of the driving support the ECU may use respectively the first power reference value ThP and the second power reference value ThP described above as the power reference value ThP.

The magnitude of the steering power P also represents the strength of the intention of the driver the intention of the active operation the intention of the passive operation . Therefore the ECU may reflect the magnitude of the calculated steering power P in the content of the driving support. That is the ECU may change the control amount assist torque motor supply current etc. of the EPS device steering actuator of the steering device configuring the supporting device based on the steering power P. Thus the ECU can reflect the strength of the intention of the driver detected through the steering power P in the driving support and can compensate the strength of the intention of the driver to carry out the driving support corresponding to the strength of the intention of the driver.

The extraction of the active operation and the passive operation using the steering work amount W will be more specifically described next.

In this case the ECU calculates the steering work amount W based on the product T of the steering angle and the steering torque T determines the intention of the driver on the basis thereof and reflects the same on the driving support by the supporting device steering device . The ECU can calculate the steering work amount W using the following equation 3 for example. 3 

It is to be noted that the ECU may further calculate the steering work amount W by applying the law of Stephens with respect to the above equation 3 . In this case the ECU may apply k5 k6 T instead of T of the above equation 3 . k5 k6 a5 and a6 are coefficients and are compatible values that can be appropriately set based on various conditions actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The ECU for example thus can convert the physical amount that is nonlinear with respect to the sense of the driver to become linear whereby the steering work amount W can become a value that complies more with the sense of the driver and the determination and the driving support that comply more with the sense of the driver can be carried out.

The significance represented by the steering work amount W calculated in the above manner will be described next with reference to . is an example of a steering characteristic diagram describing the significance represented by the steering work amount W based on the product T where the horizontal axis is the steering torque T and the vertical axis is the steering angle .

In an equal driver intention line L indicated with a plurality of dotted lines is a collection of operation points combination of steering angle and steering torque T representing the equal driver intention. Since the steering work amount W can be used as an index representing the intention of the driver here the operation point representing the equal driver intention corresponds in other words to the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T in which the steering work amount W i.e. product T is equal. That is each equal driver intention line L is a collection of combinations of the steering angle and the steering torque T in which the steering work amount W becomes equal. If T W constant this can be deformed to W T and thus each equal driver intention line L becomes a rectangular hyperbola.

Then when for example the active operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of a region T in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . On the other hand when for example the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of regions T T and T in . More specifically if the steering operation itself is not carried out by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the steering hold operation e.g. in the case of vehicle deflection the steering angle is 0 and thus the intention of steering is not necessarily present is carried out by the driver as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in . If the axial force does not exist at the time of steering angle offset at the time of jack up and the like as the passive operation the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T tends to be positioned in the vicinity of the region T in .

The relationship of each operation point and each of the regions T T T and T as illustrated in can specify the tendency in advance according to the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. Therefore the ECU can determine the intention of the driver according to the region where the operation point defined by the combination of the detected steering angle and steering torque T is positioned in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in .

Then the work amount reference value ThW used in the discrimination of the active operation and the passive operation described above is set in advance based on the steering work amount W of when the active operation is carried out and the steering work amount W of when the passive operation is carried out. Here for example the work amount reference value ThW is set based on the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . The work amount reference value ThW can be set based on the equal driver intention line L positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation in the steering characteristic diagram illustrated in . That is for example the equal driver intention line L or the operation point defined by the combination of the steering angle and the steering torque T positioned at the boundary of the region of the active operation and the region of the passive operation is specified based on the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The steering work amount W product T represented by the specified equal driver intention line L or operation point is then assumed as the work amount reference value ThW.

The ECU for example then detects the active operation when the steering work amount W is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and detects the passive operation when the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW based on the work amount reference value ThW set as described above and the steering work amount W calculated using the equation 3 and the like. The ECU then changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case of the active operation and the case of the passive operation. That is the ECU changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device steering device between the case in which the steering work amount W is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and the case in which the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

The magnitude of the steering work amount W also represents the strength of the intention of the driver the intention of the active operation the intention of the passive operation . Therefore the ECU may reflect the magnitude of the calculated steering work amount W in the content of the driving support. That is the ECU may change the control amount assist torque motor supply current etc. of the EPS device steering actuator of the steering device configuring the supporting device based on the steering work amount W. Thus the ECU can reflect the strength of the intention of the driver detected through the steering work amount W in the driving support and can compensate the strength of the intention of the driver to carry out the driving support corresponding to the strength of the intention of the driver.

As described above the ECU discriminates the active operation and the passive operation of the driver based on the steering power P and the power reference value ThP as well as the steering work amount W and the work amount reference value ThW and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case of the active operation and the case of the passive operation. The ECU provides the driving support corresponding to the active operation on the steering when the steering power P is greater than or equal to the power reference value ThP and provides the driving support corresponding to the passive operation on the steering when the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP. Similarly the ECU provides the driving support corresponding to the active operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and provides the driving support corresponding to the passive operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

The ECU of the present embodiment is configured such that the supporting device includes the EPS device steering actuator of the steering device and thus the content of the driving support of the steering system carried out by the EPS device can be changed between the case of the active operation and the case of the passive operation.

It is to be noted that here the driving support of the steering system carried out by the EPS device includes for example an assist control a dumping control a hysteresis applying control a wheel returning control and the like. Such controls are carried out by adjusting the torque generated by the EPS device . As described above the assist control is a control in which an assist force that aids the steering operation on the steering by the driver is generated by the EPS device . The dumping control is a control in which a dumping force that simulates the attenuation corresponding to the viscosity property of the steering device is generated by the EPS device . In the steering device the dumping force that acts in the direction of suppressing the steering speed of the steering is imparted by the dumping control so that the steering speed of the steering tends to be suppressed and ensuring of astringency and the feedback at the time of steering can be imparted. The hysteresis applying control is a control in which a frictional force frictional torque that simulates the elastic friction corresponding to the friction property of the steering device is imparted by the EPS device to impart and compensate the friction of the steering system in a controlled manner. In the steering device the steering tends to less likely to be returned as the frictional force is imparted by the hysteresis applying control. The wheel returning control is a control in which a wheel returning force wheel returning torque in the direction of the neutral position of the steering is imparted by the EPS device to smoothly return the steering to the neutral position side and moreover a control of aiding a turn back operation toward the neutral position side of the steering .

By way of example when the steering power P is greater than or equal to the power reference value ThP the ECU reduces the degree of the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering compared to when the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP to change the content of the driving support. That is the ECU typically reduces the degree of the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering in the case of the active operation compared to the case of the passive operation. The driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering includes for example the dumping control the hysteresis applying control the wheel returning control and the like. Here by way of example the ECU reduces the dumping force generated by the EPS device in the dumping control when the steering power P is greater than or equal to the power reference value ThP compared to when the steering power P is smaller than the power reference value ThP that is in the case of the active operation compared to the case of the passive operation.

It is to be noted that in addition to changing the content of the driving support as described above the ECU may further carry out the driving support of aiding the steering operation on the steering positively not only at the time of the active operation but also at the time of the passive operation. The driving support of aiding the steering operation on the steering includes for example the assist control and the like. It is to be noted that if the supporting device includes a variable gear ratio steering mechanism VGRS device capable of changing the gear ratio of the steering a rear wheel steering device ARS Active Rear Steering device capable of steering the rear wheel of the vehicle and the like as the steering actuator the driving support of aiding the steering operation on the steering may also include a control in the variable gear ratio steering mechanism the rear wheel steering device and the like.

The driving support reflecting the determination of the active operation and the passive operation will be described below with reference to and using a case of performing the assist control and the dumping control as the driving support of the steering system by way of example.

The assist control unit calculates a basic assist control amount in the assist control. The assist control unit receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to a vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed sensor . The assist control unit computes a target assist torque corresponding to the assist force that becomes the basis as the basic assist control amount through various methods based on the input detection signals. The assist control unit outputs a current command value signal corresponding to the computed basic assist control amount to the adder .

The dumping control unit calculates a dumping control amount in the dumping control. The dumping control unit receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering speed based on the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to the vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed sensor . The dumping control unit computes the torque corresponding to a target dumping force as the dumping control amount through various methods based on the input detection signals. The dumping control unit outputs a current command value signal corresponding to the computed dumping control amount to the adder .

The adder receives the current command value signal corresponding to the basic assist control amount from the assist control unit and receives the current command value signal corresponding to the dumping control amount from the dumping control unit . The adder computes a target steering control amount final target torque in which the basic assist control amount and the dumping control amount are added based on the input current command value signals. The adder outputs the current command value signal corresponding to the computed target steering control amount to the EPS device as an EPS assist command and controls the motor of the EPS device . The ECU thereby realizes the assist control and the dumping control as described above. This becomes the basic control.

The differential computing unit computes the torque differential value T of the steering torque T. The differential computing unit receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor . The differential computing unit computes the torque differential value T of the steering torque T based on the input detection signal and outputs a computation signal corresponding to the torque differential value T to the index computing unit .

The index computing unit computes an index for the determination of the active operation and the passive operation. The index computing unit of the present embodiment is configured to include a first power computation portion that computes the steering power P based on the product T a second power computation portion that computes a steering power P based on the product T and a work amount computation portion that computes the steering work amount W based on the product T as the index. It is to be noted that the index computing unit is not limited thereto and may be configured to include any of the first power computation portion the second power computation portion and the work amount computation portion or may be configured to include a computation portion that computes the steering power P in which the product T and the product T are synthesized.

The first power computation portion receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering speed based on the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor . The first power computation portion computes the steering power P by computing a product of a steering speed t in the current control period and a steering torque T t in the current control period based on the input detection signals. The first power computation portion outputs a computation signal corresponding to the computed steering power P to the active operation determining unit .

The second power computation portion receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and receives a computation signal corresponding to the torque differential value T from the differential computing unit . The second power computation portion computes the steering power P by computing a product of a steering angle t in the current control period and a torque differential value T t in the current control period based on the input detection signals and the computation signals. The second power computation portion outputs a computation signal corresponding to the computed steering power P to the active operation determining unit .

The work amount computation portion receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor . The work amount computation portion computes the steering work amount W by computing a product of the steering angle t and the steering torque T t in the current control period based on the input detection signals. The work amount computation portion outputs a computation signal corresponding to the computed steering work amount W to the active operation determining unit .

The active operation determining unit discriminates the active operation of the driver. The active operation determining unit receives the computation signal corresponding to the steering power P from the first power computation portion receives the computation signal corresponding to the steering power P from the second power computation portion and receives the computation signal corresponding to the steering work amount W from the work amount computation portion . The active operation determining unit determines whether or not the active operation is carried out by the driver based on the input computation signals and the first power reference value ThP the second power reference value ThP and the work amount reference value ThW set in advance as described above.

Here the active operation determining unit determines that the active operation is carried out by the driver when determining that a period satisfying one or more of the following conditions 1 to 3 has continued for a predetermined period A set in advance. On the other hand the active operation determining unit determines that the passive operation is carried out by the driver when determining that the period satisfying one or more of the following conditions 1 to 3 is shorter than the predetermined period A or when determining that none of the following conditions 1 to 3 is satisfied. Then the active operation determining unit outputs a determination signal corresponding to the determination result to the driving support changing unit . It is to be noted that the predetermined period A for example may be set in advance as a period capable of reliably discriminating the active operation and the passive operation.

It is to be noted that the active operation determining unit has been described here as determining that the active operation is carried out by the driver when determining that the period satisfying one or more of the above conditions 1 to 3 has continued for the predetermined period A set in advance but is not limited thereto. The active operation determining unit may determine that the active operation is carried out by the driver when determining that the period satisfying all of the above conditions 1 to 3 has continued for the predetermined period A.

The driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device according to the determination result of the active operation and the passive operation. The driving support changing unit receives a determination signal corresponding to the determination result on the active operation from the active operation determining unit . The driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device based on the input determination signal. The driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support of the steering system carried out by the EPS device between the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the active operation is carried out by the driver and the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the passive operation is carried out by the driver.

Here the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the active operation is carried out by the driver is typically the case of determining that the period satisfying one or more of the above conditions 1 to 3 has continued for the predetermined period A set in advance. On the other hand the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the passive operation is carried out by the driver is typically the case of determining that the period satisfying one or more of the above conditions 1 to 3 is shorter than the predetermined period A or the case of determining that none of the above conditions 1 to 3 is satisfied. That is the driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device for example between the case in which the steering power P is greater than or equal to the first power reference value ThP and the case in which the steering power P is smaller than the first power reference value ThP. The driving support changing unit also changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device for example between the case in which the steering power P is greater than or equal to the second power reference value ThP and the case in which the steering power P is smaller than the second power reference value ThP. The driving support changing unit also changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device for example between the case in which the steering work amount W is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and the case in which the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

Here when it is determined that the active operation is carried out the driving support changing unit outputs a control signal for relatively reducing the dumping force generated by the EPS device to the dumping control unit in the dumping control which is the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering compared to when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out. The driving support changing unit thus changes the content of the driving support by the dumping control and changes to the driving support of relatively reducing the degree of driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering . In this case when it is determined that the active operation is carried out the dumping control unit relatively reduces the dumping control amount to be computed that is the target dumping force compared to when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out. As a result when the active operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the drive supporting device can prevent the relevant operation from being limited by the driving support and can prevent the comfortable steering operation from being inhibited.

When it is determined that the passive operation is carried out the driving support changing unit outputs a control signal for relatively increasing the dumping force generated by the EPS device to the dumping control unit in the dumping control compared to when it is determined that the active operation is carried out. The driving support changing unit thus changes the content of the driving support by the dumping control and changes to the driving support of relatively increasing the degree of driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering . In this case when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out the dumping control unit relatively increases the dumping control amount to be computed that is the target dumping force compared to when it is determined that the active operation is carried out. As a result when the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the drive supporting device can appropriately cause the dumping force to act by the driving support and can facilitate the operation by the driver.

That is the driving support changing unit limits the dumping control which is the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering when the active operation is carried out and changes the content of the driving support to allow the dumping control when the passive operation is carried out. As a result the drive supporting device can realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver according to the respective cases such as when the active operation is carried out and when the passive operation is carried out.

It is to be noted that in addition to the changing of the content of the driving support the driving support changing unit may further carry out the assist control which is the driving support of positively aiding the steering operation on the steering not only at the time of the active operation but also at the time of the passive operation. In this case even when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out the driving support changing unit outputs the control signal to the assist control unit so that the assist force becomes similar to the assist force generated by the EPS device when it is determined that the active operation is carried out. The driving support changing unit thus carries out the driving support by the assist control in the passive operation as well similarly to in the active operation. In this case when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out the assist control unit computes the basic assist control amount that is the assist force to become the basis so as to be equal to when it is determined that the active operation is carried out. As a result the drive supporting device can aid the operation of the driver by the driving support and can facilitate the operation by the driver even when the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver similarly to when the active operation is carried out.

One example of the control by the ECU will be described next with reference to . Furthermore the control routine is repeated at the control period of several milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds.

The ECU first measures the steering torque T the steering speed and the steering angle based on the detection results of the steering angle sensor and the torque sensor step ST .

Next the differential computing unit of the ECU computes the torque differential value T dT dt based on the steering torque T measured in step ST step ST .

Next the index computing unit of the ECU computes the steering power P t T t the steering power P t T t and the steering work amount W t T t in the current control period based on the steering torque T the steering speed and the steering angle measured in step ST and the torque differential value T computed in step ST step ST .

Next the active operation determining unit of the ECU determines whether or not the active operation is carried out by the driver based on the steering power P the steering power P and the steering work amount W computed in step ST step ST . For example the active operation determining unit determines whether or not the active operation is carried out by the driver by determining whether or not the state of P ThP or P ThP or W ThW has continued for the predetermined period A or longer.

When it is determined that the active operation is carried out by the driver in step ST step ST Yes the driving support changing unit of the ECU changes the support content by the supporting device so as to become the driving support corresponding to the active operation on the steering . In this case the driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support for example so as to limit the dumping control which is the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering that is so as to relatively reduce the dumping force. The assist control unit and the dumping control unit of the ECU then control the EPS device in accordance therewith executes the driving support step ST terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

When it is determined that the active operation is not carried out by the driver in step ST that is when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out step ST No the driving support changing unit of the ECU changes the support content by the supporting device so as to become the driving support corresponding to the passive operation on the steering . In this case the driving support changing unit for example changes the content of the driving support so as to allow the dumping control which is the driving support of suppressing the steering operation on the steering that is so as to relatively increase the dumping force. The assist control unit and the dumping control unit of the ECU then control the EPS device in accordance therewith executes the driving support step ST terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

The drive supporting device configured as described above changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case in which a steering power corresponding to a product of a parameter associated with a steering angle and a parameter associated with a steering torque is greater than or equal to a reference value set in advance and the case in which the steering power is smaller than the reference value. Thus the drive supporting device can change the content of the driving support by the supporting device between for example the case in which the active operation is carried out by the driver and the case in which the passive operation is carried out by the driver. For example the drive supporting device provides the driving support corresponding to the active operation when the steering power is greater than or equal to the power reference value and provides the driving support corresponding to the passive operation when the steering power is smaller than the power reference value. As a result the drive supporting device can realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver according to the respective cases such as when the active operation is carried out and when the passive operation is carried out. That is the drive supporting device can determine the active operation and the passive operation in a distinguished manner based on the steering power and the like and reflect the determined operational intention of the driver in the driving support to carry out the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver.

The drive supporting device of the present embodiment can carry out the steering support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver by reflecting the determined operational intention of the driver in the driving support of the steering system. Here the drive supporting device can change the content of the driving support so as to limit the dumping control when it can be determined that the active operation is carried out and allow the dumping control when it can be determined that the passive operation is carried out. For example when the active operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the drive supporting device can prevent the relevant operation from being limited by the driving support and can prevent the comfortable steering operation by the driver from being inhibited. On the other hand when the passive operation is carried out on the steering by the driver the drive supporting device can appropriately cause the dumping force to act by the driving support and can facilitate the operation by the driver.

The drive supporting device can also extract the intention of the driver from both the steady steering operation and the transitional steering operation by the driver and reflect the same in the driving support by determining the intention of the driver using both the steering power and the steering work amount and changing the content of the driving support and hence the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is further reduced can be carried out.

The drive supporting device can also carry out the determination of the intention of the driver using both the steering power P based on the product T and the steering power P based on the product T as the steering power and change the content of the driving support to reflect the intention of the course change of the driver the intention of the reverse input correspondence of the driver and the like and can realize the control in which the sense of discomfort is small for example. At the time of the active operation and the time of the passive operation the drive supporting device is also capable of executing the compensation control corresponding to the respective time.

Here is a block diagram illustrating another example of a schematic configuration of the ECU . For example the ECU can realize the functions corresponding to the assist control unit the dumping control unit the active operation determining unit and the driving support changing unit as described above even with the configuration illustrated in . Thus the ECU can compute the steering power P in other words the steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver and reflect the same in the driving support. It is to be noted that a case of computing the steering control amount according to the steering power P based on the product T will be described here by way of example but a case of computing the steering control amount reflecting the steering power P based on the product T the steering power P in which the product T and the product T are synthesized the steering work amount W based on the product T and the like and reflecting the same in the driving support is also substantially similar. Furthermore to facilitate the description here an example of the case in which the vehicle speed is not taken into consideration in the assist control and the dumping control will be described first and then an example of the case in which the vehicle speed is taken into consideration will be described with and to be described later.

In this case the ECU receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering speed based on the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor . The ECU then uses a multiplier control maps MP MP MP and MP and adders and to compute a target steering control amount final target torque reflecting the steering power P based on the product T in other words a target steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver from the input detection signals. The ECU then outputs a current command value signal corresponding to the computed target steering control amount to the EPS device as an EPS assist command and controls the motor of the EPS device .

In the example of the target steering control amount is expressed with the following equation 4 by the operation of the adders and . Target steering control amount basic assist control amount assist correction amount dumping control amount dumping correction amount 4 

The basic assist control amount of the above equation 4 is set by the control map MP. The ECU computes the basic assist control amount from the control map MP based on the steering torque T. The control map MP is a map in which the steering torque T and the basic assist control amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in a storage unit. In the control map MP the basic assist control amount becomes large with increase in the steering torque T.

The assist correction amount of the above equation 4 is set by the control map MP. The ECU for example keeps the assist correction amount which is the correction amount of the assist force generated by the EPS device constant when an absolute value of the steering power P is smaller than or equal to a predetermined power set in advance and changes the assist correction amount with increase in the absolute value of the steering power P when the absolute value of the steering power P is greater than the predetermined power on the basis of the control map MP. Here the predetermined power may be set in advance for example according to the actual vehicle evaluation and the like. The ECU computes the product T P of the steering speed and the steering torque T via the multiplier and computes the assist correction amount from the control map MP based on the computed product T . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the assist correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the assist correction amount is constant zero here within a predetermined range a range corresponding to the predetermined power in the vicinity of the first power reference value ThP and becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T i.e. increase in the strength of intention in both cases of the positive side active operation side and the negative side passive operation side with the first power reference value ThP as the reference outside the predetermined range. In the control map MP the assist correction amount is set such that the final control amount assist force in the assist control becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T in both the active operation and the passive operation.

The dumping control amount of the above equation 4 is set by the control map MP. The ECU computes the dumping control amount from the control map MP based on the steering speed . The control map MP is a map in which the steering speed and the dumping control amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the absolute value of the dumping control amount becomes large with increase in the steering speed . In the control map MP a region on the lower side than the origin represents the dumping force acting in a direction opposite to the assist force assist torque by the assist control.

The dumping correction amount of the above equation 4 is set by the control map MP. The ECU for example keeps the dumping correction amount which is the correction amount of the dumping force generated by the EPS device constant when an absolute value of the steering power P is smaller than or equal to a predetermined power set in advance and changes the dumping correction amount with increase in the absolute value of the steering power P when the absolute value of the steering power P is greater than the predetermined power on the basis of the control map MP. Here the predetermined power may be set in advance for example according to the actual vehicle evaluation and the like similarly to the above. The ECU computes the dumping correction amount from the control map MP based on the product T computed via the multiplier . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the dumping correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the dumping correction amount is constant zero here within a predetermined range a range corresponding to the predetermined power in the vicinity of the first power reference value ThP and is set such that the sign is interchanged between the positive side active operation side and the negative side passive operation side and becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T i.e. increase in the strength of intention with the first power reference value ThP as the reference outside the predetermined range. In the control map MP the dumping correction amount is set such that the final control amount dumping force in the dumping control becomes small with increase in the absolute value of the product T in the active operation and is set such that the final control amount dumping force in the dumping control becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T in the passive operation.

As a result the ECU can relatively reduce dumping DOWN the dumping force generated by the EPS device in the dumping control when it can be determined that the active operation is carried out i.e. P ThP as described above. On the other hand the ECU can relatively increase dumping UP the dumping force generated by the EPS device in the dumping control when it can be determined that the passive operation is carried out i.e. P

As described above the ECU can also relatively increase assist UP the assist force generated by the EPS device in the assist control according to the strength of the intention in both the case in which it can be determined that the active operation is carried out i.e. P ThP and the case in which it can be determined that the passive operation is carried out i.e. P

Other schematic configurations of the ECU of when the vehicle speed is taken into consideration in the assist control and the dumping control will be described next with reference to the block diagrams of and . For example even with the configuration illustrated in and the ECU can realize the functions corresponding to the assist control unit the dumping control unit the active operation determining unit and the driving support changing unit described above. It is to be noted that a case of computing the steering control amount according to the steering power P based on the product T will be described here again by way of example. Furthermore the case of the active operation illustrated in and the case of the passive operation illustrated in will be separately described here to facilitate the description. In and the configurations common to are denoted by the common reference numerals and also the description thereof will be omitted as much as possible.

In this case the ECU receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering speed based on the steering angle from the steering angle sensor receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to the vehicle speed V from the vehicle speed sensor . Then when it can be determined that the active operation is carried out that is when the steering power P based on the product T is greater than or equal to the first power reference value ThP the ECU computes the target steering control amount reflecting the steering power P based on the product T in the above manner. That is the ECU uses multipliers and control maps MP MP MP MP MP MP and MP and adders and to compute the target steering control amount from the input detection signals. The ECU thus can change the control amount of the EPS device based on the steering power P and the vehicle speed of the vehicle .

In the steering system such as the steering device supporting device mounted on the vehicle the steering torque tends to become relatively large when the steering is carried out at a relatively fast steering speed by the driver for example and as a result there is a risk that the steering may become difficult to carry out due to the steering system inertia the influence of the vehicle and the like. On the other hand at the time of emergency such as avoiding an obstacle there is also a demand to quickly avoid the obstacle at a relatively fast steering speed.

Here by way of example the ECU computes the target steering control amount so that the assist force by the EPS device becomes relatively large as the intention of the active operation by the driver becomes relatively strong that is the steering power P based on the product T is greater than or equal to the first power reference value ThP and the absolute value of the steering power P becomes relatively large. The drive supporting device thus can compute the steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver and reflect the same in the driving support and can carry out the driving support so that the vehicle can easily move following the intention of the driver.

In the example of the target steering control amount is expressed with the following equation 5 by the operations of the multipliers and and the adders and . Target steering control amount basic assist control amount assist correction amount first gain 1 dumping control amount second gain dumping correction amount third gain 1 5 

The assist correction amount of the above equation 5 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the assist correction amount from the control map MP based on the product T computed via the multiplier . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the assist correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the assist correction amount becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T i.e. increase in the strength of the intention in the positive side active operation side . That is in the control map MP the assist correction amount is set such that the final control amount assist force in the assist control becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T that is with increase in the strength of the active operational intention in the active operation. In the control map MP however the assist correction amount becomes zero when the absolute value of the product T is smaller than a predetermined value set in advance.

The first gain of the above equation 5 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the first gain from the control map MP based on the vehicle speed V. The control map MP is a map in which the vehicle speed V and the first gain are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the first gain becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed V. That is for example the scene where the emergency operation as described above is required is a scene where the vehicle speed is increased to a certain extent and hence in the control map MP the first gain is set so that the final control amount assist force in the assist control becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed. It is to be noted that in the control map MP the first gain becomes zero when the vehicle speed V is lower than a first predetermined vehicle speed a first predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant when the vehicle speed V is higher than a second predetermined vehicle speed a second predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance.

The second gain of the above equation 5 is set by the control map MP. The ECU computes the second gain from the control map MP based on the vehicle speed V. The control map MP is a map in which the vehicle speed V and the second gain are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the second gain once becomes small with increase in the vehicle speed V and after becoming constant gradually increases from the predetermined vehicle speed set in advance.

The dumping correction amount of the above equation 5 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the dumping correction amount from the control map MP based on the product T computed via the multiplier . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the dumping correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the dumping correction amount is set so that the final control amount dumping force in the dumping control becomes small to increase the final assist amount by the EPS device with increase in the absolute value of the product T that is increase in the strength of the active operational intention in the active operation positive side . It is to be noted that in the control map MP the dumping correction amount becomes zero when the absolute value of the product T is lower than a first predetermined value a first predetermined value in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant when the absolute value of the product T is higher than a second predetermined value a first predetermined value in the control map MP set in advance.

The third gain of the above equation 5 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the third gain from the control map MP based on the vehicle speed V. The control map MP is a map in which the vehicle speed V and the third gain are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the third gain becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed V. It is to be noted that in the control map MP the third gain becomes zero when the vehicle speed V is lower than a first predetermined vehicle speed a first predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant when the vehicle speed V is higher than a second predetermined vehicle speed a second predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance.

As a result the ECU can carry out the driving support so that the vehicle can easily move following the intention of the driver for example when it is desired to at the time of emergency such as avoiding an obstacle quickly avoid the obstacle at a relatively fast steering speed as described above. That is the ECU can set the target steering control amount so that the assist force by the EPS device becomes relatively large as the intention of the active operation by the driver becomes relatively strong in other words the steering power P based on the product T is greater than or equal to the first power reference value ThP and the steering power P becomes relatively large. Therefore the drive supporting device can compute the steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver and reflect the same in the driving support and can carry out the driving support so that the vehicle can easily move following the intention of the driver.

The ECU also computes the target steering control amount final target torque reflecting the steering power P based on the product T in the following manner when it can be determined that the passive operation is carried out that is when the steering power P based on the product T is smaller than the first power reference value ThP. That is the ECU uses the multipliers and control maps MP MP MP MP MP MP and MP and the adder as illustrated in to compute the target steering control amount from the input detection signals. The ECU thus can change the control amount of the EPS device based on the steering power P and the vehicle speed of the vehicle .

In the steering system such as the steering device supporting device mounted on the vehicle for example the burden of the driver tends to become relatively large in a situation where the steering rapidly returns against the intention of the driver and power is used for its adjustment. The increase in the burden of the driver tends to become significant when the vehicle speed of the vehicle is relatively high or when the number of passengers on the vehicle is relatively large for example.

Here by way of example the ECU computes the target steering control amount so that the assist force by the EPS device becomes relatively large as the intention of the passive operation by the driver becomes relatively strong that is the steering power P based on the product T is smaller than the first power reference value ThP and the absolute value of the steering power P becomes relatively large. Thus the drive supporting device can compute the steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver and reflect the same in the driving support and can carry out the driving support so that the steering speed does not become too large and the burden of the driver is alleviated in the above cases.

In the example of the target steering control amount is expressed with the following equation 6 by the operations of the multipliers and and the adder . Target steering control amount basic assist control amount assist correction amount fourth gain dumping control amount second gain dumping correction amount fifth gain 6 

The assist correction amount of the above equation 6 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the assist correction amount from the control map MP based on the product T computed via the multiplier . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the assist correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the assist correction amount becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T i.e. increase in the strength of the intention in the negative side passive operation side . That is in the control map MP the assist correction amount is set such that the final control amount assist force in the assist control becomes large with increase in the absolute value of the product T that is with increase in the strength of the passive operational intention in the passive operation. In the control map MP however the assist correction amount becomes zero when the absolute value of the product T is smaller than a predetermined value.

The fourth gain of the above equation 6 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the fourth gain from the control map MP based on the vehicle speed V. The control map MP is a map in which the vehicle speed V and the fourth gain are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the fourth gain becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed V. In the control map MP the fourth gain does not become zero but becomes constant at a relatively small value even when the vehicle speed V is lower than a first predetermined vehicle speed a first predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant at a relatively high value when the vehicle speed V is higher than a second predetermined vehicle speed a second predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance. For example a scene where the adjustment in the returning of the steering becomes a burden as described above is when the vehicle speed is increased to a certain extent but the steering is sometimes returned at a relatively fast speed by the torsion of the tire and the like even in the stopped state of the vehicle and there is a risk that the burden may become large. Thus in the control map MP the fourth gain is set so that the final control amount assist force in the assist control becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed and is set so that the assist force of a predetermined magnitude is output even when the vehicle speed V is around zero.

The dumping correction amount of the above equation 6 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the dumping correction amount from the control map MP based on the product T computed via the multiplier . The control map MP is a map in which the product T and the dumping correction amount are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the dumping correction amount is set so that the final control amount dumping force in the dumping control becomes large to prevent the steering speed from becoming large with increase in the absolute value of the product T that is increase in the strength of the passive operational intention in the passive operation negative side . It is to be noted that in the control map MP the dumping correction amount becomes zero when the absolute value of the product T is lower than a first predetermined value a first predetermined value in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant when the absolute value of the product T is higher than a second predetermined value a second predetermined value in the control map MP set in advance.

The fifth gain of the above equation 6 is set by the control map MP . The ECU computes the fifth gain from the control map MP based on the vehicle speed V. The control map MP is a map in which the vehicle speed V and the fifth gain are corresponded to each other and is stored in advance in the storage unit. In the control map MP the fifth gain becomes large with increase in the vehicle speed V. In the control map MP the fifth gain does not become zero but becomes constant at a relatively small value even when the vehicle speed V is lower than a first predetermined vehicle speed a first predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance and becomes constant at a relatively high value when the vehicle speed V is higher than a second predetermined vehicle speed a second predetermined vehicle speed in the control map MP set in advance similarly to the fourth gain.

As a result the ECU can prevent the burden of the driver from becoming relatively large in a situation where the steering rapidly returns against the intention of the driver and power is used for its adjustment for example as described above. That is the ECU can set the target steering control amount so that the assist force by the EPS device becomes relatively large as the intention of the passive operation by the driver becomes relatively strong in other words the steering power P based on the product T is smaller than the first power reference value ThP and the absolute value of the steering power P becomes relatively large. Therefore the drive supporting device can compute the steering control amount reflecting the intention of the driver and reflect the same in the driving support and can carry out the driving support so that the steering speed does not become too high and the burden of the driver can be alleviated in the above cases.

The drive supporting device according to the embodiment described above includes the supporting device mounted on the vehicle and capable of executing the driving support in the vehicle the steering angle sensor that detects a steering angle of the steering of the vehicle the torque sensor that detects a torque acting on the shaft that rotates with the steering and the ECU controller that controls the supporting device . The ECU changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case in which a steering power steering power P P etc. corresponding to a product of a parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and a parameter associated with the torque detected by the torque sensor is greater than or equal to a reference value first power reference value ThP second power reference value ThP etc. set in advance and the case in which the steering power is smaller than the reference value.

Furthermore the drive supporting device serving as the operation detecting device according to the embodiment described above includes the steering angle sensor that detects a steering angle of the steering of the vehicle the torque sensor that detects a torque acting on the shaft that rotates with the steering and the ECU determining device that determines the active operation on the steering and the passive operation on the steering based on a parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and a parameter associated with the torque detected by the torque sensor .

Therefore the drive supporting device the ECU can determine the intention of the driver based on the steering power and realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver and for example can carry out the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver.

It is to be noted that in the description made above the ECU has been described to calculate the steering work amount W based on the product of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor but is not limited thereto. For example the ECU may calculate the steering work amount W using a yaw rate YR of the vehicle corresponding to the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the yaw rate sensor instead of the steering angle . The yaw rate YR of the vehicle tends to become a value corresponding to the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and has a relationship of increasing with increase in the steering angle . That is the yaw rate YR of the vehicle and the steering angle are basically in a proportional relationship.

In this case for example the ECU converts the yaw rate YR of the vehicle detected by the yaw rate sensor to the steering angle based on the vehicle model of the vehicle set in advance note that in the following description the steering angle calculated from the yaw rate YR is sometimes referred to as fYR . The ECU may then calculate the steering work amount W based on a product fYR T of the steering angle fYR calculated from the yaw rate YR and the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor . That is in this case the steering work amount W is calculated based on the product fYR T of the steering angle fYR calculated according to the yaw rate YR of the vehicle and the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor as the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the yaw rate sensor . In this case the yaw rate sensor corresponds to the steering angle detecting device.

The ECU then determines the active operation and the passive operation based on the steering work amount W corresponding to the product fYR T . The ECU detects the active operation on the steering when the steering work amount W based on the product fYR T is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and detects the passive operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

Thus when correction steering counter steering operation is carried out by the driver with respect to disturbance such as when the vehicle is travelling on a slant path a travelling path having an inclination along the travelling path width direction and when a crosswind is acting on the vehicle the drive supporting device can eliminate the influence of the correction steering and carry out the determination of the active operation and the passive operation while suppressing false determination. For example if the correction steering is carried out with respect to the disturbance by the driver there is a risk that the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor may become large and the steering work amount W based on the product T may also become large and thus there is a risk that the ECU may determine the operation as the active operation although it is the passive operation. In contrast the drive supporting device can carry out the determination using the steering work amount W based on the product fYR T to determine as the passive operation when the correction steering is being carried out with respect to the disturbance by the driver. As a result the drive supporting device can eliminate the influence of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance such as the slant path and the crosswind and appropriately realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver.

The ECU may also directly calculate the steering work amount W based on the product YR T of the yaw rate YR and the steering torque T without converting the yaw rate YR of the vehicle detected by the yaw rate sensor to the steering angle . In this case the work amount reference value ThW may be appropriately converted in correspondence with the product YR T . The ECU may then detect the active operation on the steering when the steering work amount W based on the product is greater than or equal to the work amount reference value ThW and detect the passive operation on the steering when the steering work amount W is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

A drive supporting device of the present embodiment illustrated in includes an ECU serving as both a controller and a determining device.

Hereinafter the extraction of the driver steering state caused by the change in environment using a steering power P and a steering work amount W will be described.

The ECU of the present embodiment determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance when a period in which an amplitude of the steering power P is greater than or equal to an amplitude threshold value defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to a predetermined period set in advance. Here the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is a correction operation carried out by the driver via a steering with respect to the disturbance when a vehicle is travelling on the slant path the crosswind is acting on the vehicle and the like as described above.

For example when the vehicle is travelling on the slant path as illustrated in periodic correction steering is carried out by the driver as illustrated with an arrow A and an arrow B and then tends to shift to a steady steering state as illustrated with an arrow C. In such a case a line L representing steering angle steering torque T at the time of travelling on the slant path is offset to the negative side with respect to a line L representing steering angle steering torque T at the time of travelling on a flat path as illustrated in . Furthermore as illustrated in a line L representing the steering angle and a line L representing the steering torque T at the time of travelling on the slant path along a time axis t are both offset according to the inclination of the slant path with respect to a line L representing the steering angle and the line L representing the steering torque T at the time of travelling on the flat path. For example if the steering torque T is greater than a predetermined value it can be detected that the inclination of the slant path is large disturbance is large but actually a steering speed at the time of the returning operation fluctuates by the magnitude and the like of the steering torque T and the steering torque T in the correction steering also fluctuates as a result. Thus determination of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance by the simple body of the steering torque T and the like tends to be substantially difficult as false determination may be made assuming that the correction steering is an active operation for example.

The ECU of the present embodiment thus determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance as a passive operation based on the amplitude of the steering power P so that the correction steering can be accurately determined. Here the amplitude of the steering power P can be calculated based on for example a difference peak to peak difference of a maximum value peak and a minimum value peak of the steering power P an absolute value of the maximum value of the steering power an absolute value of the minimum value of the steering power or the like.

It is to be noted that hereinafter the ECU will be described to determine the correction steering with respect to the disturbance using a steering power P based on a product T and a steering power P based on a product T but is not limited thereto. The ECU may determine the correction steering with respect to the disturbance using one of the steering power P based on the product T and the steering power P based on the product T or may determine the correction steering with respect to the disturbance using the steering power P in which the product T and the product T are synthesized.

The ECU of the present embodiment determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance when a period in which the amplitude of the steering power P is greater than or equal to an amplitude threshold value ThPA defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to a predetermined period B set in advance. The ECU also determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance when a period in which the amplitude of the steering power P is greater than or equal to an amplitude threshold value ThPA defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to the predetermined period B. It is to be noted that the amplitude threshold value ThPA and the amplitude threshold value ThPA are set to values at which the correction steering with respect to the disturbance can be determined based on the actual vehicle evaluation and the like for example. The predetermined period B may also be set in advance for example as a period in which the correction steering with respect to the disturbance can be reliably discriminated.

The ECU of the present embodiment may further determine the correction steering with respect to the disturbance using a steering work amount W calculated in view of a steering angle at the time of straight ahead travelling of the vehicle or the steering work amount W calculated in view of a steering angle fYR calculated from a yaw rate YR. In this case the steering work amount W is calculated based on a product T of a steering angle corresponding to a difference of the steering angle detected by a steering angle sensor and the steering angle at the time of straight ahead travelling of the vehicle as a parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering torque T detected by a torque sensor . Alternatively the steering work amount W may be calculated based on a product fYR T of a steering angle fYR corresponding to a difference of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering angle fYR calculated according to the yaw rate YR of the vehicle and the steering torque T detected by the torque sensor . Here the steering angle at the time of straight ahead travelling is typically a steering angle at a neutral position of the steering for example 0 . As described above the steering angle fYR is calculated from the yaw rate YR of the vehicle detected by the yaw rate sensor based on the vehicle model of the vehicle set in advance. The steering work amount W calculated in the above manner having the steering angle or the steering angle fYR as a reference corresponds to one that represents the magnitude strength of the correction steering passive operation with respect to the disturbance. It is to be noted that the product T and the product fYR T basically become negative values.

Then it is also possible that the ECU determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance as the passive operation based on the steering work amount W calculated with the steering angle or the steering angle fYR as the reference in the above manner so that the correction steering can be accurately determined. The ECU for example determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance when a period in which the negative magnitude of the steering work amount W is smaller than or equal to a predetermined work amount ThW defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to the predetermined period B. It is to be noted that the predetermined work amount ThW is set to a value at which the correction steering with respect to the disturbance can be determined based on the actual vehicle evaluation and the like for example. The predetermined period B may also be set in advance as a period in which the correction steering with respect to the disturbance can be reliably discriminated for example as described above.

The drive supporting device of the present embodiment then reflects the determination result of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance as described above in the driving support by the supporting device which is the driving support of a steering system carried out by an EPS device here. That is the ECU of the present embodiment controls the EPS device based on the determination result of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance. When the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is detected the ECU thus carries out the driving support corresponding to the correction steering with respect to the disturbance.

When it can be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out for example the ECU carries out the driving support such that at least one of an assist force a dumping force and a frictional force generated by the EPS device becomes large compared to when it cannot be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out. The drive supporting device thus can impart stability to the correction steering and can alleviate the burden of the correction steering by the driver by the driving support corresponding to the correction steering with respect to the disturbance.

It is to be noted that the case in which it can be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out is a case in which a period in which the amplitude of the steering power P P is greater than or equal to the amplitude threshold value ThPA ThPA defined in advance has continued for the predetermined period B set in advance for example. The case in which it cannot be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out is a case in which the amplitude of the steering power P P is smaller than the amplitude threshold value ThPA ThPA or a case in which a period in which the amplitude of the steering power P P is greater than or equal to the amplitude threshold value ThPA ThPA is shorter than the predetermined period B. Furthermore when the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is determined using the steering work amount W the case in which it can be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out may include a case in which a period in which the steering work amount W is smaller than or equal to the predetermined work amount ThW defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to the predetermined period B set in advance for example. Similarly the case in which it cannot be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out may include for example a case in which the steering work amount W is greater than the predetermined work amount ThW or a case in which a period in which the steering work amount W is smaller than or equal to the predetermined work amount ThW is shorter than the predetermined period B.

When it can be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out the ECU may also carry out the driving support of causing the EPS device to add an offset torque according to the magnitude of the disturbance such as the inclination of the slant path and the strength of the crosswind compared to when it cannot be determined that the correction steering is carried out. In this case as well the drive supporting device can impart stability to the correction steering and alleviate the burden of the correction steering by the driver by the driving support corresponding to the correction steering with respect to the disturbance.

Specifically as illustrated in the ECU of the present embodiment is configured to further function conceptually include a hysteresis applying control unit an index computing unit a correction steering determining unit and the like in addition to the configuration of described in the first embodiment for example. It is to be noted that in the present figure the illustration of an index computing unit an active operation determining unit a driving support changing unit and the like is omitted.

The hysteresis applying control unit calculates a hysteresis applying control amount in a hysteresis applying control. The hysteresis applying control unit receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering angle from the steering angle sensor and receives a detection signal corresponding to a vehicle speed V from a vehicle speed sensor . The hysteresis applying control unit computes a torque frictional torque corresponding to a target frictional force as the hysteresis applying control amount through various methods based on the input detection signals. The hysteresis applying control unit outputs a current command value signal corresponding to the computed hysteresis applying control amount to an adder .

In this case the adder receives a current command value signal corresponding to a basic assist control amount from an assist control unit receives a current command value signal corresponding to a dumping control amount from a dumping control unit and receives the current command value signal corresponding to the hysteresis applying control amount from the hysteresis applying control unit . The adder computes a target steering control amount final target torque in which the basic assist control amount the dumping control amount and the hysteresis applying control amount are added based on the input current command value signals. The adder outputs the current command value signal corresponding to the computed target steering control amount to the EPS device as the EPS assist command and controls the motor of the EPS device . The ECU thereby realizes the assist control the dumping control and the hysteresis applying control described above. This becomes the basic control.

The index computing unit computes an index for the determination of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance. The index computing unit of the present embodiment is configured to include a first power computation portion that computes the steering power P based on the product T a second power computation portion that computes the steering power P based on the product T and a work amount computation portion that computes the steering work amount W based on the product fYR T as the index. The first power computation portion and the second power computation portion of the index computing unit described above are used for the first power computation portion and the second power computation portion here. It is to be noted that the index computing unit may be configured to include a work amount computation portion that computes the steering work amount W based on the product T in place of the work amount computation portion that computes the steering work amount W based on the product fYR T .

The work amount computation portion receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering angle from the steering angle sensor receives a detection signal corresponding to the steering torque T from the torque sensor and receives the yaw rate YR of the vehicle from the yaw rate sensor . The work amount computation portion computes a steering angle fYR t from a yaw rate YR t in the current control period based on the input detection signals and computes a difference of the fYR t and a steering angle t in the current control period. The work amount computation portion then computes the steering work amount W by computing a product of the difference fYR t t and a steering torque T t . The work amount computation portion outputs a computation signal corresponding to the computed steering work amount W to the correction steering determining unit .

The correction steering determining unit discriminates the correction steering with respect to the disturbance by the driver. The correction steering determining unit receives a computation signal corresponding to the steering power P from the first power computation portion receives a computation signal corresponding to the steering power P from the second power computation portion and receives the computation signal corresponding to the steering work amount W from the work amount computation portion . The correction steering determining unit determines whether or not the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver based on the input computation signals and the amplitude threshold value ThPA the amplitude threshold value ThPA and the predetermined work amount ThW set in advance as described above.

Here the correction steering determining unit determines that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver when determining that a period satisfying one or more of the following conditions 4 to 6 has continued for a predetermined period B set in advance. On the other hand the correction steering determining unit determines that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is not carried out when determining that the period satisfying one or more of the following conditions 4 to 6 is shorter than the predetermined period B or when determining that none of the following conditions 4 to 6 is satisfied. The correction steering determining unit then outputs a control signal corresponding to the determination result to the assist control unit the dumping control unit and the hysteresis applying control unit .

It is to be noted that the correction steering determining unit has been described here to determine that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver when determining that the period satisfying one or more of the above conditions 4 to 6 has continued for the predetermined period B set in advance but is not limited thereto. The correction steering determining unit may determine that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver when determining that the period satisfying all of the above conditions 4 to 6 has continued for the predetermined period B.

When determining that the correction steering is carried out for example the correction steering determining unit increases the assist force and the dumping force generated by the EPS device compared to when determining that the correction steering is not carried out and also outputs a switching signal of a control map and the like for increasing a control gain in the hysteresis applying control to the assist control unit the dumping control unit and the hysteresis applying control unit .

The ECU first measures the steering torque T the steering speed the steering angle and the yaw rate YR based on the detection results of the steering angle sensor the torque sensor and the yaw rate sensor step ST .

Next a differential computing unit of the ECU computes a torque differential value T dT dt based on the steering torque T measured in step ST step ST .

Next the index computing unit of the ECU computes the steering power P t T t the steering power P t T t and the steering work amount W fYR t t T t in the current control period based on the steering torque T the steering speed the steering angle and the yaw rate YR measured in step ST and the torque differential value T computed in step ST step ST .

Next the correction steering determining unit of the ECU determines whether or not the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver based on the steering power P the steering power P and the steering work amount W computed in step ST step ST . For example the correction steering determining unit determines whether or not the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver by determining whether or not a state of PA ThPA or PA ThPA or W ThW has continued for the predetermined period B or longer.

The correction steering determining unit of the ECU carries out the following processing when determining that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out by the driver in step ST step ST Yes . That is the correction steering determining unit increases the assist force and the dumping force generated by the EPS device and also outputs a switching signal of a compensation control map and the like for increasing the control gain in the hysteresis applying control to the assist control unit the dumping control unit and the hysteresis applying control unit step ST terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

When it is determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is not carried out by the driver in step ST step ST No the driving support changing unit of the ECU terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

The drive supporting device configured as described above can accurately determine the correction steering with respect to the disturbance by determining the correction steering with respect to the disturbance based on the amplitudes of the steering powers P and P and the steering work amount W . For example when the vehicle is travelling on the slant path as illustrated in the steering power P the steering power P and the steering work amount W fluctuate as illustrated in . That is a line L representing the steering power P and a line L representing the steering power P at the time of travelling on the slant path along a time axis t both tend to have the amplitude that becomes relatively large according to the periodic correction steering for corresponding to the disturbance with respect to a line L representing the steering power P and a line L representing the steering power P at the time of travelling on the flat path. In other words when a state in which the steering powers P and P are fluctuating as indicated with the lines L and L has continued for a predetermined period it can be estimated that the periodic correction steering is carried out by the driver in correspondence with a situation where some kind of disturbance is occurring and that there is a state in which the active operation and the passive operation are frequently repeated. Furthermore a line L representing the steering work amount W at the time of travelling on the slant path along the time axis t becomes in a state offset to the negative side according to the strength of the disturbance with respect to a line L representing the steering work amount W at the time of travelling on the flat path. The drive supporting device can appropriately and accurately determine the correction steering which is one type of passive operation by the driver by using the above fact and carrying out the determination using the conditions 4 to 6 described above.

The drive supporting device then reflects the determination result of the correction steering with respect to the disturbance as described above in the driving support by the supporting device here the driving support of the steering system carried out by the EPS device . The drive supporting device thus can impart stability to the correction steering obtain a settled steering property and also alleviate the burden of the correction steering by the driver by the driving support.

The drive supporting device the ECU according to the embodiment described above can determine the intention of the driver based on the steering power and realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver and for example can carry out the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver.

According to the drive supporting device of the embodiment described above the ECU further determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance when the period in which the amplitude of the steering power is greater than or equal to the amplitude threshold value defined in advance has continued longer than or equal to a predetermined period set in advance. The steering work amount is also calculated based on the product of the steering angle corresponding to the difference of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering angle at the time of straight ahead travelling of the vehicle or the steering angle corresponding to the difference of the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering angle calculated according to the yaw rate of the vehicle as the parameter associated with the steering angle detected by the steering angle sensor and the steering torque detected by the torque sensor . The ECU then determines the correction steering with respect to the disturbance based on the steering work amount. When it can be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out the ECU increases at least one of the assist force generated by the EPS device the dumping force generated by the EPS device and the frictional force generated by the EPS device compared to when it cannot be determined that the correction steering with respect to the disturbance is carried out.

Therefore according to the drive supporting device the ECU can appropriately detect the correction steering with respect to the disturbance by the driver and can realize the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small according to the correction steering with respect to the disturbance.

A drive supporting device of the present embodiment illustrated in includes an ECU serving as both a controller and a determining device.

The drive supporting device of the present embodiment reflects the determination result of an active operation and a passive operation based on a steering power in a driving support control of a drive system of a vehicle here driving support by a so called stop start system S S system .

A supporting device of the present embodiment is configured to include an engine restart requesting unit serving as an operation unit. The engine restart requesting unit controls an engine serving as a power source that generates power for causing the vehicle to travel and carries out the S S driving support by automatically starting and stopping the engine . Here the S S driving support is the driving support of realizing enhancement in fuel economy performance by suppressing the consumption of fuel and using an inertia travelling state of the vehicle involved therewith by automatically stopping and automatically restarting the engine during the travelling of the vehicle for example.

The engine restart requesting unit automatically stops the engine by cutting the supply of fuel to a combustion chamber of the engine fuel cut thus causing the engine to be in a non operating state when an engine stop permitting condition a stop permitting condition of the engine for stopping the engine is met during the travelling of the vehicle . The engine restart requesting unit also returns from the fuel cut state to the combustion chamber and restarts the engine thus causing the engine to be in an operating state when the engine is in the non operating state during the travelling of the vehicle and for example when an engine restarting condition for restarting the engine is met. It is to be noted that the engine restart requesting unit may be used as a part of the ECU .

The ECU of the present embodiment uses the determination result of the active operation and the passive operation as the engine restarting condition by the engine restart requesting unit . The ECU controls the engine restart requesting unit configuring the supporting device based on the determination result and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device . That is the ECU controls the engine restart requesting unit based on a steering power and the like corresponding to a product of a parameter associated with a steering angle detected by a steering angle sensor and a parameter associated with a steering torque detected by a torque sensor and changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device .

The ECU of the present embodiment is configured such that the supporting device includes the engine restart requesting unit and thus the content of the driving support of the drive system carried out by the engine restart requesting unit can be changed between the case of the active operation and the case of the passive operation. Here by way of example the ECU changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device based on a steering power P based on a product T a steering power P based on a product T a steering work amount W based on a product T and the like.

The ECU controls the engine restart requesting unit to carry out the driving support of starting the engine when it can be determined that the active operation is carried out by the driver and does not carry out the driving support of starting the engine when it can be determined that the passive operation is carried out by the driver. For example the ECU carries out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering power P based on the product T is greater than or equal to a first power reference value ThP and does not carry out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering power P based on the product T is smaller than the first power reference value ThP. Furthermore for example the ECU may carry out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering power P based on the product T is greater than or equal to a second power reference value ThP and may not carry out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering power P based on the product T is smaller than the second power reference value ThP. Moreover the ECU may carry out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering work amount W based on the product T is greater than or equal to a work amount reference value ThW and may not carry out the driving support of starting the engine when the steering work amount W based on the product T is smaller than the work amount reference value ThW.

In the ECU of the present embodiment a driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support by the engine restart requesting unit according to the determination result of the active operation and the passive operation by an active operation determining unit . The driving support changing unit receives a determination signal corresponding to the determination result on the active operation from the active operation determining unit . The driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device based on the input determination signal. The driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support of S S carried out by the driving support changing unit between the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the active operation is carried out by the driver and the case in which the active operation determining unit determines that the passive operation is carried out by the driver.

Here the driving support changing unit outputs a control signal for permitting the start of the engine to the engine restart requesting unit when it is determined that the active operation is carried out. The driving support changing unit accordingly changes to the driving support of starting the engine . The engine restart requesting unit grasps the state of the engine and then starts the engine if the engine is in the stopped state when it is determined that the active operation is carried out.

On the other hand the driving support changing unit outputs a control signal for not permitting the start of the engine to the engine restart requesting unit when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out. The driving support changing unit accordingly changes to the driving support of not starting the engine . The engine restart requesting unit grasps the state of the engine and then maintains the stopped state of the engine if the engine is in the stopped state when it is determined that the passive operation is carried out.

That is the driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support so as to permit the driving support of starting the engine when the active operation is carried out and limit the driving support of starting the engine when the passive operation is carried out. As a result the drive supporting device can realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver according to the respective cases such as when the active operation is carried out and when the passive operation is carried out.

Here and are views describing the determination on the intention of the driver based on the steering torque the determination on the intention of the driver based on the steering speed and the determination on the intention of the driver based on the steering power. In and the horizontal axis is the feedback typically corresponds to a self aligning torque of a steering that changes in accordance with the road surface environment road surface and the assist situation. Furthermore the vertical axis of is the steering torque T the vertical axis of is the steering speed and the vertical axis of is the steering power P.

As illustrated in and when the intention of the driver is determined based on simply the simple body of the steering torque T or the simple body of the steering speed the steering torque T and the steering speed tend to fluctuate according to the feedback of the steering . For example when the road surface is low that is the feedback of the steering is light steering is carried out with a relatively small torque but the steering speed tends to become relatively fast. Thus in such a case the determination result of the intention of the driver active operation passive operation may be influenced by the road surface environment and the assist situation.

As illustrated in on the other hand when the intention of the driver is determined based on the steering power P and the like the steering power P is not influenced by the road surface environment the assist situation and the like and does not fluctuate according to the feedback of the steering Thus the ECU can accurately determine the intention of the driver active operation passive operation without being subjected to such influences by determining the active operation passive operation in the above manner.

One example of the control by the ECU and the engine restart requesting unit will be described next with reference to . It is to be noted that the redundant description between and will be omitted as much as possible here.

When it is determined that the active operation is carried out by the driver in step ST step ST Yes the driving support changing unit of the ECU changes the support content by the supporting device to become the driving support corresponding to the active operation on the steering . In this case the driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support so as to allow the driving support of starting the engine . The engine restart requesting unit then determines whether or not the engine is stopped step ST .

When it is determined that the engine is stopped in step ST step ST Yes the engine restart requesting unit outputs an engine restart request to the engine to actually restart the engine step ST terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

When it is determined that the engine is not stopped in step ST that is the engine is consuming the fuel and is in operation step ST No the engine restart requesting unit terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time.

When it is determined that the active operation is not carried out by the driver in step ST that is the passive operation is carried out step ST No the driving support changing unit of the ECU changes the support content by the supporting device to become the driving support corresponding to the passive operation on the steering terminates the control period of this time and proceeds to the control period of next time. In this case the driving support changing unit changes the content of the driving support so as to limit the driving support of starting the engine .

The drive supporting device configured as described above changes the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case in which a steering power corresponding to a product of a parameter associated with a steering angle and a parameter associated with a steering torque is greater than or equal to a reference value set in advance and the case in which the steering power is smaller than the reference value. Thus for example the drive supporting device can change the content of the driving support by the supporting device between the case in which the active operation is carried out by the driver and the case in which the passive operation is carried out by the driver. The drive supporting device for example provides the driving support corresponding to the active operation when the steering power is greater than or equal to the power reference value and provides the driving support corresponding to the passive operation when the steering power is smaller than the power reference value. As a result the drive supporting device can realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver according to the respective cases such as when the active operation is carried out and when the passive operation is carried out. That is the drive supporting device can determine in a distinguished manner the active operation and the passive operation reflecting the operational intention of the driver based on the steering power and the like and reflect the determined operational intention of the driver in the driving support to carry out the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver.

The drive supporting device of the present embodiment can carry out the engine start support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver by reflecting the determined operational intention of the driver in the S S driving support of the drive system. Here when it can be determined that the active operation is carried out the drive supporting device can carry out the drive support of simulating the active intention of the driver to start the engine with the active operation by the driver and automatically starting the engine . As a result the drive supporting device can realize the engine start following the operational intention of the driver.

The drive supporting device the ECU according to the embodiment described above can determine the intention of the driver based on the steering power realize the driving support reflecting the intention of the driver and for example carry out the driving support in which the sense of discomfort is small for the driver.
