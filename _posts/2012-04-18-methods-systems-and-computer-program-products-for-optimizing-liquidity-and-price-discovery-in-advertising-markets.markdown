This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 579 796 filed Dec. 23 2011 entitled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Optimizing Liquidity and Price Discovery in Advertising Markets which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 281 020 filed Oct. 25 2011 entitled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Managing Organized Binary Advertising Asset Markets which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 162 179 filed Jun. 16 2011 entitled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Managing Organized Binary Advertising Asset Markets which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 398 259 filed Jun. 23 2010 entitled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Managing Organized Profile Based Markets all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.

This disclosure relates to the field of structured financial instruments and more particularly to improved methods systems and computer program products for optimized liquidity and price discovery of audience profile access rights in association with an organized binary advertising asset market for structured advertising assets.

The increasing sophistication and complexity of media markets and of the advertising trading techniques used by participants in these markets has led to growing interest in a variety of types of advertising and content placed in direct markets including the Internet and elsewhere around individual user behavior and interest. Many believe micro markets are in need of an efficient advertising placement mechanism that allows for economically viable placements targeted to small well defined groups of potential customers.

One of the primary differences of an electronic market exchange system for structured advertising assets specifically audience profile access rights is the myriad of ways in which the profile of a single individual or group of individuals may be described such that advertisers find that profile to be of value. Existing market structures currently support a single listing for each asset as nearly all markets today are built on the assumption that nearly all market participants will value the underlying asset in such a way that little variation exists in the distribution of bids and offers. Further deficiencies in existing ad market structures are clear when the complexity of multiple asset valuations within the market are exhibited in a consumption based primary market where buyers may consume the purchased assets and sellers are subject to asset expiration without value.

Accordingly what is desired are techniques for improving price discovery and depth of market for structured advertising assets.

Aspects of the present invention relate to improved systems methods and computer program products for optimizing the sale pricing of audience profile access rights. This includes the ability to provide a pricing request associated with a single asset that may be represented by multiple listing symbols receiving one or more orders for each listing symbol the available volume represented in the limit order book of each listing symbol selecting an order from the one or more orders with consideration of available volume associated prices and applying the process to a portfolio of assets wherein an optimized asset pricing across the portfolio is presented to the seller in association with the request to optimize the pricing of a single or multiple asset order in a form which includes but is not limited to a list of symbols and associated transaction size and price.

Unique to a market for structured advertising products is the ability to list single assets for sale under multiple listing symbols in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The ability to list a portfolio of single assets represented by a plurality of listing symbols enables sellers and buyers to maximize revenue generated by the sale of the assets or minimize the expense generated by the purchase of the assets respectively. In the improved systems methods and computer program products a seller of the structured advertising assets which comprise but are not limited to audience profile access rights requests the listing symbol or symbols which would represent the optimal price for the possible sale of an asset or portfolio of assets. In a variation a buyer is provided with the optimal listing symbol or symbols for the purchase of an asset or portfolio of assets.

The exemplary embodiments consist of major and subsidiary components implemented through a variety of separate and related computer systems. These components may be used either individually or in variety of combinations to achieve the objective of providing a new and improved way to enable content providers to price their specified target audience for purchase or sale anytime based on real time demand or otherwise and anywhere without limitation of device platform or an association with content that may limit the distribution of that content. Further the disclosed embodiments provide for commercialization of price optimization mechanisms within organized electronic marketplaces where rights to access audience profiles and or display space can be traded in a primary or secondary market.

Additionally one skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that the techniques discussed herein with relation to structured advertising assets may be applicable to other types of assets and such flexibility of the marketplace described herein is contemplated within the scope and spirit of this disclosure.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 281 020 filed Oct. 25 2011 entitled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Managing Organized Binary Advertising Asset Markets which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety provides a market in which an Audience Producer an entity capable of delivering audience profile access rights and or display space access rights e.g. a web site owner cable operator newspaper publisher etc. can sell audience profile access rights and or display space access rights as separate assets to an Audience Consumer e.g. advertiser by way of non limiting example. This functionality on its own provides improved ways to connect Audience Producers with Audience Consumers to buy and sell these structured advertising assets with better information and better ability to price the assets at their expected value.

Much work continues to be done to improve on this innovation. One such improvement described herein is the ability to optimize the liquidity that an Audience Producer can access for the sale of audience profile access rights where each individual audience profile access right is listed using the listing symbology that can garner the highest price discovery and depth of market in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As described below a novel symbology selection process and a novel symbology assignment process is utilized to provide detailed and accurate symbols for the structured advertising assets.

The information provided by the aforementioned symbology processes is utilized in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention by providing an exchange environment with the ability to list a single asset for sale under multiple listing symbols to improve liquidity for transacting parties. In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention a process is provided for identifying multiple listing symbols for a single structured advertising asset where the single structured advertising asset is offered for sale using multiple listing symbols simultaneously. In accordance with an additional embodiment of the present invention the single structured advertising asset offered for sale using multiple listing symbols is assigned a single unique identifying symbol.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention use of a single order or multiple orders with multiple symbols using an order cancels order process is provided to facilitate liquidity when multiple listing symbols are used where said assets are managed separately or in a synthetic process. This allows sell orders associated with multiple listing symbols to be cancelled when a separate order is fulfilled that exhausts the underlying asset e.g. a single structured advertising asset being sold under multiple listing symbols with associated sell orders when one sell order is matched the other sell orders must be cancelled . In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention fulfillment of an order may modify outstanding sell orders e.g. reducing inventory to account for the sale of the underlying asset. Accordingly while reference is made throughout to the order cancels order process an order modification process can be utilized instead where appropriate as will be understood by one skilled in the relevant art.

In determining what assets are available for sale by an Audience Producer the market should provide Audience Consumers with some confidence about the Audience Producer s ability to perform. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention verification of assets is provided as part of a profile based market. As described in further detail below this can be accomplished through the use of third party data and analytics.

The exemplary non limiting embodiments disclosed herein meet the aforementioned needs by using novel price discovery mechanisms novel order types novel symbology selection processes novel symbology assignment processes novel order posting processes novel designations and formats and transaction processing features that permit the introduction of price discovery and unimpeded liquidity in organized exchange environments direct and alternative secondary markets in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Disclosed embodiments are designed to provide market participants with a new way to determine market price such that orders maximize access to liquidity and price discovery to a transactor e.g. Audience Producers and Audience Consumers or secondary market participants .

When specific commercial embodiments are described herein such as by reference to existing Audience Producers and Audience Consumers such descriptions are provided by way of example and not limitation. One skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that the examples provided herein can be implemented in other contexts and that sufficient disclosure is provided to enable such implementation.

Before an Audience Producer is able to sell display space access rights and audience profile access rights structured advertising assets it is important to ascertain precisely what those rights are. Inventory in display space access rights is determined in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention by considering what advertising spaces are available on media published by the Audience Producer e.g. a banner advertisement on a web page . However ascertaining the audience profile access rights is more difficult and it is not always acceptable to rely on a good faith estimate of the Audience Producer s available audience profile access rights i.e. the particular make up of the viewers of the display spaces of the corresponding display space access rights . Instead third party data and analytics can provide a clearer picture of the scope of audience profile access rights although one skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that these techniques may be applicable to other structured advertising assets.

The process begins at step where an Audience Producer wishing to sell display space access rights and audience profile access rights within the organized electronic market for structured advertising assets queries third party publisher traffic volume data e.g. analytic data to establish its future capacity to create display space opportunities and audience profile access opportunities. By way of non limiting example this functionality is initiated using the interface depicted in which is described in further detail below.

The Audience Producer provides viewer profile data at step and display space inventory data at step to the brokerage system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. If using an interface such as the interface of where the interface is provided to the Audience Producer by an entity of the organized electronic market such as the brokerage system the Audience Producer can import the viewer profile data at step directly into the organized electronic market. This information includes by way of non limiting example analytics data provided by Nielsen of New York N.Y. when the Audience Producer is a television station or cable operator or Webtrends of Portland Oreg. when the Audience Producer is a web site operator.

With the necessary data for verification of the structured advertising assets available the brokerage system then cleanses the data at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular the data from various supported external third party analytics providers e.g. Webtrends Nielsen Experian Unica Omniture etc. is reviewed to delete anomalies in the data likely to represent errors or non conforming asset structures.

Once the verification data has been imported and cleansed the data can be reviewed for approval at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. With the data approved it is possible to create and allocate assets into the Audience Producer s account with the brokerage system. The profile data and the traffic volume data are combined and the system then parses the data at step in preparation to post the assets to the publisher s account Audience Producer s account at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Parsing the data at step allows the brokerage system to account for a variety of third party analytics providers each having their own unique formats for publishing analytics data.

In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention if the inventory to be offered by the Audience Producer represents online display advertising inventory then the brokerage system checks for the validity of the display space inventory by querying the location of the display space at step . If the system finds that the descriptive display space data does not match the results of the query the system will assign an expired or error status to the display space access right and remove the inventory from the Audience Producer s account at step . When the brokerage system finds that the descriptive display space data matches what is queried or alternatively when the media is not callable e.g. offline assets although one skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that these techniques can be converted for application to other non web assets the process proceeds to step .

The inventory is processed through the symbology assignment process at step which is described in further detail below in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Once symbols have been assigned to the asset the Audience Producer instructs the brokerage system to offer its inventory for sale at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular once the Audience Producer s inventory has been verified had symbols assigned and posted to the Audience Producer s account the Audience Producer can then sell or otherwise trade on their inventory. By way of non limiting example the Audience Producer can trade their inventory utilizing the user interface illustrated in which is described in further detail below. The offer for sale is then processed through the offer posting process and the bid offer matching process each of which is described in further detail below in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

By way of non limiting example an Audience Producer that publishes television content can utilize the aforementioned process to sell audience profile access rights and display space access rights for an upcoming broadcast. Using the organized electronic market for structured advertising assets the publisher the Audience Producer uses the brokerage system to import audience ratings data provided at step or third party publisher traffic volume data from one or more data providers such as The Nielsen Company or another viewer measurement provider apparent to one skilled in the art at step .

Continuing the above example the brokerage system is configured to use the data imported at step to estimate the number of display space access rights and audience profile access rights that will be available for advertising placement during a broadcast. The Audience Producer additionally imports publishers display space inventory data at step which describes the attributes of the display space made available by the Audience Producer. The display space descriptive data and the audience profile data are then cleansed at step where anomalies in the data likely to represent errors or non conforming asset structures may be discovered and removed.

With the data cleansed the brokerage system approves the data for processing at step . The brokerage system then parses the data at step to assign individual display space attributes to a display space access right asset and audience profile attributes to an audience profile access right asset in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

For display space access rights in media that is callable such as online display mobile display or on demand video the system may subject to certain parameters automatically verify the presence and characteristic of the display space within the callable media at step . If the system finds that the descriptive display space data does not match what is queried from the callable media the system will assign an expired or error status to the access right and remove the inventory from the Audience Producer s account at step . If everything is in order the assets are provided with symbology through the symbology assignment process . The assets are then posted to the Audience Producer s publisher account at step . Once the assets are in the account the Audience Producer e.g. television publisher may offer inventory for sale at step from the assets in the account using a user interface provided by the brokerage system. With an offer to sell in place the offer is processed through the offer posting process and then the bid offer matching process to initiate the transaction as described in further detail below in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

To achieve this improvement the system determines if the publisher will use a custom symbology algorithm for the asset inventory at step . If the publisher has not selected a custom symbology algorithm the process uses a default symbology algorithm at step . In such an embodiment the Audience Producer may allow the system to use a system default algorithm may set the system to use a user defined default algorithm may have multiple pre saved algorithms which are selected based on a set of rules or may use a manual process for the definition of the appropriate symbology to use by way of non limiting example. If the brokerage system detects that the Audience Producer wants to use a custom symbology the system allows the Audience Producer to select from one or more algorithms stored within the system at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

The aforementioned custom symbology may be a part of an internal process implemented to realize the optimization of pricing as part of an external process for the optimization of pricing or may be made available by any other method apparent to one skilled in the art. Once the symbology assignment process has been completed and the appropriate symbol or symbols have been applied to each audience profile access right or display space access right records the process transmits authorization and attributed symbology for posting to the publisher s account at step .

By way of example an Audience Producer such as a cable television provider seeks to sell audience profile access rights and display space access rights for an upcoming broadcast using the profile based market. In this example the Audience Producer has completed the asset verification process of and has had the asset record posted to its account without corresponding symbology. Following the completion of the asset verification process the data describing the audience profile access rights and display space access rights is transmitted to the symbology module for the application of a symbology algorithm and the assignment of symbols.

Continuing the aforementioned example the revenue that the cable television provider is likely to receive from the sale of the audience profile access rights and display space access rights is optimized using the symbology assignment process . Using this process the price that the cable television provider can receive in the profile based market is based on the demand from advertisers also known as Audience Consumers. Advertiser demand is best reflected by the existing bids to buy within the profile based market s open limit order books and historical prices paid. In such an embodiment the symbology algorithm chosen by the cable television provider or a default selected based on certain conditions is selected based on analysis of the asset records posted to the cable television provider s account.

In order for an advertiser to secure the right to place an advertisement or other content from an Audience Producer a transaction with both the audience profile access right and the corresponding display space access right must be completed. The process begins by matching the symbols of the bid buy offer and the symbols of the ask sell offer. In certain cases counterparties may be excluded from the match by a defined set of counterparties defined within the order or another method apparent to ore skilled in the art.

Based on the criteria of the order entered the audience matching system determines whether the counterparties meet capacity requirements at step . In order for the matching process to continue the capacity requirements as defined by both buy and sell orders must be met in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

Next the audience matching system will match the audience profile access rights contracts and the display space access rights contract in series or parallel. The audience matching system will then complete the following step of the matching process if the profile bid symbol matches the profile ask symbol as determined at step and if the display bid symbol matches the display ask symbol as determined at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Audience profile access right s will be referred to by several names throughout this disclosure including by reference using the term profile s . Further display space access right s will be referred to by several names throughout this disclosure including by reference using the term display s .

The audience matching system then completes the next step of the matching process if the bid price matches the ask price as determined at step for the audience profile access right and if the bid price matches the ask price as determined at step for the display space access right in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. If the system finds that either of the two orders do not match on price the system will post the corresponding order to the respective limit order book at step and or for both the profile access rights order and the display space access rights order. A completed transaction to secure the right to place an advertisement or other content is then initiated if both profile and display processes match as determined at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

Once the primary match requirements are fulfilled other order requirements may be applied for order types such as all or none or other order types apparent to one skilled in the art at step . The next step of the matching process arranges the matched orders by their submission time or other prioritization method apparent to one skilled in the art and arranges the matched orders on the basis first in first out at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Once the transaction is completed the aggregated audience profile access rights and display space access rights are incorporated in an Audience Producer s insertion order or other publishing or fulfillment order apparent to one skilled in the art at the queue inclusion process step.

By way of non limiting example The New York Times is seeking to sell audience profile access rights and display space access rights relating to its NYT.com property for the placement of advertising or other content within its content. In this example The New York Times uses its data describing the attributes of the display space it is offering third party site traffic or ratings data its own audience profile data supplemental third party audience profile data or any other sources of audience profile data apparent to one skilled in the art in the process of creating and defining assets within the profile based market. Further in this example the New York Time offers 1 000 audience profile access rights to assets with symbology indicating membership in group code 45 located in Los Angeles 34 years of age single with a bachelor s degree no children and African American. Additionally in this example The New York Times enters orders to sell the aforementioned audience profile access rights along with 500 display space access rights for 728 90 IMU Leaderboard and 500 display space access rights for 300 250 IMU Medium Rectangle on a page within the business section of its online publication NYT.com.

Continuing the above example with the sell orders entered and submitted the Audience Matching System queries existing bids to buy a total of 1000 of the audience profile access rights described by audience profile access rights listing symbols of TLe New York Times sell order associated bids to buy 500 display space access rights for 500 728 90 IMU Leaderboard described by display space access right listing symbols of The New York Times sell order and associated bids to buy 500 display space access rights for 300 250 IMU Medium Rectangle described by display space access right listing symbols of The New York Times sell order. In this example the audience matching system will match orders to buy and sell on an individual access right basis. Therefore the audience matching system will attempt at least 2000 separate matches where each audience profile access right match is contingent on an associated display space access right match. Matching may take place with or without contingency and for individual or multiple access rights contracts without limitation as is apparent to one skilled in the art.

Once the Audience Matching System finds the first buy and sell orders where the listing symbols for the profile access right and display space access right match i.e. steps and of and the bid price and the ask price of the buy and sell orders match i.e. steps and of the audience matching system transacts one of the two rights contracts and suspends the completion of the transaction until the second of the two rights contracts is transacted or completes the transactions in parallel.

With both transactions in place the audience matching system transmits the asset purchase confirmation to the brokerage system and the insertion order associated with the transacted rights contracts are transmitted to the content delivery system for insertion subject to the access rights contract terms into the NYT.com ad server. The display space access rights may specify by way of non limiting example a specific publishing time and a publishing term e.g. mornings 7 am to 11 am from September 1st through September 31st . NYT.com would then fulfill the order subject to the availability of an audience member with a profile matching the audience profile access right that was sold in conjunction with the display space access right in a first in first out order or any other method of prioritization apparent to one skilled in the art as designated by the audience profile access rights contracts and the display space access rights contracts.

The offer posting process begins when a market participant enters an order at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Once the order is entered the brokerage module receives the order at step and routes the order to the exchange at step .

With the order received by the exchange system the system will use the symbol for the order and determines whether the order has a limit order book at step . If the exchange determines that a limit order book for the order s symbol exists the exchange system posts the order to the limit order book at step .

Alternatively if the exchange determines that there is no limit order book for the symbol of the order the exchange determines if the order is an RFQ CB IOI etc. at step . If the order is not a Request For Quote RFC a Custom Bundle CB Indication Of Interest IOI or any other order type not transacted through an existing limit order book as apparent to one skilled in the art the exchange creates a limit order book at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In such an embodiment if the exchange system determines that the order received was an order type not transacted through a limit order book the order is sent through the alternative order process at step .

By way of non limit example Procter Gamble is seeking to advertise a new Gillette razor on television. In such an example the advertising agency representing the Gillette account uses the profile based market to identify television broadcasters with the appropriate audience profile access rights and display space access rights in the market that represents the time during which the campaign is to be initiated the length of the advertisement to be placed and the audience characteristics which are the target demographics of the campaigns.

In the example the advertising agency will enter one order for audience profile access rights representing males from middle income households identified as early adopters and the associated display space access rights matching their 30 second advertisement. Using the order entry user interface in by way of non limiting example the advertising agency enters the order for the profile access rights and display space access rights at step .

The brokerage module receives the order at step and routes the order to the exchange at step . In such an example the orders entered by the advertising agency have significant liquidity in the market. At step the exchange determines that there is an existing limit order book for both profile access rights and display space access rights and therefore posts the orders to the limit order books at step .

Further in such an example the advertising agency would like to buy an advertising package or bundle of rights from Discovery Networks. Additionally in this example the advertising agency composes a bundle through a user interface and submits the bundled order through the brokerage module. After the exchange receives the order it will determine that there is no limit order book at step and will then determine that the order is a custom bundle at step . In such an example once the order is determined to be a custom bundle the exchange routes the order through the alternative order process at step .

In an embodiment third party data is used to verify that audience production capabilities and associated audience profile characteristic are valid and measured rigorously as the underlying data for the creation of structured advertising assets comprised of audience profile access rights and display space access rights is supported through a user interface that enables Audience Producers to provide their credential to third party data providers data feeds for the import of data to the brokerage system.

In an additional embodiment an Audience Producer or another user such as its agent that wishes to sell audience profile access rights and display space access rights provides data to prove that the capacity and historical performance of their publication or media to draw the volume and quality of the audience necessary to create the assets. In such an embodiment the user interface of the asset verification module depicted in provides a mechanism for the importation of data through an API or other method apparent to one skilled in the art from authorized third party sources that measure audience quality and volumes.

Further in such an embodiment once logged into the brokerage module the Audience Producer is able to navigate to the Trade area of the brokerage module s user interface. In order to create new assets which can be otherwise referred to as forward contracts for the access to an audience and display space audience profile access rights display space access rights a derivative instrument or another instrument apparent to one skilled in the art the Audience Producer is able to select from one of a number of data providers A N and use the link account functionality to provide the user credentials necessary for the system to log in to the audience producer s data provider A N account or API and extract the relevant data.

In such an embodiment the Audience Producer is able to click on the link account link and an additional box window or other method apparent to one skilled in the art which enables the Audience Producer to provide credentials including the user ID and password appears. In such an embodiment once the Audience Producer enters all the relevant data the Audience Producer clicks the link account button to submit the credentials to the brokerage system.

By way of non limiting example Comcast Corporation wishes to sell inventory of future advertising using the profile based market. In order for Comcast to post structured advertising assets consisting of display space access rights and audience profile access rights to their account the Audience Producer Comcast Corporation in this example provides third party data from authorized data providers to begin the asset posting process.

In such an example for Comcast Corporation to provide the data necessary to create the structured advertising assets three data sets must be provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The two data sets required from third party sources or other sources apparent to one skilled in the art are the ratings of the individual broadcasts to determine the number of likely viewers which are used by the system to indicate the volume of assets that will be authorized to be created by the system.

In such an example data from The Nielsen Company measuring the gross ratings points GRP within the media markets that Comcast Corporation serves is used by the asset verification module process of to determine the number of assets that will be authorized for creation. In order for the data to be inputted into asset verification module process Comcast Corporation is able to use the user interface illustrated in to select a data provider A N enter the user ID password re entered Password and any other requested information as required to implement the transmission and storage of the account credentials to the brokerage system using the link account button in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

In such an example the brokerage system may store Comcast Corporation s account credential for The Nielsen Corporation so that the system may extract query or call without limitation additional data from the data vendor e.g. Nielsen . In such an example the brokerage system is configured to use an application programming interface API scheduled data dumps or any other method of information transfer apparent to one skilled in the art. Further in such an example Comcast Corporation provides data that describes the audience profile access rights. For audience profile access rights to be created Comcast Cable must have data regarding the individuals or households depending on the audience profile access rights contracts that will be brought to the market describing various attributes which Audience Consumers will seek to purchase.

In such an example Comcast Corporation uses the user interface illustrated in to select an additional data provider A N enter the user ID password re entered password and submits the account credentials to the brokerage system usirg the link account button. In such an example the brokerage system may store Comcast Corporation s account credential for a data company such as Experian so that the system can extract query or call without limitation additional data from the data vendor. In such an example Comcast Cable can use its subscriber information including subscriber name and address in conjunction with the imported Experian descriptive personal or household data to identify what type of audience profile access right Comcast Cable will be able to produce for sale into the profile based market.

In an embodiment the revenue optimization process is used as part of a profile based market to enable liquidity and market function for any or all identifying symbols that may be used to describe a single asset or a group of assets. The revenue optimization process follows the completion of the symbology algorithm selection process of in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

In the first step the process beings with receipt of one identifying symbol per asset at step from the identifying symbol assignment process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The assets are submitted for transaction optimization at step . Since there are multiple ways to describe a single audience profile asset there may be multiple listing symbols that can describe an asset that is indicated by a single identifying symbol. In such an embodiment the use of differentiated identifying and listing symbols enables a greater degree of order entry simplicity for users and greater simplicity in the matching process.

Using the identifying symbol the next step in the process is to identify listing symbols applicable to the identifying symbols at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention step results in identification of all listing symbols within a set of available listing symbols that apply to the identifying symbols.

The next step is to query historical data for all of the listing symbols at step to measure the historical price performance of the different listing symbols that may be applicable to the identifying symbol in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Further in such an embodiment with the query complete the revenue optimization process now has the indicative data of how the different asset symbols have performed historically in terms of at least transaction price. In order to get a more complete picture for the optimization the process also reviews the current depth of liquidity and market pricing as part of the optimization. Furthermore to gather the data for current market pricing and depth the next step in the process is to query the limit order books for all of the listing symbols at step .

With historical and current market data within the consideration set the process proceeds to prioritize listing symbols for an asset by maximum bids and or historical transaction prices at step in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment the listing symbols are arranged in accordance to an algorithm that accounts for market conditions such as historical transaction prices expected time to sell at a particular price and other criteria as would be appreciated by one skilled in the relevant arts. Based on this information optimum listing symbols for each asset are selected at step . In such an embodiment the optimum listing symbols may not include all listing symbols as the process determines that using some listing symbols may cause the Audience Producer s assets to be sold at a lower price than may be otherwise achieved in the market. Alternatively in such an embodiment the system may select a single optimum listing symbol for the asset.

Once one or more listing symbols have been selected for the asset the process attributes an asset quantity to each listing symbol at step and creates an optimized order posting structure at step which may include but is not limited to different order types such as market limit contingent order cancels order order trigger order dark reserve day good till canceled market on open market on close a stop order or any other order type apparent to one skilled in the art.

In such an embodiment the system then provides the transacting party the opportunity to approve the order posting structure at step modify the order posting structure if necessary at step or accept the order posting structure at step . In such an embodiment once the revenue optimization process is completed the submitted order triggers the offer posting process of .

In an alternate embodiment after step the Audience Consumer may use the liquidity enhancement process of described in further detail below to post each asset for sale using multiple listing symbols and orders to allow for price discovery and optimized revenue generation ability prior to posting the assets for sale using the offer posting process of .

By way of non limiting example News Corporation an Audience Producer has multiple television and print publications which are delivered through addressable and non addressable means. In such an example News Corporation wishes to sell display space access right and audience profile access rights to one or more Audience Consumers advertisers for the placement of advertising or other media. News Corporation uses its subscriber list and purchases additional descriptive household or personal data from a marketing data provider such as Experian or Axciom or uses another method where personally identifiable information is not exposed as is apparent to one skilled in the art to enhance the audience profile access right descriptive data.

To use the revenue optimization process News Corporation begins by submitting its subscriber data along with the data that it has purchased to the identifying symbol assignment process of for the assignment of a single identifying symbol for each individual or household audience member subscriber profile. In such an embodiment News Corporation receives one identifying symbol per asset at step . The selected assets are then submitted for transaction optimization at step .

Next listing symbols applicable to the asset symbol are identified at step and an aggregate list is provided for further processing. In such an example News Corporation s millions of subscribers will each be described by one or more listing symbols. Because of the varied types of Audience Consumers that wish to buy rights for the placement of advertising or other media the optimum symbology for all of the assets that News Corporation wishes to sell may require significant computational aralysis. In such an example News Corporation uses the process to query historical data for all listing symbols at step and also to query limit order books for all listing symbols at step .

The data provided to News Corporation in this example indicates that there is a significant portion of their audience that can be best described using the in market for a new automobile categorization as a key driver for maximizing the price of the audience profile access right. Further the same audience members can also be described as dog owners households with children and in market for a tropical vacation for example. In such an example the revenue optimization process provides a suggested combination of one or more symbols for these assets to maximize the price of the asset sales over time through prioritization of the listing symbols assets by maximum bids and or historical transaction prices at step and the selection of multiple optimum listing symbols for each asset at step .

In such an example the process provides an optimized combination of one or more symbols based on an estimate related to historical transactions and existing market demand. In such an example the process provides News Corporation with a symbology combination which it may approve at step . In such an example without limitation News Corporation is provided with symbology combinations that allow the listing of audience members using multiple symbols where symbols indicating dog ownership in market for a new automobile presence of children in the household and in market for a tropical vacation can be used in combination or independently to generate numerous listing symbols for each audience profile access right. The process provides News Corporation with symbology combinations that will maximize revenue over the course of a six week period relative to the assets offered. However the business objectives of News Corporation in this example require a much quicker sale and the Audience Producer News Corporation creates modifies order posting structures at step to ensure that is able to sell its assets over a much shorter period of time. Further in such an example News Corporation may then offer inventory for sale at step by entering an order to sell the inventory through the brokerage system. With the order entered the revenue optimization process ends and the offer posting process of begins in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

In an embodiment the liquidity enhancement process is used as part of a profile based market to enable liquidity of assets within but not limited to narrowly described asset pools that provide true price discovery. Audience Producers understand that different Audience Consumers buy access to the same audience members subscribers on the basis of different elements within the data describing those audience members subscribers. Accordingly in such an embodiment when the symbology assignment process of is completed the listing symbols assigned progress to the liquidity enhancement process .

The process begins with receiving listing symbols for each asset at step . Using the quantity associated with the listing symbol that was transmitted by the symbology assignment process the process next attributes a quantity of an identifying symbol for the asset to each listing symbol . The process then creates an order cancels order order for all of the associated listing symbols at step .

In such an embodiment the market participant may use automated algorithmic manual processes or other process apparent to one skilled in the art to determine the quantity and asking price for each listing symbol in the order cancels order order. Once the selection of prices and quantities is completed the process will submit order cancels order orders to the exchange for matching at step . In such an embodiment the exchange receives the order cancels order orders and posts each order cancels order order to the limit order books for each of the listing symbols at step .

User interface provides by way of non limiting example fields for navigating to the order entry user interface for the identification and selection of the account within with to transact the total account value of the selected account the cash available to buy within the selected account the cash used within the selected account to select the order type of the entered order to enter the symbol of the audience profile access right to enter the order price of the profile access right to select an action associated with the order type to enter the quantity of the desired order to select the time in force of the order to select the beginning date for order delivery to select the close date for the order delivery to place the order to enter the symbol of the display space access right to enter the order price of the display space access right and to select an action associated with the order type.
