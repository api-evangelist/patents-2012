The present invention generally relates to computing devices and more particularly to expanded icon functionality for use with a computing device.

The use of computing devices such as for example desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers mobile phone computers and or a variety of other computing devices known in the art is becoming ubiquitous. With the rising popularity of mobile computing users may interact with computing devices throughout their day in order to retrieve and or provide information for a variety of reasons. As such interactions become more and more frequent it becomes desirable to make those interactions as quick and efficient as possible.

One way in which user computing device interactions have been made quicker and more efficient is through the use of icons or graphical symbols which may represent an application a user created shortcut and or a variety of other icon represented entities known in the art. The icons are then displayed on the computing device e.g. by an operating system for selection by the user. When a user wishes to use an application shortcut or other icon represented entity they simply select the associated icon in order to provide instructions to the computing device to launch the application open the shortcut and or otherwise execute instructions for a desired icon represented entity.

However a user may still need to go through a number of manual steps each time an icon is selected. For example a user that typically uses a particular function of an application regularly may need to go through the same repetitive steps each time they wish to access that application function select the application icon wait for the application to load then navigate through the application until the particular function is available. In another example a user that typically uses a particular section of a website to which they have created a shortcut may need to go through similar steps each time they wish to use that section of the website select the website shortcut icon wait for the website to load then navigate through the website until the particular section of the website is available. These repetitive steps to get to the functionality desired by the user are inefficient and create a negative user experience.

According to one embodiment a method for providing expanded icon functionality includes associating secondary icons with a primary icon and a second user action in a storage device. When a first user action is directed to the primary icon a primary icon function is performed. The primary icon function may include for example launching an application or a primary webpage on a website. When the second user action is directed to the primary icon the secondary icons are retrieved and displayed. When one of the secondary icons is selected a secondary icon function is performed. The secondary icon function may include for example a particular function performed by an application or the launching a secondary webpage on a website.

In an embodiment the positioning of the secondary icons may be determined dynamically based on the location of the primary icon and or the number of secondary icons associated with the primary icon which allows the display of the secondary icons to be optimized for a display device being used.

As a result a user may create a number of secondary icons that allow the user to access or quickly reference functions of an application or webpages on a website which provides for quicker and more efficient interactions with the user device.

These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

The present disclosure provides a system and method for providing expanded icon functionality. Secondary icons and in some embodiments tertiary icons quaternary icons and so on are associated with a primary icon and a second user action in a storage device. In response to a first user action e.g. a user tap action directed to the primary icon a primary icon function e.g. launching an application launching a primary webpage on a website etc. is performed. In response to the second user action directed to the primary icon the secondary icons are retrieved and displayed and when any of the secondary icons are selected a respective secondary icon function is performed e.g. performing a particular function of an application launching a secondary webpage on a website etc. Such systems and methods allow for a user to quickly and easily instruct a user device to perform several different functions associated with a primary icon that conventionally requires the user to navigate through an application or website following selection of the primary icon.

Referring now to a method for provided expanded icon functionality which may also be referred to as icon nodal interaction herein is illustrated. The embodiment of the method described below is directed to a primary icon associated with a payment account of a user. For example an account provider may provide a user with a payment account and the user may use the primary icon to access the payment account to fund payments for purchases made from merchants review details of the payment account and or perform a variety of other payment account activities known in the art. In another embodiment a payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. assists in the making of payments from the user to merchants by transferring funds from the payment account to a merchant account of the merchant and the primary icon may allow the user to perform similar actions as discussed above for the payment account provided by the provider. However these embodiments are meant to be merely exemplary and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of modifications may be made to the system discussed below without departing from the scope of the present disclosure including the use of the system with primary icons for any application user created shortcut and or other icon represented entity known in the art.

The method begins at block where a plurality of secondary icons are associated with a primary icon and a second user action. In the embodiment discussed below a user having a user device illustrated in may access their payer account over a network e.g. over the Internet by selecting a primary icon to connect to an account provider device a payment service provider device an application provider device and or other devices known in the art. While the user device is illustrated and described below as a mobile device such as for example a mobile phone or computer one of skill in the art will recognize that the icon system discussed below may be provided on a desktop computer on other computing systems connected to a network and or using a variety of other devices known in the art.

As illustrated in the user device includes a display screen that is operable to display a plurality of primary icons including for example the primary icon . While the plurality of primary icons in are displayed in a grid on a single screen one of skill in the art will recognize that the primary icons may be displayed in any configuration and across any number of screens while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. In the embodiment discussed below the display screen is a touch sensitive input device that allows a user of the user device to provide instructions and inputs to the user device by touching the display screen .

In an embodiment the user device is operable to perform an associated primary icon function in response to receiving a first user action that is directed to a primary icon. For example the primary icon may be associated with a payment application as discussed above and in response to a first user action directed to the primary icon e.g. a user tap action in which the user touches the display screen a single time at a location on the display screen where the primary icon is displayed the user device may launch the payment application associated with the primary icon such that the user may navigate through the payment application to access different functionality of the payment application. However in other embodiments the primary icon may be associated with a user shortcut to a primary webpage of a website e.g. a homepage of a website and in response to the first user action the user device may launch a web browser directed to the primary webpage such that the user may navigate through the website starting from the primary webpage. The user device may be operable to perform an associated primary icon function for each of the primary icons in response to the same type of first user action e.g. the user tap action directed to the respective primary icon thus allowing the user to provide instructions to the user device to launch applications user created shortcuts and or other icon represented entities displayed on the display screen using a first type of intuitive gesture. While a few examples of primary icon functions have been provided one of skill in the art will recognize that any type of primary icon function with fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring to at block in the illustrated embodiment the user may select the primary icon using the first user action to instruct the user device to launch the payment application associated with the primary icon . The user may then navigate through the payment application to an expanded icon functionality screen illustrated in . The expanded icon functionality page include an indication of the primary icon that was selected e.g. the primary icon in and that is having its icon functionality expanded according to the method . The expanded icon functionality screen also includes a second user action input that allows the user to select a second user action e.g. a user double tap action in which the user touches the display screen two times at a location on the display screen where the desired icon is displayed to be associated with the primary icon and one or more secondary icons. The expanded icon functionality page also includes a secondary icon section that includes a plurality of secondary icon inputs that allows the user to associate secondary icons and secondary icon functions with each other the second user action and the primary icon.

In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icon section includes a secondary icon that may be displayed on the display screen in response to the user directing the second user action at the primary icon along with a secondary icon function that the user has selected that will provide the user device instructions to launch a companion application to the payment application associated with the primary icon when the secondary icon is selected. For example the payment application associated with the primary icon may provide for management of a payment account of the user while a companion application to the payment application may provide the user device the ability to read credit cards for accepting payments and thus the user may associate the secondary icon for the companion application along with the secondary icon function of launching the companion application with the primary icon and the second user action in a storage device of the user device at block of the method . Such an expanded icon functionality may be useful for a user that uses both the payment application and companion application regularly and wishes to save space on the display screen by associating the two applications and providing for accessing the companion application through icon nodal interactions with payment application icon.

In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icon section includes a secondary icon that may be displayed on the display screen in response to the user directing the second user action at the primary icon along with a secondary icon function that the user has selected that will provide the user device instructions to launch an application web version of the payment application associated with the primary icon when the secondary icon is selected. For example the payment application associated with the primary icon may provide for accessing a payment account of the user through a relatively data intensive application while a mobile web version of the payment application may provide for accessing that payment account through a relatively less data intensive webpage and thus the user may associate the secondary icon for the mobile web version of the payment application along with the secondary icon function of launching the mobile web version of the payment application with the primary icon and the second user action in a storage device of the user device at block of the method . Such an expanded icon functionality may be useful when a user finds themselves in an area where their network connection is slow and the use of a relatively less data intensive webpage version of the payment application will provide a better user experience than the relatively data intensive payment application.

In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icon section includes a secondary icon that may be displayed on the display screen in response to the user directing the second user action at the primary icon along with a secondary icon function that the user has selected that will provide the user device instructions to launch the payment application associated with the primary icon in another language and or another currency when the secondary icon is selected. For example the payment application associated with the primary icon may provide for accessing a payment account of the user in a first language e.g. English and or currency e.g. U.S. dollars or a plurality of second languages e.g. Chinese and or currencies e.g. Yuan and thus the user may associate the secondary icon for the second language and or currency version of the payment application along with the secondary icon function of launching second language and or currency version of the payment application with the primary icon and the second user action in a storage device of the user device at block of the method . Such an expanded icon functionality may be useful when a user uses the payment application in a plurality of different countries having different currencies.

In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icon section includes a secondary icon that may be displayed on the display screen in response to the user directing the second user action at the primary icon along with a secondary icon function that the user has selected that will provide the user device instructions to display a payment account balance for a payment account in the payment application associated with the primary icon when the secondary icon is selected. For example the payment application associated with the primary icon may provide for accessing a payment account balance of a payment account of the user and thus the user may associate the secondary icon for the payment account balance along with the secondary icon function of displaying the payment account balance with the primary icon and the second user action in a storage device of the user device at block of the method . Such an expanded icon functionality may be useful when a user checks their payment account balance regularly and or wishes to be able to quickly and easily access their payment account balance.

In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icon section includes a secondary icon that may be displayed on the display screen in response to the user directing the second user action at the primary icon along with a secondary icon function that the user has selected that will provide the user device instructions to launch an accessibility settings screen for the payment application associated with the primary icon when the secondary icon is selected. For example the payment application associated with the primary icon may provide for adjusting a plurality of settings of the payment application and thus the user may associate the secondary icon for the accessibility settings screen of the payment application along with the secondary icon function of launching the accessibility settings screen with the primary icon and the second user action in a storage device of the user device at block of the method . Such an expanded icon functionality may be useful when a user regularly changings accessibility settings for the payment application and or wishes to be able to quickly and easily access their accessibility settings.

The associations of the primary icon the second user action the secondary icons and the secondary icon functions may be stored in a storage device in the user device or connected to the user device through a network e.g. via an account provider device a payment service provider device an application provider device etc. Thus any or all of the primary icons may be associated with a second user action and one or more secondary icons and associated secondary icons functions in the storage device. While a few examples of secondary icons and secondary icon functions have been provided above one of skill in the art will recognize that a plurality of different icon types and icon functions will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. For example the primary icon may include user created short cut to a primary webpage of a website e.g. a homepage and the user may select for association with the second user action and primary icon secondary icons with secondary icon functions that allow the user to open up secondary webpages of the website e.g. webpages that conventionally would require the user to navigate to from the website homepage. 

Furthermore while the second user action secondary icons and secondary icon functions have been described above as being set by the user of the user device second user actions secondary icons and secondary icon functions may be set by a third party e.g. an application developer a website developer a user device manufacturer and or a variety of other entities known in the art while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. For example the icon nodal interaction involving the second user action secondary icons and secondary icon functions may be provided with associations to primary icons by application developers in application updates over the network to the user device .

Further still third user actions fourth user actions and so on may be associated with the primary icon any of the secondary icons and or lower level icons in the expanded icon functionality system in a manner similar to the association of the second user action and secondary icons with the primary icon discussed above. For example a third user action may include a user triple tap that requires a user to touch the display screen three times at a location adjacent the display of an icon and that third user action may be associated with one or more tertiary icons that are similar to the secondary icons and that are associated with tertiary icon functions that are similar to the secondary icon functions. Also while the primary secondary and tertiary user actions have been described herein as tap actions that include single double and triple taps other user gestures or actions directed the primary icons secondary icons and other icons will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. For example swiping e.g. running a finger in a relatively straight line across the screen starting or crossing over an icon swirls e.g. running a finger in a relatively circular motion along the screen starting or cross over an icon and or a variety of other user gestures or actions are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

The method then proceeds to block where a primary icon is displayed. As discussed above illustrates the display of a plurality of primary icons in a grid and the user device is operable to perform a primary icon function for any of the primary icons in response to a first user action directed to that primary icon. While the method below describes the function of the user device in response to a second user action directed to the primary icon any of the primary icons may be associated with the second user action as discussed above and thus the actions performed according to the method may apply to any of the primary icons displayed on the display screen of the user device and or any icons displayed on any computing system known in the art.

The method then proceeds to block where a second user action that is directed to a primary icon is received. In an embodiment the user may perform a second user action on the display screen of the user device that is directed to the primary icon and the user device receives that second user action. For example the user may perform a user double tap action on a touch input display screen that is at the location of the display of the primary icon on the display screen . In another example the user may user an input device such as for example a mouse or touch pad to double click on or otherwise select the primary icon with a second user action that is different from a primary user action that causes the user device to perform the primary icon function associated with that primary icon . While a few examples of second user actions have been described one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of different user actions using a variety of different hardware and or software will fall within the scope of the present disclosure including but not limited to taps clicks swipes swirls and or other user actions known in the art.

Referring now to and the method then proceeds to block where secondary icons are retrieved and displayed. In an embodiment in response to receiving the second user action at block the user device accesses the storage device in the user device and uses the primary icon to which the second user action was directed along with the second user action received at block to retrieve one or more secondary icons that are associated with the primary icon and second user action in the storage device. The user device then displays the secondary icons on an expanded icon functionality screen provided on the display screen of the user device . The expanded icon functionality screen includes a primary icon which may be the same as the primary icon to which the second user action was directed at block but for example enlarged in the illustrated embodiment along with a plurality of secondary icons and that are associated with that primary icon and the second user action received at block . In the illustrated embodiment the secondary icons and may be the companion application icon the mobile web version icon the alternate language and or currency icon the account balance icon and the accessibility settings icon respectively discussed above with reference to . While in the illustrated embodiment each of the secondary icons and are displayed on the display screen of the user device as nodes connected to the primary icon a variety of other secondary icon presentations will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

The method then proceeds to block where a selection of a secondary icon is received. In an embodiment upon being presented with the expanded icon the user may select one of the secondary icons and in order to instruct the user device to perform a secondary icon function that is associated with that selected secondary icon. For example the user may perform a user tap action on the secondary icon in order to launch a companion application to the payment application that is associated with the primary icon . In another example the user may perform a user tap action on the secondary icon in order to launch a mobile web version to the payment application that is associated with the primary icon . In another example the user may perform a user tap action on the secondary icon in order to launch the payment application that is associated with the primary icon in an alternate language and or currency In another example the user may perform a user tap action on the secondary icon in order to cause an account balance to be displayed for a payment account associated with the payment application that is associated with the primary icon as illustrated in . In another example the user may perform a user tap action on the secondary icon in order to launch an accessibility settings page associated with the payment application that is associated with the primary icon .

While a few examples of secondary icon functions have been provided a wide variety of different secondary icon functions may be performed in response to the selection of a secondary icon. In the illustrated embodiment described above selection of secondary icons are described as resulting in the immediate provision of companion applications mobile web versions of applications applications in a selected language and or currency information sections of applications such as a payment account balance and settings pages of applications. However as discussed above secondary icons may be associated with a primary icon that is a user created shortcut e.g. to a primary webpage of a website and selection of those secondary icons may result in the immediate provision of secondary webpages for the website e.g. through a web browser that are associated with e.g. navigable to from the primary webpage of the website. Furthermore some secondary icons may have secondary icon functionality that is performed without explicit selection of that secondary icon. For example in some embodiments the account balance provided by the secondary icon may be displayed and or updated on the expanded icon functionality screen without being selected by the user.

Thus a system and method for providing expanded icon functionality has been described that allows a user to associated a second user action with primary icon and one or more secondary icons such that the second user action directed at the primary icon causes the secondary icons to be displayed for selection. Such a system and method allow the user to create one or more secondary icons or short cuts to quickly navigate to different functionality of an application website and or other entity associated with the primary icon.

Referring now to a plurality of secondary icon display options that are based on the position of the primary icon and or the number of secondary icons associated with the primary icon are illustrated on different expanded icon functionality screens. illustrates a first expanded icon functionality screen having a primary icon displayed at a first position relative to the display screen on the user device .
