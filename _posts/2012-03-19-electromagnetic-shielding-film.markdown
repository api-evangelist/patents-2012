This application is a continuation of co pending application Ser. No. 12 116 305 filed on May 7 2008 which claims foreign priority to Japanese application No. 2007 124696 filed on May 9 2007. The entire content of each of these applications is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to an electromagnetic shielding film and an optical filter particularly to an electromagnetic shielding film and an optical filter that are light transmittable and capable of shielding electromagnetic waves from front surfaces of display devices such as CRTs cathode ray tubes PDPs plasma display panels liquid crystal displays EL electroluminescence displays and FEDs field emission displays microwave ovens electronic devices printed circuit boards and the like.

Problems of electro magnetic interference EMI have been rapidly increasing in recent years along with increase in the use of various electric and applied electronic equipments. It has been indicated that the EMI causes malfunction or failure of the electronic or electric equipment and further causes health disorder of an operator of the equipment. Therefore the electronic and electric equipments are required to reduce the intensity of an electromagnetic wave therefrom to make it within a standard or a regulation.

The electromagnetic wave has to be shielded to solve the EMI problems and a metal having a non transmissivity to the electromagnetic wave can be utilized for the shielding obviously. For example the electromagnetic wave can be shielded by a method of using a housing of a metal or a highly conductive material a method of inserting a metal plate between circuit boards a method of covering a cable with a metal foil etc. Display devices such as CRTs and PDPs need to be light transmittable such that the operator can recognize characters shown on the screen. However in the case of using the above methods the front surface of the display device is likely to be opaque. Thus the methods are unsuitable for shielding the electromagnetic wave from the display devices.

Particularly the PDPs generate a larger amount of the electromagnetic wave as compared with the CRTs or the like whereby electromagnetic shielding materials for the PDPs are required to have a higher electromagnetic shielding ability. The electromagnetic shielding ability can be simply represented by the surface resistance. The light transmittable electromagnetic shielding materials for the PDPs need to have a surface resistance of 2.5 sq or less while those for the CRTs need to have a surface resistance of about 300 sq or less. In a consumer plasma television using the PDP the electromagnetic shielding material is required to have a remarkably high conductivity with a surface resistance of 1.5 sq or less more desirably 0.1 sq or less.

The light transmittance of the electromagnetic shielding material is required to be about 70 or more in the CRT and about 80 or more in the PDP and there is a demand for further improving the light transmittance.

Generally a film material produced by forming a metal mesh on a film is used as the electromagnetic shielding material for the plasma display panel PDP having excellent light transmittance and high electromagnetic shielding properties. However a moire is often generated due to interference between the film material and a pixel pattern of the PDP.

Conventional fiber meshes have large wire widths to achieve high conductivity and thereby the moire is easily generated see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 5 327274 etc. The moire can be effectively reduced by thinning a wire of the mesh pattern. For example a thin wire having a width of about 10 m obtained by etching a copper foil is described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2003 046293. However this method is disadvantageous in complicated production process and in high cost.

As a method for forming the mesh pattern with improved productivity an electroless plating method which contains printing fine metal particles as a catalyst and depositing a conductive metal on the printed fine metal particles is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 11 170420 2004 068119 and 2004 068120. Further a mesh pattern forming method using a silver salt diffusion transfer process is proposed in WO 2004 007810 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2004 172041. However in these methods when the wire width of the mesh pattern is reduced the surface resistance representing the electromagnetic shielding property is increased. Further these methods are poor in wire resolution. Thus in these methods the mesh pattern has a large wire width of 20 to 30 m so that the moire cannot be sufficiently reduced.

Further a method of developing a silver halide to form a conductive mesh of metallic silver and a method of plating the developed silver mesh with copper to form a conductive mesh are proposed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2004 221564 etc.

The problem of the moire can be solved to some extent by optimizing the bias angle of the mesh for each of PDP pixel patterns. However a large number of suitable films are needed for the PDP pixel patterns whereby this method is disadvantageous in increased cost and storage. To reduce the number of the films it is necessary to produce an electromagnetic shielding material having a wide acceptable angular range within which the moire is not generated by the PDP pixel pattern.

In the case of improving the productivity by selecting the mesh forming method the surface resistance is increased by reducing the wire width or the wire width cannot be reduced due to limitations of thin wire mesh resolution so that the moire is often increased. Thus there is a demand for a method for reducing the moire without thinning the metal wire in the mesh.

Under such circumstances an object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic shielding film and an optical filter that are highly light transmittable and electromagnetic shieldable and capable of minimizing image quality deterioration due to moire or the like.

In ordinary crossed mesh patterns in the relation between the moire and the wire width the moire is unnoticeable when the wire is thin for example at a wire width of 10 m or less whereas the moire is highly visible when the wire becomes thicker for example at a wire width of 15 m or more. As described above as the wire of the mesh is thickened widened the moire is increased. Though the moire can be effectively reduced by thinning the wire of the mesh pattern the thinning results in surface resistance increase and complicated production process disadvantageously.

In intense research in view of solving the above problem the inventor has found that the moire can be reduced by disposing a moire preventing part in an opening portion formed in a mesh line. This seems because by forming the moire preventing part the integral quantity of a light transmitted through a conductive metal thin film mesh is made substantially uniform in wire intersections and the other positions as if the mesh pattern is not present so that the moire is hardly generated.

The present invention has been achieved as a result of research based on the finding that the moire can be reduced by disposing the moire preventing part in the opening portion of an electromagnetic shielding film having the opening portion and the conductive portion.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.

An embodiment of the electromagnetic shielding film and the optical filter of the present invention will be described below with reference to .

As shown in an electromagnetic shielding film according to the embodiment has conductive portions and opening portions and moire preventing parts are formed in the opening portions .

When the conductive portions and the opening portions are combined into a mesh pattern as shown in each moire preventing part may be formed approximately at the center of the opening portion . Alternatively as shown in the moire preventing part may be formed on a line connecting intersections facing each other of the conductive portions in the mesh pattern.

Further as shown in four intersections a first intersection and a second intersection facing each other and a third intersection and a fourth intersection facing each other may be formed around the opening portion and the moire preventing part may be formed at the intersection point of a first line connecting the first intersection and the second intersection and a second line connecting the third intersection and the fourth intersection

The planar shape of the moire preventing part may be a substantially circular shape as shown in or a polygonal shape such as a quadrangular pentagonal hexagonal or octagonal shape as shown in . Of course the planar shape of the moire preventing part may contain at least one curved portion as shown in .

When Sa represents the area of the intersection of the conductive portions and Sb represents the area of the moire preventing part Sa and Sb preferably satisfy 0.1Sa Sb 5.0Sa.

Further Sa and Sb more preferably satisfy 0.1Sa Sb 1.9Sa further more preferably satisfy 0.5Sa Sb 1.5Sa most preferably satisfy 0.9Sa Sb 1.1Sa.

In the case of not forming the moire preventing parts in the opening portions as shown in the integral quantity of a light transmitted through the opening portions is distributed as shown in when projected onto one side of the film. In positions other than the intersections for example positions shown by virtual lines A and B the conductive portions are distributed at the same ratio so that the integral quantity is approximately uniform. In a position having the intersections shown by a virtual line C two conductive portions are united into one so that the integral quantity of the transmitted light is increased. Such positions in which the integral quantity is increased are disposed in line with a spatial frequency according to the arrangement of the intersections .

When an optical filter containing an electromagnetic shielding film having such a property is used in a PDP or the like moire is generated due to the spatial frequency difference between PDP pixels and the above positions with increased integral quantity of the transmitted light .

In contrast in this embodiment the moire preventing parts are formed in the opening portions of the electromagnetic shielding film as shown in and A so that the integral quantity of the transmitted light is not locally increased and is approximately uniform over the entire film as shown in . Thus the moire is hardly generated as if the mesh pattern of the conductive portions and the opening portions is not present.

Therefore the electromagnetic shielding film of this embodiment is excellent in both the electromagnetic shielding property and light transmittance and capable of minimizing image quality deterioration due to the moire or the like.

As shown in the electromagnetic shielding film of this embodiment may have a specific structure containing a transparent support and a mesh patterned conductive metal thin film hereinafter referred to as the mesh pattern formed thereon. The moire preventing parts are formed in the opening portions of the mesh pattern .

In the electromagnetic shielding film of this embodiment the mesh pattern may be formed by exposing developing and fixing a photosensitive silver salt layer on the transparent support to form a metallic silver portion and by disposing a conductive metal on the metallic silver portion.

Specifically as shown in the transparent support is coated with a photosensitive silver salt layer which is formed by mixing a silver halide e.g. silver bromide particles silver chlorobromide particles silver iodobromide particles with a gelatin . Though the silver halide is exaggeratingly shown as particles in A to C to facilitate understanding the size concentration etc. of the silver halide are not limited to the drawings.

Then as shown in the photosensitive silver salt layer is subjected to an exposure treatment for forming the mesh pattern . When an optical energy is applied to the silver halide a minute silver nucleus a latent image invisible to the naked eye is generated.

As shown in a development treatment is carried out to convert the latent image to an image visible to the naked eye. Specifically the photosensitive silver salt layer having the latent image is developed using a developer which is an alkaline or acidic solution generally an alkaline solution. In the development treatment using the latent image silver nucleus as a catalyst core a silver ion from the silver halide particles or the developer is reduced to metallic silver by a reducing agent called a developing agent in the developer. As a result the latent image silver nucleus is grown to form a visible silver image a developed silver .

The photosensitive silver halide remains in the photosensitive silver salt layer after the development treatment. As shown in the silver halide is removed by a fixation treatment using a fixer which is an acidic or alkaline solution generally an acidic solution.

After the fixation treatment the metallic silver portion is disposed in an exposed area and only the gelatin remains in an unexposed area as a light transmittable portion . Thus the combination of the metallic silver portion and the light transmittable portion is formed on the transparent support .

In a case where silver bromide is used as the silver halide and a thiosulfate salt is used in the fixation treatment a reaction represented by the following formula proceeds in the fixation treatment. AgBr solid 2SOions Ag SO readily water soluble complex 

Two thiosulfate SOions and a silver ion in the gelatin a silver ion from AgBr are reacted to generate a silver thiosulfate complex. The silver thiosulfate complex has high water solubility and thereby is eluted from the gelatin . As a result the developed silver is fixed as the metallic silver portion .

Thus the latent image is reacted with the reducing agent to deposit the developed silver in the development step and the residual silver halide not converted to the developed silver is eluted into water in the fixation step. The steps are described in detail in T. H. James 4th ed. Macmillian Publishing Co. Inc. NY Chapter 15 pp. 438 442 1977.

An alkaline solution is generally used in the development treatment. Therefore the alkaline solution used in the development treatment may be mixed into the fixer generally an acidic solution for the fixation treatment whereby the activity of the fixer may be disadvantageously changed. Further the developer may remain on the film taken out of the development bath whereby an undesired development reaction may further progress. Thus it is preferred that the photosensitive silver salt layer is neutralized or acidified by a quencher such as an acetic acid solution after the development treatment and before the fixation treatment.

Then for example as shown in a conductive metal is deposited only on the metallic silver portion by a plating treatment an electroless plating treatment an electroplating treatment or a combination thereof . Thus the mesh pattern containing the metallic silver portion and the conductive metal supported thereon is formed on the transparent support .

The difference between the above mentioned method using the photosensitive silver salt layer a silver salt photography technology and a method using a photoresist a resist technology will be described below.

In the resist technology a photopolymerization initiator absorbs a light in an exposure treatment to initiate a reaction a photoresist film a resin per se undergoes a polymerization reaction to increase or decrease solubility in a developer and the resin in an exposed area or an unexposed area is removed in a development treatment. The developer used in the resist technology may be an alkaline solution free of reducing agents in which an unreacted resin component can be dissolved. On the other hand as described above in the silver salt photography technology according to the present invention the minute silver nucleus the so called latent image is formed from silver ion and photoelectron generated in the exposed silver halide in the exposure treatment. The latent image silver nucleus is grown to form the visible silver image in the development treatment using the developer which must contain the reducing agent the developing agent . Thus the resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different in the reactions in the exposure and development treatments.

In the development treatment of the resist technology the unpolymerized resin portion in the exposed or unexposed area is removed. On the other hand in the development treatment of the silver salt photography technology using the latent image as the catalyst core the reduction reaction is conducted by the reducing agent the developing agent contained in the developer and the developed silver is grown into a visible size. The gelatin in the unexposed area is not removed in the silver salt photography technology. Thus the resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different also in the reactions in the development treatments.

The silver halide contained in the gelatin in the unexposed area is eluted in the following fixation treatment and the gelatin itself is not removed.

As described above the main reaction component the photosensitive component is the silver halide in the silver salt photography technology while it is the photopolymerization initiator in the resist technology. Further in the development treatment the binder the gelatin remains in the silver salt photography technology while it is removed in the resist technology. The resist technology and the silver salt photography technology are greatly different in these points.

The photosensitive silver salt layer may be exposed using a mask having a mask pattern corresponding to the mesh pattern and a pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions .

Alternatively the photosensitive silver salt layer may be exposed using digital writing corresponding to the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions .

The mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions may be formed by another method such that a photoresist film is formed on a copper foil disposed on the transparent support and exposed and developed to form a resist pattern as shown in and the copper foil exposed from the resist pattern is etched as shown in . In this method the photoresist film may be exposed using a mask having a mask pattern corresponding to the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts .

Alternatively the photoresist film may be exposed using digital writing corresponding to the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts .

Further the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions may be formed by printing a paste containing fine metal particles on the transparent support as shown in and by plating the paste with a metal to form a metal plating layer as shown in .

Furthermore the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions may be printed onto the transparent support using a screen printing plate or a gravure printing plate as shown in .

The method for producing the electromagnetic shielding film of this embodiment particularly a preferred method using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for forming the conductive metal thin film will be described in detail below.

As described above the conductive shielding film of the embodiment may be produced such that a photosensitive material having the transparent support and a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer formed thereon is exposed and developed whereby the metallic silver portion and the light transmittable portion are formed in the exposed area and the unexposed area respectively and the metallic silver portion is subjected to a physical development and or a plating treatment to deposit the conductive metal thereon.

Specific examples of methods for forming the conductive shielding film include the following three processes different in the photosensitive materials and development treatments.

 1 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nucleus to a chemical or thermal development to form the metallic silver portion on the photosensitive material.

 2 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the metallic silver portion on the photosensitive material.

 3 A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nucleus and an image receiving sheet having a non photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development so as to form the metallic silver portion on the non photosensitive image receiving sheet.

The process of 1 is an integral black and white development type method capable of forming the electromagnetic shielding film a light transmittable conductive film or the like on the photosensitive material. The resulting developed silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver having a structure of high specific surface area filament and shows a high activity in the following plating treatment or physical development.

In the process of 2 silver halide particles are melted around the physical development nuclei and deposited on the nuclei in an exposed area so as to form the light transmittable electromagnetic shielding film the light transmittable conductive film or the like on the photosensitive material. Also the process of 2 is an integral black and white development type method. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.

In the process of 3 silver halide particles are melted in an unexposed area and diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image receiving sheet to form the electromagnetic shielding film the light transmittable conductive film or the like on the image receiving sheet. The process of 3 is a so called separate type method and the image receiving sheet is peeled from the photosensitive material.

A negative development treatment or a reversal development treatment can be used in these processes. In the diffusion transfer development the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto positive material as the photosensitive material.

The chemical development thermal development solution physical development and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin ichi Kikuchi Kyoritsu Shuppan Co.

The plastic film and plate may be colored as long as they do not interfere with the advantageous effects of the present invention.

The photosensitive material may have a protective layer formed on an emulsion layer to be hereinafter described. The protective layer used in this embodiment comprises a binder such as a gelatin or high molecular polymer and is formed on a photosensitive emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property. It is preferred that the protective layer is not formed in view of the plating treatment. When the protective layer is formed it preferably has a smaller thickness. The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.2 m or less. The protective layer may be formed by an appropriate known coating method though not particularly restricted.

The photosensitive material for the producing method of this embodiment preferably has the emulsion layer containing a silver salt as a light sensor a silver salt containing layer on the transparent support .

In the exposure development method a photosensitive material having a silver salt containing layer or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is formed on the transparent support and the photosensitive material is exposed. The material may be exposed using an electromagnetic wave. For example the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light an ultraviolet light a radiation ray including an X ray.

It is appropriate that a main irradiation for drawing crossline pattern is conducted in combination with an auxiliary irradiation for intermittently irradiating only the intersections to draw the composite mesh pattern image. The main irradiation and the auxiliary irradiation may be simultaneously carried out while transporting the photosensitive surface once. Alternatively the auxiliary irradiation may be carried out after the scanning exposure by the main irradiation while transporting the photosensitive surface again.

The pH of the fixer is preferably 4.0 to 6.5 particularly preferably 4.5 to 6.0. Further compounds described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 64 4739 may be used as a dye elution accelerator.

Examples of the film hardening agents for the fixer used in the present invention include water soluble aluminum salts and chromium salts. The film hardening agent is preferably a water soluble aluminum salt such as aluminum chloride aluminum sulfate or potassium alum. The amount of the film hardening agent is preferably 0.01 to 0.2 mol L more preferably 0.03 to 0.08 mol L.

In the fixation treatment the fixation temperature is preferably about 20 C. to 50 C. more preferably 25 C. to 45 C. The fixation time is preferably 5 seconds to 1 minute more preferably 7 to 50 seconds. The amount of the fixer is preferably 600 ml mor less more preferably 500 ml mor less particularly preferably 300 ml mor less per the amount of the photosensitive material to be treated.

The developed and fixed photosensitive material is preferably subjected to a water washing treatment or a stabilization treatment. The amount of water used in the water washing treatment or stabilization treatment is generally 20 L or less and the amount of water supplied may be 3 L or less per 1 mof the photosensitive material. The photosensitive material may be washed with storage water thus the water amount supplied may be 0. Therefore the treatment can be carried out without water wasting and piping for an automatic processing can be dispensed with. The multistage countercurrent method for example using two or three stages has long been known as a method for reducing the washing water amount supplied. By using the multistage countercurrent method in the producing method according to the present invention the fixed photosensitive material is successively treated in the appropriate order with the treating liquid that is not contaminated with the fixer so that the water washing treatment can be carried out more efficiently. In the case of using only a small amount of water in the treatment it is further preferable to use a washing bath with a squeeze roller or a crossover roller described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 63 18350 and 62 287252 etc. Such a treatment using a small amount of water may be disadvantageous in high impact on environment and thus an oxidant or filtration may be used to reduce the impact. Further the treatment may be carried out such that an antifungal treated water is introduced into a water washing bath or a stabilization bath according to the above treatment and the whole or part of the overflow liquid from the bath is utilized for the fixing treatment liquid in the previous treatment as described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 60 235133. Furthermore a water soluble surfactant or a defoaming agent may be added to the treatment liquid to prevent water bubble unevenness which is easily caused in the treatment using a small amount of water and or to prevent a treatment component attached to the squeeze roller from being transferred to the treated film.

In the water washing treatment or stabilization treatment a dye adsorbent described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 63 163456 may be disposed in the water washing bath to prevent contamination by a dye eluted from the photosensitive material. In the stabilization treatment subsequent to the water washing treatment a bath containing a compound described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2 201357 2 132435 1 102553 and 46 44446 may be used as a final bath for the photosensitive material. In this case an ammonium compound a compound of a metal such as Bi or Al a fluorescent whitening agent a chelating agent a film pH regulator a film hardening agent a disinfecting agent a fungicide an alkanolamine a surfactant etc. may be added to the bath if necessary. The water used in the water washing or stabilization treatment may be a tap water and is preferably a deionized water or a water sterilized with a halogen an ultraviolet germicidal lamp an oxidant such as ozone hydrogen peroxide or a chlorate salt etc. Further the washing water may contain a compound described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 4 39652 and 5 241309. In the water washing or stabilization treatment the bath temperature and the treatment time are preferably 0 C. to 50 C. and 5 seconds to 2 minutes respectively.

In this embodiment the treatment liquids such as the developer and the fixer are preferably stored in a packaging material with low oxygen permeability as described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 61 73147. In the case of using a small amount of the treatment liquid evaporation and air oxidation of the liquid is preferably prevented by reducing the contact area between the liquid and air. A roller transport type automatic processor is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 025 779 and 3 545 971 etc. and it is herein referred to as a roller transport type processor. In general the roller transport type processor preferably conducts the four steps of development fixation water washing and drying. Also in this embodiment the roller transport type processor most preferably conducts the four steps though it may conduct another step such as a quenching step. The four steps may include the stabilization step instead of the water washing step.

In the above steps the components of the developer or the fixer other than water may be supplied in the solid state and may be dissolved in water and then used as the developer or fixer. Such a treatment agent is referred to as a solid treatment agent. The solid treatment agent may be in a form of powder tablet granule aggregate or paste. The treatment agent is preferably in a tablet form or in a form described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 61 259921. The tablet may be prepared by a common method described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 51 61837 54 155038 and 52 88025 UK Patent No. 1 213 808 etc. The granule treatment agent may be prepared by a common method described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2 109042 2 109043 3 39735 and 3 39739 etc. The powder treatment agent may be prepared by a common method described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 54 133332 UK Patent Nos. 725 892 and 729 862 German Patent No. 3 733 861 etc.

The bulk density of the solid treatment agent is preferably 0.5 to 6.0 g cm particularly preferably 1.0 to 5.0 g cm in view of the solubility.

The solid treatment agent may be prepared such that at least two layers of granular components reactive with each other are separated by at least one intermediate layer of a substance unreactive with the reactive components the layer stack is wrapped in a packaging material capable of vacuum packaging and gas in the material is removed to seal the material. The term unreactive used herein means that when the substance is physically in contact with the reactive component they are reacted not at all or only slightly under ordinary conditions in the package. The unreactive substance may be any substance as long as it is inactive under the condition where the two reactive components are used for the purpose intended not to mention a substance unreactive with the two reactive components. The unreactive substance is used together with the two reactive components. For example though hydroquinone and sodium hydroxide are reacted when they are in direct contact with each other in the developer they can be stored in the vacuum packaging material for a long period by disposing a separator layer of sodium sulfite etc. therebetween. Further hydroquinone etc. may be formed into a briquette to reduce the contact area with sodium hydroxide thereby improving the storage stability. A bag composed of an inactive plastic film or an inactive laminate of a plastic substance and a metal foil may be used as the vacuum packaging material.

The ratio of the mass of the metallic silver contained in the exposed area after the development treatment to the mass of silver contained in this area before the exposure is preferably 50 by mass or more more preferably 80 by mass or more. When the ratio is 50 by mass or more a high conductivity can be preferably achieved.

In this embodiment a tone obtained by the development treatment is preferably more than 4.0 though not particularly restrictive. When the tone after the development treatment is more than 4.0 the conductivity of a conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining high transmittance of the light transmittable portion. For example the tone of 4.0 or more can be achieved by the above mentioned doping with rhodium or iridium ion.

In this embodiment to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the exposure and development conductive metal particles are deposited on the metallic silver portion by a physical development and or a plating treatment. The conductive metal particles can be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one or both of the physical development and the plating treatment in the present invention. The metallic silver portion on which the conductive metal is deposited by the physical development and or the plating treatment is referred to as the conductive metal portion.

In this embodiment the physical development is such a process that a metal ion such as a silver ion is reduced by a reducing agent whereby the metal particles are deposited on a nucleus of a metal or a metal compound. Such a physical development has been used in the fields of instant B W film instant slide film printing plate production etc. and the technologies can be used in the present invention.

The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.

In this embodiment the plating treatment may contain electroless plating such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating electrolytic plating or a combination thereof. Known electroless plating technologies for printed circuit boards etc. may be used in the electroless plating in this embodiment. The electroless plating is preferably electroless copper plating.

Examples of chemical species contained in the electroless copper plating solution include copper sulfate copper chloride and the like reducing agents such as formalin and glyoxylic acid ligands capable of coordinating to copper such as EDTA and triethanolamine and additives for stabilizing the bath or improving smoothness of a plated film such as polyethylene glycol yellow prussiate of potash and bipyridine.

The electrolytic plating exhibits a higher electrodeposition rate and a more excellent production efficiency and has more choices of metals to be electrodeposited as compared with the electroless plating and the physical development. Thus for the purpose of applying the metal layer onto the developed silver to increase the conductivity of the conductive metal portion the electrolytic plating is particularly preferred in this embodiment. The electrolytic plating may be carried out using any method appropriately selected from the methods known in the fields of metal processing printed wiring etc. as long as the electrodeposition onto the developed silver can be achieved.

The electrolytic plating is preferably electrolytic copper plating. A copper sulfate bath a copper pyrophosphate bath etc. may be used as an electrolytic copper plating bath in the electrolytic copper plating.

In this embodiment the plating treatment may be carried out at a low plating rate or a high plating rate of 5 m hr or more. Various additives such as the ligand e.g. EDTA may be added to the plating solution to increase the stability of the solution.

In this embodiment the metallic silver portion formed by the development treatment and the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development and or the plating treatment are preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example in a case where a metal is slightly deposited on the light transmittable portion the metal can be removed by the oxidation treatment so that the transmittance of the light transmittable portion can be increased to approximately 100 .

The oxidation treatment may be carried out by a known method using an oxidant such as Fe III ion. The oxidation treatment may be carried out after the exposure and development treatments of the emulsion layer or after the physical development or the plating treatment and may be carried out after the development treatment and after the physical development or plating treatment respectively.

In this embodiment the metallic silver portion may be treated with a Pd containing solution after the exposure and development treatments. The Pd may be in the state of divalent palladium ion or metal palladium. The electroless plating or the physical development can be accelerated by this treatment.

In the case of using the conductive metal portion according to this embodiment for the light transmittable electromagnetic shielding material the metal line pattern preferably has a geometric shape of a combination of triangle e.g. equilateral triangle isosceles triangle right triangle quadrangle e.g. square rectangle rhombus parallelogram trapezoid regular n gon e.g. regular hexagon regular octagon circle ellipse star etc. The mesh pattern more preferably has a mesh shape containing the geometric shape. From the viewpoint of EMI shielding property the triangular shape is most effective. From the viewpoint of visible light transmittance a shape of regular n gon with larger n is more effective. As the value n is increased the aperture ratio and the visible light transmittance are advantageously increased assuming that every shape has the same line width. In the present invention the pattern of the moire preventing parts is formed in the vicinity of the intersections of the line pattern in addition to the above mentioned line pattern.

In the light transmittable electromagnetic shielding material the wire width of the conductive metal portion is 1 to 40 m preferably 5 to 30 m most preferably 10 to 25 m. The wire distance of the mesh pattern is preferably 50 to 500 m more preferably 200 to 400 m most preferably 250 to 350 m. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a wire width of more than 20 m for the purpose of ground connection etc.

In this embodiment the aperture ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85 or more more preferably 90 or more most preferably 95 or more in view of the visible light transmittance. The aperture ratio is a ratio of the light transmittable portions not having the metal forming the composite mesh pattern with respect to the whole area. For example a square lattice mesh having a wire width of 15 m and a pitch of 300 m has an aperture ratio of 90 .

In this embodiment the light transmittable portion is a portion having light transmittance other than the conductive metal portion in the electromagnetic shielding film. The transmittance of the light transmittable portion which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the support is 90 or more preferably 95 or more more preferably 97 or more further preferably 98 or more most preferably 99 or more.

In this embodiment it is preferred that the mesh pattern has a continuous structure with a length of 3 m or more for improving the productivity of the electromagnetic shielding film . As the length of the continuous structure of the mesh pattern is increased the productivity can be more improved and the loss of producing an optical filter material can be reduced. The long roll of the composite mesh pattern according to this embodiment having the moire preventing parts in the opening portions may be printing exposed by the surface exposure method of irradiating the roll with a uniform light through a patterned mask or the scanning exposure method of irradiating the roll with a laser beam while transporting as described above.

The length of the mesh pattern to be continuously printed is preferably 2000 m or less because when the mesh pattern is fine the roll becomes disadvantageous in large diameter heavy weight and high pressure is applied to the roll center to cause adhesion or deformation etc. The length is more preferably 100 to 1000 m further preferably 200 to 800 m most preferably 300 to 500 m.

For a similar reason the thickness of the transparent support is preferably 200 m or less more preferably 20 to 180 m most preferably 50 to 120 m.

In this embodiment the mesh pattern may be a so called lattice pattern containing crossed linear fine wires. The adjacent wires are parallel to each other within an error of plus or minus 2 .

The scanning with the optical beam is preferably carried out using light sources arranged on a line in a direction substantially perpendicular to the transporting direction or using a rotary polygon mirror. In this case the optical beam has to undergo binary or more intensity modulation and dots are continuously formed into a line pattern. Because each fine wire comprises continuous dots a fine 1 dot wire has a steplike shape. The width of each fine wire is a length in the narrowest part.

In this embodiment the composite mesh pattern is tilted preferably at 30 to 60 more preferably at 40 to 50 most preferably at 43 to 47 against the transporting direction. In general it is difficult to prepare a mask for tilting the mesh pattern at about 45 against the frame and this is likely to result in uneven pattern or increased cost. In contrast in the present method the pattern unevenness is rather reduced at the tilt angle of around 45 . Thus the present invention is more effective in the case of using the method as compared with the case of using masking exposure photolithography or screen printing.

In the electromagnetic shielding film of the present invention the thickness of the transparent support is preferably 5 to 200 m more preferably 30 to 150 m. When the thickness is within the range a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained and the film can be easily handled.

The thickness of the metallic silver portion formed on the transparent support before the physical development and or the plating treatment can be appropriately selected by controlling the amount of a silver salt containing layer coating applied to the transparent support . The thickness of the metallic silver portion is preferably 30 m or less more preferably 20 m or less further preferably 0.01 to 9 m most preferably 0.05 to 5 m. The metallic silver portion preferably has a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. In a case where the metallic silver portion has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers when the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities for sensing different wavelengths different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths. The electromagnetic shielding film having such a patterned multilayer metallic silver portion can be used as a high density printed circuit board.

In the case of using the film as an electromagnetic shielding material for a display the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced the viewing angle of the display is increased. Further in the case of using the film as a conductive wiring material the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness to increase the density. In view of these points the thickness of the layer of the conductive metal in the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 m more preferably at least 0.1 m and less than 5 m further preferably at least 0.1 m and less than 3 m.

In this embodiment the thickness of the metallic silver portion can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt containing layer and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development and or the plating treatment whereby an electromagnetic shielding film having a thickness of less than 5 m preferably less than 3 m can be easily produced.

In conventional etching methods most of thin metal films must be removed and discarded by etching. In contrast in this embodiment the pattern containing only a minimum amount of the conductive metal can be formed on the transparent support . Thus only the minimal amount of the metal is required so that production costs and metal waste amount can be reduced.

When the electromagnetic shielding film according to this embodiment is incorporated in an optical filter a liquid crystal display board a plasma display panel another image display flat panel an imaging semiconductor integrated circuit such as a CCD or the like the electromagnetic shielding film may be bonded thereto by an adhesive layer.

It is preferred that the refractive index difference between the transparent substrate such as a plastic film and an adhesive used in the adhesive layer is reduced to prevent lowering of the visible light transmittance. Thus the adhesive preferably has a refractive index of 1.40 to 1.70 to prevent the lowering of the visible light transmittance.

The adhesive is preferably capable of being fluidized by applying heat or pressure and particularly preferably capable of being fluidized by heating at 200 C. or lower or by pressing at 1 kgf cmor more. In this case the electromagnetic shielding film according to the embodiment which has the adhesive layer and the conductive layer embedded therein can be bonded to a body of a display a plastic plate etc. by fluidizing the adhesive layer. Since the adhesive can be fluidized the electromagnetic shielding film can be easily bonded to the body by a lamination or pressing method particularly by a pressing method even when the body has a curved surface or a complicated shape. From this point the adhesive preferably has a softening temperature of 200 C. or lower. The electromagnetic shielding film is generally used at 80 C. or lower and thus the softening temperature of the adhesive layer is preferably 80 C. or higher and is most preferably 80 C. to 120 C. in view of workability. The softening temperature is a temperature at which the viscosity becomes 10poise or less and the adhesive is generally fluidized within about 1 to 10 seconds at the temperature.

Typical examples of such adhesives that can be fluidized by applying heat or pressure include thermoplastic resins. Examples of the thermoplastic resins include natural rubbers refractive index n 1.52 di ene polymers such as polyisoprenes n 1.521 poly 1 2 butadienes n 1.50 polyisobutenes n 1.505 to 1.51 polybutenes n 1.513 poly 2 heptyl 1 3 butadienes n 1.50 poly 2 t butyl 1 3 butadienes n 1.506 and poly 1 3 butadienes n 1.515 polyethers such as polyoxyethylenes n 1.456 polyoxypropylenes n 1.450 polyvinyl ethyl ethers n 1.454 polyvinyl hexyl ethers n 1.459 and polyvinyl butyl ethers n 1.456 polyesters such as polyvinyl acetates n 1.467 and polyvinyl propionates n 1.467 polyurethanes n 1.5 to 1.6 ethylcelluloses n 1.479 polyvinyl chlorides n 1.54 to 1.55 polyacrylonitriles n 1.52 polymethacrylonitriles n 1.52 polysulfones n 1.633 polysulfides n 1.6 phenoxy resins n 1.5 to 1.6 and poly meth acrylates such as polyethyl acrylates n 1.469 polybutyl acrylates n 1.466 poly 2 ethylhexyl acrylates n 1.463 poly t butyl acrylates n 1.464 poly 3 ethoxypropyl acrylates n 1.465 polyoxycarbonyltetramethylenes n 1.465 polymethyl acrylates n 1.472 to 1.480 polyisopropyl methacrylates n 1.473 polydodecyl methacrylates n 1.474 polytetradecyl methacrylates n 1.475 poly n propyl methacrylates n 1.484 poly 3 3 5 trimethylcyclohexyl methacrylates n 1.484 polyethyl methacrylates n 1.485 poly 2 nitro 2 methylpropyl methacrylates n 1.487 poly 1 1 diethylpropyl methacrylates n 1.489 and polymethyl methacrylates n 1.489 . Two or more of these acrylic polymers may be copolymerized or blended if necessary.

The copolymer resins of the acrylic resins including epoxy acrylates n 1.48 to 1.60 urethane acrylates n 1.5 to 1.6 polyether acrylates n 1.48 to 1.49 and polyester acrylates n 1.48 to 1.54 may be used as the adhesive. The urethane acrylates epoxy acrylates and polyether acrylates are particularly excellent in adhesiveness. The epoxy acrylates include meth acrylic acid adducts of 1 6 hexanediol diglycidyl ether neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether allylalcohol diglycidyl ether resorcinol diglycidyl ether diglycidyl adipate diglycidyl phthalate polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether glycerin triglycidyl ether pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether sorbitol tetraglycidyl ether etc. Polymers having a hydroxyl group in the molecule such as the epoxy acryaltes are effective for improving the adhesion property. Two or more of these copolymer resins may be used in combination if necessary. The softening temperature of the adhesive polymer is preferably 200 C. or lower more preferably 150 C. or lower in view of handling. The electromagnetic shielding film is generally used at 80 C. or lower and the softening temperature of the adhesive layer is most preferably 80 C. to 120 C. in view of workability. The weight average molecular weight of the polymer is preferably 500 or more. In the present invention the weight average molecular weight is obtained by using a calibration curve of a polystyrene standard in a gel permeation chromatography. When the molecular weight is less than 500 the adhesive composition is poor in cohesive force and thus the adhesiveness may be deteriorated. In this embodiment the adhesive may contain an additive such as a diluent a plasticizer an antioxidant a filler a coloring agent an ultraviolet absorber or a tackifier if necessary. The adhesive layer preferably has a thickness of 10 to 80 m and particularly preferably has a thickness of 20 to 50 m greater than that of the conductive layer.

The refractive index difference between the transparent plastic substrate and an adhesive for coating the geometric shape pattern is 0.14 or less. In a case where the conductive material is stacked on a transparent plastic substrate with an adhesion layer disposed in between the refractive index difference between the adhesion layer and an adhesive for coating the geometric shape pattern is 0.14 or less. When the refractive index difference between the transparent plastic substrate and the adhesive or between the adhesive and the adhesion layer is large the visible light transmittance is reduced. When the refractive index difference is 0.14 or less the reduction in the visible light transmittance is small. In the case of using a polyethylene terephthalate refractive index n 1.575 for the transparent plastic substrate examples of satisfactory materials for the adhesive include epoxy resins having a refractive index of 1.55 to 1.60 such as bisphenol A epoxy resins bisphenol F epoxy resins tetrahydroxyphenylmethane epoxy resins novolac epoxy resins resorcin epoxy resins polyalcohol or polyglycol epoxy resins polyolefin epoxy resins alicyclic epoxy resins and halogenated bisphenol epoxy resins. Examples of the materials other than the epoxy resins include natural rubbers n 1.52 di ene polymers such as polyisoprenes n 1.521 poly 1 2 butadienes n 1.50 polyisobutenes n 1.505 to 1.51 polybutenes n 1.5125 poly 2 heptyl 1 3 butadienes n 1.50 poly 2 t butyl 1 3 butadienes n 1.506 and poly 1 3 butadienes n 1.515 polyethers such as polyoxyethylenes n 1.4563 polyoxypropylenes n 1.4495 polyvinyl ethyl ethers n 1.454 polyvinyl hexyl ethers n 1.4591 and polyvinyl butyl ethers n 1.4563 polyesters such as polyvinyl acetates n 1.4665 and polyvinyl propionates n 1.4665 polyurethanes n 1.5 to 1.6 ethylcelluloses n 1.479 polyvinyl chlorides n 1.54 to 1.55 polyacrylonitriles n 1.52 polymethacrylonitriles n 1.52 polysulfones n 1.633 polysulfides n 1.6 and phenoxy resins n 1.5 to 1.6 . These materials show a preferred visible light transmittance.

In the case of using an acrylic resin for the transparent plastic substrate examples of the materials for the adhesive other than the above resins include poly meth acrylates such as polyethyl acrylates n 1.4685 polybutyl acrylates n 1.466 poly 2 ethylhexyl acrylates n 1.463 poly t butyl acrylates n 1.4638 poly 3 ethoxypropyl acrylates n 1.465 polyoxycarbonyl tetramethacrylates n 1.465 polymethyl acrylates n 1.472 to 1.480 polyisopropyl methacrylates n 1.4728 polydodecyl methacrylates n 1.474 polytetradecyl methacrylates n 1.4746 poly n propyl methacrylates n 1.484 poly 3 3 5 trimethylcyclohexyl methacrylates n 1.484 polyethyl methacrylates n 1.485 poly 2 nitro 2 methylpropyl methacrylates n 1.4868 polytetracarbanyl methacrylates n 1.4889 poly 1 1 diethylpropyl methacrylates n 1.4889 and polymethyl methacrylates n 1.4893 . Two or more of these acrylic polymers may be copolymerized or blended if necessary.

The copolymer resins of the acrylic resins including epoxy acrylates urethane acrylates polyether acrylates and polyester acrylates may be used as the adhesive. The epoxy acrylates and polyether acrylates are particularly excellent in adhesiveness. The epoxy acrylates include meth acrylic acid adducts of 1 6 hexanediol diglycidyl ether neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether allylalcohol diglycidyl ether resorcinol diglycidyl ether diglycidyl adipate diglycidyl phthalate polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether glycerin triglycidyl ether pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether sorbitol tetraglycidyl ether etc. The epoxy acrylate has a hydroxyl group in the molecule and thereby is effective for improving the adhesion property. These copolymer resins may be used in combination of two or more if necessary. The weight average molecular weight of a polymer used as a main component of the adhesive is 1 000 or more. When the molecular weight is less than 1 000 the adhesive composition is poor in cohesive force and thus shows a deteriorated adhesiveness.

Examples of hardening agents used for the adhesive include amines such as triethylenetetramine xylenediamine and diaminodiphenylmethane acid anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride maleic anhydride dodecylsuccinic anhydride pyromellitic anhydride and benzophenonetetracarboxylic anhydride diaminodiphenylsulfone tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol polyamide resins dicyandiamide and ethylmethylimidazole. These hardening agents may be used singly or in combination of two or more. The amount of the cross linking agent is preferably 0.1 to 50 parts by weight more preferably 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the above polymer. When the amount is less than 0.1 parts by weight the hardening of the adhesive is insufficient. When the amount is more than 50 parts by weight the adhesive is excessively cross linked resulting in deterioration in adhesiveness. An additive such as a diluent a plasticizer an antioxidant a filler or a tackifier may be added to a resin composition used as the adhesive in the present invention if necessary. The transparent plastic substrate having the conductive geometric pattern is partly or entirely coated with the adhesive resin composition and the applied composition is dried and thermally hardened to prepare an adhesion film. The adhesion film having the electromagnetic shielding property and light transmittance may be directly bonded to a display of CRT PDP liquid crystal EL etc. by utilizing the adhesiveness thereof. Alternatively the adhesion film may be bonded to a plate or sheet such as an acrylic plate or a glass plate and then used in the display. Further the adhesion film may be used in a window or casing of a measuring apparatus a measuring instrument or a producing apparatus generating an electromagnetic wave to observe the inside thereof. Furthermore the adhesion film may be used in a window of an automobile or a building which may be adversely affected by an electromagnetic wave of a radio tower a high tension wire etc. It is preferred that an earth wire is connected to the conductive geometric pattern.

In the transparent plastic substrate an area not having the conductive material may have a rough surface for increasing the adhesion property. Further the back shape of the conductive material may be transferred onto the transparent plastic substrate. Thus a light may be scattered on the surface deteriorating the light transmittance. The scattered reflection on the rough surface can be reduced to the minimum by flatly coating the surface with a resin having a refractive index similar to that of the transparent plastic substrate. The conductive geometric pattern on the transparent plastic substrate has a remarkably small line width and thus cannot be visually observed by naked eye. Further the conductive geometric pattern has a sufficiently large pitch and thus the film is light transmittable apparently. Furthermore the pitch of the geometric pattern is sufficiently small as compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave to be shielded and therefore the film can show an excellent shielding property.

As described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2003 188576 in a case where a film of a highly thermal adhesive resin such as an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin or an ionomer resin or a stack of the film and another resin film is used as the transparent substrate a metal foil is generally stacked on the transparent substrate by a dry lamination method using an adhesive layer etc. though they can be stacked without the adhesive layer. Examples of adhesives for the adhesive layer include acrylic resins polyester resins polyurethane resins polyvinyl alcohol resins vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer resins and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resins and further include thermosetting resins and ionizing radiation hardening resins such as ultraviolet curing resins and electron beam curing resins.

In general the surface of a display is composed of a glass plate and the transparent plastic film is bonded to the glass plate by a tacky material. When an air bubble is generated in the adhesion surface or the film is peeled from the glass plate images may be distorted or a color different from the desired one may be observed disadvantageously. The air bubble generation and the peeling of the film are caused when the tacky material is separated from the plastic film or the glass plate. The tacky material is separated at an adhesion surface of the adhesive and the plastic film or the glass plate whichever has weaker adhesiveness. Thus the tacky material needs to have a high adhesiveness to both the plastic film and the glass plate at high temperature. Specifically the adhesion forces between the tacky material layer and the transparent plastic film and between the tacky material layer and the glass plate are preferably 10 g cm or more more preferably 30 g cm or more at 80 C. The adhesion force may be more than 2000 g cm unless the bonding procedure becomes difficult. An interleaf separator may be formed on an area of the tacky material layer not bonded to the transparent plastic film to prevent the area from bonding to another component.

The tacky material is preferably transparent. Specifically the total light transmittance of the tacky material is preferably 70 or more more preferably 80 or more most preferably 85 to 92 . Further the tacky material is preferably low in haze. Specifically the haze of the tacky material is preferably 0 to 3 more preferably 0 to 1.5 . It is preferred that the tacky material used in the present invention is colorless from the viewpoint of not changing the displayed original color. Even when the resin for the tacky material is colored a thinner tacky material layer can be substantially colorless. Further the tacky material may be purposefully colored as described hereinafter.

Examples of the tacky materials having the above property include acrylic resins olefin resins vinyl acetate resins acrylic copolymer resins urethane resins epoxy resins vinylidene chloride resins vinyl chloride resins ethylene vinyl acetate resins polyamide resins and polyester resins. Among them the acrylic resins are preferred. The tackiness of the resin can be improved by reducing the amount of a cross linking agent by adding a tackifier by modifying an end group of the molecule etc. in the polymerization synthesis of the tacky material. Further the adhesion property of the tacky material can be improved by modifying the surface to be bonded of the transparent plastic film or the glass plate. The surface may be modified by a physical treatment such as a corona discharge treatment or a plasma glow treatment or by forming an underlayer for improving the adhesion property.

It is preferred that the tacky material layer has a thickness of about 5 to 50 m from the viewpoints of the light transmittance colorless property and handling property. In the case of using an adhesive for the tacky material layer the thickness of the adhesive may be reduced within the above range specifically may be 1 to 20 m. The thickness may be increased above the range as long as the layer does not change the original color of the display and has a sufficient light transmittance.

A peelable protective film may be formed on the electromagnetic shielding film according to this embodiment.

The protective film is not necessarily disposed on the both surface of the electromagnetic shielding film . The protective film may be used such that as shown in of Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2003 188576 a protective film is disposed only on a mesh metal foil of a stack and is not disposed on a transparent substrate film . Alternatively the protective film may be used such that as shown in of the patent publication a protective film is disposed only on a transparent substrate film of a stack and is not disposed on a metal foil . The numerals in parentheses represent referential signs of the above patent publication in this paragraph and the following several paragraphs.

The layer structure and the production of a stack in the electromagnetic shielding film will be described below with reference to to of the above patent publication. The stack contains at least the transparent support and a light transmittable electromagnetic shielding layer having the mesh pattern with densely arranged opening portions . The process of stacking the protective film the protective film and or the protective film will be described after the production of the stack is described.

First as shown in of the above patent publication a transparent substrate film the transparent support and a metal foil are stacked with an adhesion layer disposed therebetween to prepare a stack. The transparent substrate film may be composed of an acrylic resin a polycarbonate resin a polypropylene resin a polyethylene resin a polystyrene resin a polyester resin a cellulose resin a polysulfone resin or a polyvinyl chloride resin. In general the transparent substrate film is preferably composed of a polyester resin excellent in mechanical strength and light transmittance such as a polyethylene terephthalate resin. The thickness of the transparent substrate film is preferably about 50 to 200 m and may be above this range in view of the mechanical strength and curving resistance though not particularly restrictive. The thickness may be smaller than the range in the case of stacking the electromagnetic shielding sheet the electromagnetic shielding film on another transparent substrate. One or both of the surfaces of the transparent substrate film may be corona discharge treated or covered with an easy adhesion layer if necessary.

As shown in of the above patent publication the electromagnetic shielding sheet is used such that the above stack is placed on a substrate with an infrared cutting filter layer or the like disposed therebetween and a sheet for strengthening the outermost surface improving the antireflection property or improving the antifouling property is placed on the both surfaces of the resultant stack. The protective film has to be peeled off before the further stacking process and thus the protective film on the metal foil is preferably peelable.

The peeling resistance of the protective film on the metal foil is preferably 5 mN 25 mm width to 5 N 25 mm width more preferably 10 to 100 mN 25 mm width. When the peeling resistance is less than the lower limit the protective film can be peeled off too easily by handling or indeliberate contact. On the other hand when the peeling resistance is more than the upper limit a large force is required to peel the protective film. Further when the protective film is peeled also the mesh metal foil may be disadvantageously separated from the transparent substrate film or the adhesive layer .

In the electromagnetic shielding sheet the mesh metal foil may be placed on the transparent substrate film with the adhesive layer therebetween to form the stack and the stack may further contain a black layer. The protective film may be disposed on the lower surface i.e. the side facing the transparent substrate film of the stack to prevent the lower surface of the transparent substrate film from being scratched by handling or indeliberate contact or to prevent the uncovered surface of the transparent substrate film from being contaminated or degraded in the steps of forming and etching a resist layer on the metal foil particularly in the etching step.

The protective film has to be peeled off before the further stacking process and thus also the protective film on the transparent substrate film is preferably peelable. The peeling resistance of the protective film on the transparent substrate film is preferably 5 mN 25 mm width to 5 N 25 mm width more preferably 10 to 100 mN 25 mm width. When the peeling resistance is less than the lower limit the protective film can be peeled off too easily by handling or indeliberate contact. On the other hand when the peeling resistance is more than the upper limit a large force is required to peel the protective film.

It is preferred that the protective film on the transparent substrate film is stable under etching conditions for example in an etching liquid at 50 C. It is particularly preferred that the protective film is not degraded by an alkali component in the etching liquid when immersed therein for several minutes. It is also preferred that the protective film is stable under dry etching conditions at about 100 C. In a case where the stack is dip coated immersion coated with a photosensitive resin layer the coating liquid is attached to the opposite surface of the stack too. In this case it is preferred that the protective film is sufficiently bonded to the photosensitive resin to prevent the photosensitive resin from being peeled off and suspended in an etching liquid during etching. Further it is also preferred that the protective film has resistance against contamination by an etching liquid containing iron chloride copper chloride etc. or against corrosion or contamination by a resist remover such as an alkali liquid.

Preferred examples of materials for the protective film include polyolefin resins such as polyethylene resins and polypropylene resins polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate resins polycarbonate resins and acrylic resins. From the above described viewpoints at least a surface of the protective film which is used as the outermost surface of the stack is preferably corona discharge treated or coated with an easy adhesion layer.

The above protective film materials and tacky materials for the protective film on the transparent substrate can be used for the protective film on the metal foil. Thus the both protective films may be the same or different.

A black layer may be formed by a blackening treatment on the transparent substrate film side surface of the metal foil as shown in a structural view of Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2003 188576 etc. The black layer can exhibit an antirust property and an antireflection property. For example the black layer may be formed by Co Cu alloy plating and can function to prevent reflection on the surface of the metal foil . The black layer may be subjected to an antirust treatment such as a chromate treatment. In the chromate treatment the metal foil is immersed in a solution containing a chromate or dichromate salt as a main component and then dried to form an antirust layer. One or both sides of the metal foil may be chromate treated depending on the intended use. Commercially available chromate treated copper foils and the like may be used in the present invention. In the case of using a metal foil not blackened beforehand the metal foil may be subjected to the blackening treatment in any one of the following steps. The black layer may be formed such that a photosensitive resin layer usable as a resist layer is prepared using a black colored composition and the resist layer is not removed after the etching. Further the black layer may be formed by a plating method.

Another example of the structure containing the black layer is described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 11 266095. In the above electromagnetic shielding plate the black layer such as a first black layer or a second black layer may be formed as mentioned below on a conductive mesh pattern P formed by crossing transverse direction lines x and longitudinal direction lines y . In this embodiment the main subject of the mesh pattern may be formed by one of the metal plating method and the etching method. The method and material for forming the black layer such as the first black layer or the second black layer may be selected depending on the method for forming the mesh pattern . Thus in the case of forming the conductive pattern P by the metal plating method on the black layer such as the first black layer or the second black layer the black layer has to be conductive and capable of being plated with a metal. On the other hand in the case of forming the black layer in the final step by the etching method the electrodeposition method or the like the black layer can be nonconductive. The conductive black layer can be formed using a conductive metal compound of nickel Ni zinc Zn copper Cu etc. The nonconductive black layer can be formed using a black high molecular material paste such as a black ink a chemically blackened material such as a material prepared by chemically modifying a surface of a metal plating layer to form a black compound an ionic high molecular electrodeposition material such as an electrodeposition coating material etc. In this embodiment the method for forming the black layer is appropriately selected depending on the production process of the electromagnetic shielding plate etc.

As shown in FIG. 5 of Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 11 266095 the black layer may be formed such that an electrodeposition substrate having a conductive metal substrate and a resist mesh pattern of an insulating film inhibiting electrodeposition is immersed in an electrolytic solution containing a black copper a black nickel etc. and then the substrate is plated by a known electrochemical plating method to form the mesh of the second black layer composed of a black copper layer a black nickel layer etc. In this embodiment the above black plating bath may contain nickel sulfate as a main component. The black plating bath may be a commercially available bath and specific examples thereof include an Sn Ni alloy based black plating bath NOBLOY SNC trade name available from Shimizu Co. Ltd. an Sn Ni alloy based black plating bath NIKKA BLACK trade name available from Nihon Kagaku Sangyo Co. Ltd. and a Cr based black plating bath EBONY CHROME 85 series trade name available from Kinzoku Kagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.

The black plating bath may contain Zn Cu etc. In the present invention as shown in of the above patent publication a conductive mesh pattern having a desired thickness may be stacked and electrodeposited on the second black layer by immersing the electrodeposition substrate having the second black layer in an electrolytic solution of an electromagnetic shielding metal. The material of the conductive mesh pattern is most preferably the above mentioned high conductive metal. The electrolytic metal solution for forming the electrodeposited metal layer may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose from various common low cost electrolytic metal solutions. Cu has been widely used as a low cost high conductive metal. Though another metal may be used in this embodiment Cu is suitable for the purpose of this embodiment.

In this embodiment the mesh pattern may contain a plurality of metal layers. For example because the mesh pattern of Cu is relatively soft and easily scratched a protective layer of a common tough metal such as Ni or Cr may be formed on the mesh pattern to prepare an electrodeposited metal layer having a bilayer structure though not shown in the drawings. The mesh pattern may be subjected to a surface chemical conversion treatment. Specifically for example in the case of using copper Cu for the mesh pattern the Cu surface is treated with a hydrogen sulfide HS solution and blackened to copper sulfide CuS so that the electrodeposited metal layer surface of the mesh pattern is blackened to form the first black layer . Thus the resultant mesh pattern has a multilayer structure of the second black layer the conductive pattern layer and the first black layer formed in this order. A blackening agent for the copper surface used in this embodiment can be easily prepared using a sulfide or a sulfide compound and can be selected from various commercially available products. Examples thereof include COPPER BLACK CuO COPPER BLACK CuS and selenium based COPPER BLACK No. 65 trade names available from Isolate Kagaku Kenkyusho and EBONOL C SPECIAL trade name available from Meltex Inc.

In the electromagnetic shielding plate an etching resist pattern may be removed or maintained. After the etching resist pattern is removed the surface of the remaining conductive metal layer may be subjected to a blackening treatment. The blackening treatment may contain a known blackening process such as a plating process using black copper Cu black nickel Ni etc. or a chemical blackening process.

The optical filter according to this embodiment may have a functional film containing a composite functional layer in addition to the electromagnetic shielding film.

In general the viewability of a display screen is reduced due to reflection of a luminaire etc. Thus the functional film may have an antireflection AR function to prevent the reflection of an external light an antiglare AG function to prevent the reflection of a mirror image or an antireflection antiglare ARAG function containing both the properties. When the surface of the optical filter has a low visible light reflectance the contrast or the like can be improved while preventing the mirror image.

The functional film with the antireflection function has an antireflection layer. Specifically the antireflection layer may comprise a thin single layer having a wavelength optical thickness and a low refractive index of 1.5 or less preferably 1.4 or less in the visible region composed of a transparent fluorine containing polymer resin magnesium fluoride a silicone resin silicon oxide or the like. Further the antireflection layer may comprise a stack of 2 or more thin layers having different refractive indices and each thin layer may contain an inorganic compound such as an oxide fluoride silicide nitride or sulfide of a metal or an organic compound such as a silicone resin an acrylic resin or a fluorine resin. The antireflection layer is not limited to the examples. In the functional film with the antireflection function the visible light reflectance of the surface is 2 or less preferably 1.3 or less more preferably 0.8 or less.

The functional film with the antiglare function has an antiglare layer transparent to visible light and the antiglare layer has a small surface roughness of about 0.1 to 10 m. Specifically the antiglare layer may be prepared by the steps of dispersing particles of an inorganic or organic compound such as a silica an organic silicon compound a melamine compound or an acrylic compound in a heat or light hardening resin such as an acrylic resin a silicone resin a melamine resin a urethane resin an alkyd resin or a fluorine resin to obtain an ink applying the ink to a base and hardening the applied ink. The particles have an average particle diameter of 1 to 40 m. Alternatively the antiglare layer may be prepared by the steps of applying the heat or light hardening resin to the base and hardening the resin while pressing a mold having a desired glossiness or surface roughness. The preparation of the antiglare layer is not limited to these methods. The haze of the functional film with the antiglare function is 0.5 to 20 preferably 1 to 10 . Too small haze results in an insufficient antiglare function and too large haze tends to result in a low sharpness of an image transmitted therethrough.

A hard coating layer having a hard coating function is preferably contained in the functional film to improve the abrasion resistance of the optical filter. The material and formation method of the hard coating layer are not particularly limited and examples of the materials include heat or light hardening resins such as acrylic resins silicone resins melamine resins urethane resins alkyd resins and fluorine resins. The hard coating layer has a thickness of about 1 to 50 m. The surface hardness of the functional hard coating layer is H or more preferably 2H or more more preferably 3H or more by the pencil hardness according to JIS K 5400. It is preferred that the antireflection layer and or the antiglare layer are formed on the hard coating layer to obtain a functional film having the antireflection function and or the antiglare function in addition to the abrasion resistance.

Due to static charge in the optical filter dust is easily attached to the optical filter and a person is often electrically shocked by electric discharged from touches the optical filter being touched by the person. Therefore an antistatic treatment is carried out in some cases. Thus the functional film may be conductive and have an antistatic function to prevent the static charge. In this case the conductivity may be such that the surface resistance is about 10 sq or less. The functional film may be made conductive by a method of adding an antistatic agent to the film or by a method of forming a conductive layer in the film etc. Specific examples of the antistatic agents include PELESTAT trade name available from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. and ELECTROSTRIPPER trade name available from Kao Corporation . Examples of the conductive layers include known transparent conductive layers composed of ITO etc. and conductive layers composed of a dispersion of conductive ultrafine particles of ITO tin oxide etc. It is preferred that the hard coating layer the antireflection layer or the antiglare layer contains the conductive layer or the conductive fine particles.

It is preferred that the surface of the functional film has an antifouling function so that attachment of stain such as fingermark can be prevented or attached stain can be easily removed. Examples of materials having the antifouling function include those non wettable by water and or oil such as fluorine compounds and silicon compounds. Specifically for example OPTOOL trade name available from Daikin Industries Ltd. may be used as the fluorine based antifouling agent and TAKATA QUANTUM trade name available from NOF Corporation may be used as the silicon compound. It is preferred that the antireflection layer contains a layer having the antifouling function.

The functional film preferably has an ultraviolet cutoff function to prevent deterioration of a dye or a polymer film to be hereinafter described. The functional film having the ultraviolet cutoff function may be prepared by a method of adding an ultraviolet absorber in the polymer film a method of forming an ultraviolet absorbing layer etc.

In a case where the optical filter is used under a temperature and humidity higher than ordinary temperature and humidity the dye to be hereinafter described may be deteriorated by water introduced through the film the water may be aggregated in the tacky material or on the adhesion surface and cause fog in the film and the tackifier in the tacky material may be phase separated and deposited by the water and cause fog in the film. Thus the functional film preferably has a gas barrier function. To prevent the dye deterioration and the fogging it is important to prevent the impregnation of water into a dye containing layer and a tacky material layer. The water vapor permeability of the functional film is preferably 10 g m day or less more preferably 5 g m day or less.

In this embodiment the polymer film the conductive mesh layer the functional film and a transparent molding to be hereinafter described are bonded by a visible light transmittable tacky material or adhesive a first and second light transmittable tacky material layers . Specific examples of the tacky materials and the adhesives the first and second light transmittable tacky material layers include acrylic adhesives silicone adhesives urethane adhesives polyvinyl butyral PVB adhesives ethylene vinyl acetate EVA adhesives polyvinyl ethers saturated amorphous polyesters and melamine resins. The tacky material and the adhesive may be in any state such as a sheet state or a liquid state as long as they have practically sufficient bonding strength. The tacky material is preferably a sheet of a pressure sensitive adhesive. After attaching the tacky material sheet or applying the adhesive the above components are stacked and bonded. The liquid adhesive may be hardened at room temperature or under heating after the application and bonding. The method for applying the adhesive may be selected from bar coating reverse coating gravure coating die coating and roll coating methods etc. depending on the type viscosity amount or the like of the adhesive. The thickness of the layer is not particularly limited and is generally 0.5 to 50 m preferably 1 to 30 m. It is preferred that a surface which the tacky material layer is formed on or bonded to is previously subjected to an easy adhesion treatment such as an easy adhesion coating treatment or a corona discharge treatment to improve the wettability. In the present invention both the visible light transmittable tacky material and adhesive may be referred to as the light transmittable tacky material.

In this embodiment the first light transmittable tacky material layer is used particularly for bonding the functional film to the conductive mesh layer. Above described light transmittable tacky materials may be used also in the first light transmittable tacky material layer. It is important that the thickness of the first light transmittable tacky material layer is sufficient to embed a depression of the conductive mesh layer though any light transmittable tacky material mentioned above can be used. When the first light transmittable tacky material layer is excessively thin as compared with the conductive mesh layer the conductive mesh layer is insufficiently embedded so that a space is formed between the layers. As a result air bubbles are generated in the depression and the resultant display filter has turbidity and insufficient light transmittance. On the other hand when the first light transmittable tacky material layer is excessively thick the production cost is increased and the handling of the material becomes difficult. When the conductive mesh layer has a thickness of d m the thickness of the first light transmittable tacky material layer is preferably within a range of d 2 to d 30 m.

The visible light transmittance of the optical filter is preferably 30 to 85 more preferably 35 to 70 . When the visible light transmittance is less than 30 the luminance is excessively reduced to deteriorate visibility. On the other hand when the visible light transmittance is too high the optical filter cannot act to improve the contrast of a display. In the present invention the visible light transmittance is calculated according to JIS R 3106 from wavelength dependence of transmittance in the visible region.

When the functional film is bonded to the conductive mesh layer using the first light transmittable tacky material layer therebetween air bubbles are generated in the depression and the resultant filter has turbidity and insufficient light transmittability in some cases. In such cases the gas introduced between the components in the bonding step may be removed or solid dissolved in the tacky material by a pressure treatment etc. to remove the fogging and to improve the light transmittability. The pressure treatment may be carried out to the stack of the functional film the first light transmittable tacky material layer the conductive mesh layer the polymer film or to the display filter according to the present embodiment.

The pressure treatment may be carried out using a method of sandwiching the stack between flat plates a method of transporting the stack between nip rolls or a method of introducing the stack in a pressure vessel though the pressurizing method is not particularly limited. The method of introducing the stack in the pressure vessel to apply pressure to the stack is preferred because in this method a pressure can be uniformly applied to the entire stack without pressing unevenness and a plurality of stacks can be treated at the same time. The pressure vessel may be an autoclave.

In the pressure treatment as the pressure is increased the generated air bubbles can be reduced and the treatment time can be shortened. In view of the pressure resistance of the stack and a limit for a pressurizing apparatus used therein the pressure is generally about 0.2 to 2 MPa preferably 0.4 to 1.3 MPa. The pressurizing time depends on various pressurizing conditions and is not particularly limited. As the pressurizing time is increased also the treatment cost is increased. Thus it is preferred that the treatment is carried out for 6 hours or less under appropriate pressurizing conditions. Particularly in the method using the pressure vessel the stack is preferably maintained at the predetermined pressure for about 10 minutes to 3 hours.

In some cases it is preferred that the stack is heated in the pressure treatment. The fluidity of the light transmittable tacky material can be temporarily increased by heating whereby the generated air bubbles can be easily removed or solid dissolved in the tacky material. The heating is generally carried out at about a room temperature to 80 C. in view of the heat resistance of each component of the optical filter though the heating temperature is not particularly limited.

Further the adhesion force of each component in the optical filter can be preferably improved by the pressure treatment or the pressure heating treatment.

In the optical filter according to this embodiment the second light transmittable tacky material layer is formed on a main surface of the polymer film on which the conductive mesh layer is not formed. Above described light transmittable tackiness materials may be used also in the second light transmittable tacky material layer and the material of the layer is not particularly limited. The thickness of the second light transmittable tacky material layer is not particularly limited and is generally 0.5 to 50 m and preferably 1 to 30 m. It is preferred that the surface which the second light transmittable tacky material layer is formed on or bonded to is previously subjected to an easy adhesion treatment such as an easy adhesion coating treatment or a corona discharge treatment to improve the wettability.

A release film may be formed on the second light transmittable tacky material layer. Thus the filter may have a structure containing at least the functional film the first light transmittable tacky material layer the conductive mesh layer the polymer film the second light transmittable tacky material layer the release film. The release film may be formed by coating the tacky material layer side surface of the polymer film with a silicone etc. When the optical filter according to this embodiment is bonded to a main surface of a transparent molding to be hereinafter described or a display surface e.g. a front glass of a plasma display panel the release film is peeled to expose the second light transmittable tacky material layer.

The optical filter according to this embodiment is used mainly for the purpose of shielding an electromagnetic wave from various displays preferably plasma displays.

As described above the plasma display generates a near infrared ray with high intensity. Therefore the optical filter preferably shields not only the electromagnetic wave but also the near infrared ray to the practical level. The transmittance of the optical filter in a wavelength region of 800 to 1000 nm is 25 or less preferably 15 or less more preferably 10 or less. Further the transmitted light color of the optical filter for the plasma display has to be a neutral gray or bluish gray color. This is because in some cases it is necessary to maintain or improve the light emission characteristics and contrast of the plasma display and a white color having color temperature slightly higher than that of a standard white is preferred. Further it is said that a color plasma display is insufficient in color reproducibility due to unnecessary emission from a fluorescent body or a discharged gas and it is preferable to selectively reduce the unnecessary emission. In particular the red color emission spectrum of the display shows several emission peaks over a wavelength region of about 580 to 700 nm and the purity of the red color is deteriorated by a relatively strong emission peak at a short wavelength showing an orangish color. The optical property can be controlled by using a dye. Thus desired optical property can be obtained such that a near infrared absorber is used to cut the near infrared ray and a dye capable of selectively absorbing the unnecessary emission is used to reduce the emission. Further also the color tone of the optical filter can be preferably controlled by using a dye capable of absorbing an appropriate visible light.

The dye may be added such that 1 at least one dye is mixed with a transparent resin to form a polymer film or a resin plate 2 at least one dye is dispersed or dissolved in a high concentration resin liquid containing an organic solvent and a resin or a resin monomer and cast into a polymer film or a resin plate 3 at least one dye is added to a resin binder and an organic solvent to prepare a coating liquid and applied to a polymer film or a resin plate or 4 at least one dye is added to a transparent tacky material. The method of adding the dye can be selected from 1 to 4 but is not limited thereto. In this embodiment the dye may be contained in a substrate a layer such as a coating or a tacky material and may be present on a surface of the substrate or layer.

The dye is not particularly limited and may be a near infrared absorber or a common coloring agent or pigment having a desired absorption wavelength in the visible region. Examples of the dyes include common commercially available organic dyes such as anthraquinone dyes phthalocyanine dyes methine dyes azomethine dyes oxazine dyes immonium dyes azo dyes styryl dyes coumarin dyes porphyrin dyes dibenzofuranone dyes diketopyrrolopyrrole dyes rhodamine dyes xanthene dyes pyrromethene dyes dithiol dyes and diiminium dyes. The type and concentration of the dye are not particularly limited and may be selected depending on the desired absorption wavelength and absorption coefficient of the dye the desired transmission property and transmittance of the optical filter a medium in which the dye is dispersed and the type and thickness of the coating.

The plasma display panel has a high panel surface temperature. Particularly in the case of using the plasma display panel at a high environmental temperature also the optical filter has a high temperature. Thus it is preferred that the dye is heat resistant and is not significantly deteriorated by decomposition or the like at 80 C. Some dyes are insufficient in light resistance in addition to heat resistance. In a case where an ultraviolet or visible ray in a light emitted from the plasma display or an external light causes a deterioration problem it is important to use an ultraviolet absorber containing component or an ultraviolet untransmittable component thereby reducing the deterioration of the dye due to the ultraviolet or to use a dye that is not significantly deteriorated by the ultraviolet or visible ray. Problems caused by heat light humidity or a combination thereof can be solved in the same manner. When the dye is deteriorated the transmission property of the display filter is changed whereby the color tone is changed or the near infrared cutoff function is reduced. Further the solubility and dispersion property of the dye in an appropriate solvent are important for dispersing the dye in a medium or coating. In the present invention two or more dyes having different absorption wavelengths may be contained in one medium or coating and may be contained in two or more media or coatings respectively.

In this embodiment the above methods 1 to 4 for adding the dye may be used for forming at least one of dye containing polymer films dye containing functional films dye containing first and second light transmittable tacky material layers or dye containing light transmittable tacky materials and adhesives for bonding other components in the optical filter.

Generally the dye is liable to be deteriorated by an ultraviolet ray. The optical filter receives an ultraviolet ray contained in an external light such as a solar light under ordinary use conditions. Thus it is preferred that at least a dye containing layer or a layer closer to person which receives the external light more than the dye containing layer has an ultraviolet cutoff function to prevent the deterioration of the dye due to the ultraviolet ray. For example the dye contained in the polymer film is protected against the ultraviolet in the external light when the first light transmittable tacky material layer and or the functional film contain an ultraviolet absorber or an ultraviolet cutoff functional layer. The ultraviolet cutoff function for protecting the dye is 20 or less preferably 10 or less more preferably 5 or less in the transmittance of the ultraviolet wavelength region of less than 380 nm. The ultraviolet cutoff functional layer may be a layer containing an ultraviolet absorber or an inorganic layer capable of reflecting or absorbing the ultraviolet. The ultraviolet absorber may be a known one such as a benzotriazole absorber or a benzophenone absorber. The type and concentration of the ultraviolet absorber are not particularly limited and may be selected depending on the dispersion property or solubility in the medium the absorption wavelength the absorption coefficient the thickness of the medium etc. It is preferred that the layer or film having the ultraviolet cutoff function is poor in absorption in the visible region and thereby does not significantly reduce the visible light transmittance and does not show a color of yellow etc. In a case where the functional film has a dye containing layer a functional layer closer to human than the dye containing layer may have the ultraviolet cutoff function. In a case where the polymer film contains the dye a functional layer closer to human than the polymer film may have the ultraviolet cutting ability.

The dye can be deteriorated when a metal comes into contact therewith. In the case of using such a dye the dye is preferably positioned such that the contact between the dye and the conductive mesh layer is prevented as much as possible. Specifically it is preferred that the functional film the polymer film or the light transmittable tacky material layer D2 contains the dye and it is particularly preferred that the light transmittable tacky material layer D2 contains the dye.

In the optical filter according to this embodiment the polymer film the conductive mesh layer the functional film the first light transmittable tacky material layer and the second light transmittable tacky material layer are disposed in the order of the functional film the first light transmittable tacky material layer the conductive mesh layer the polymer film the second light transmittable tacky material layer. It is preferred that a conductive mesh film containing the conductive mesh layer and the polymer film is bonded to the functional film by the first light transmittable tacky material layer and the second light transmittable tacky material layer is formed on a main surface of the polymer film opposite to the surface having the conductive mesh layer.

The optical filter according to this embodiment is attached to a display such that the functional film faces the operator and the second light transmittable tacky material layer faces the display.

The optical filter according to this embodiment may be used on the front surface of the display such that the optical filter is disposed on a support of a transparent molding to be hereinafter described to form a filter fronted plate or the optical filter is bonded to the display by the second light transmittable tacky material layer. In the former method the optical filter can be relatively easily attached and the transparent support acts to increase the mechanical strength so that the method is suitable for protecting the display. In the latter method the resultant optical filter has small weight and thickness since the support is not used and the reflection on the display surface can be advantageously prevented.

The transparent molding may be a glass plate or a light transmittable plastic plate. The plastic plate is preferred from the viewpoints of mechanical strength lightweight and cracking resistance. The glass plate is hardly deformed by heat and thus is also preferred from the viewpoint of thermal stability. Specifically the plastic plate may be composed of an acrylic resin such as a polymethyl methacrylate PMMA a polycarbonate resin a transparent ABS resin etc. and the material of the plastic plate is not limited thereto. Particularly the PMMA has high light transmittance in a wide wavelength region and high mechanical strength and thereby is preferably used for the plastic plate. The thickness of the plastic plate is not particularly limited and may be such that the plastic plate has mechanical strength and rigidity sufficient for maintaining the flatness without deflection. The thickness of the plastic plate is generally about 1 to 10 mm. The glass plate is preferably composed of a semi tempered or tempered glass which is chemical tempering treated or air cooling tempering treated to improve the mechanical strength. The thickness of the glass plate is not particularly limited and is preferably about 1 to 4 mm in view of the weight. The transparent molding may be subjected to a known pretreatment before bonding the film thereto if necessary. A frame having a color such as a black color may be printed on a portion of the transparent molding corresponding to the periphery of the optical filter.

In the case of using the transparent molding the optical filter may have a structure containing at least the functional film the first light transmittable tacky material layer the conductive mesh layer the polymer film the second light transmittable tacky material layer the transparent molding. Another functional film may be bonded by a light transmittable tacky material layer to a main surface of the transparent molding opposite to the surface to be bonded to the second light transmittable tacky material layer. In this case the functional film and the other functional film may be different in the function and structure. For example the other functional film may have an antireflection function to reduce the reflection on the back surface of the optical filter having the transparent support. Further a functional layer such as an antireflection layer may be formed on the main surface of the transparent molding opposite to the surface to be bonded to the second light transmittable tacky material layer. In this case the optical filter may be attached to the display such that the functional layer faces the operator. As described above it is preferred that the dye containing layer or the outer layer on the side of viewers has the ultraviolet cutoff function.

In general an electromagnetic wave from a device can be shielded by forming a metal layer in a casing of the device or by using a conductive material in the casing. However in the case of a light transmittable device such as a display a window shaped electromagnetic shielding filter having a light transmittable conductive layer such as the optical filter according to this embodiment should be used. The electromagnetic wave is absorbed to the conductive layer and then induces a charge. Therefore unless the charge is escaped by grounding the optical filter acts as an antenna to oscillate the electromagnetic wave thereby deteriorating the electromagnetic shielding ability. Thus the optical filter has to be electrically connected to a grounding portion of the display and the first light transmittable tacky material layer and the functional film need to be formed on the conductive mesh layer while remaining a conducting portion that can electrically conduct from the outside. Though the shape of the conducting portion is not particularly limited it is important not to form a space from which the electromagnetic wave is leaked between the optical filter and the display. It is preferred that the conducting portion is continuously formed on the periphery of the conductive mesh layer. Thus the conducting portion is preferably provided in a frame shape surrounding the displaying portion of the display.

The conducting portion may be a mesh pattern layer or an unpatterned layer of a solid metal foil or the like. To improve the electric connection between the optical filter and the grounding portion of the display the unpatterned layer of a solid metal foil or the like is preferred.

In a case where the conducting portion is the unpatterned layer of a solid metal foil or the like and or a case where the conducting portion has a sufficient mechanical strength the conducting portion per se can be preferably used as an electrode.

In some cases an electrode is preferably formed in the conducting portion to protect the conducting portion and or to improve the electric connection between the grounding portion and the conducting portion of a mesh pattern layer. The shape of the electrode is not particularly limited and it is preferred that the entire conducting portion is covered with the electrode.

The material of the electrode may be selected in view of conductivity corrosion resistance adhesion to the transparent conductive layer etc. from simple substances of silver copper nickel aluminum chromium iron zinc carbon etc. alloys thereof mixtures of a synthetic resin and the simple substance or the alloy and mixtures of a borosilicate glass and the simple substance or the alloy. The electrode may be formed by using a paste of the material and the paste may be printed or applied by a known method. Further a commercially available conductive tape may be preferably used as the electrode. The both surfaces of the conductive tape are conductive and the conductive tape may be a single or double faced tape using a carbon dispersed conductive adhesive. The thickness of the electrode is not particularly limited and is generally about several m to several mm.

The optical filter according to this embodiment has excellent optical property and thereby can maintain or improve the image quality of the plasma display without significant deterioration of the luminance. Further the optical filter has excellent electromagnetic shielding ability and thereby can shield the electromagnetic wave from the plasma display which has a possibility of damaging health. Furthermore the optical filter can efficiently cut the near infrared ray around 800 to 1000 nm emitted from the plasma display to reduce the adverse affect of the ray on peripheral electronic devices such as remote controls and optical communication transmission systems and thus can prevent malfunction of the devices. Furthermore the optical filter can be produced at low cost with excellent weather resistance.

The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples. Materials amounts ratios treatment contents treatment procedures and the like used in Examples may be changed without departing from the scope of the invention. The following examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.

An emulsion which contained an aqueous medium a gelatin and silver iodobromochloride particles I content 0.2 mol Br content 40 moil average spherical equivalent diameter 0.1 m was prepared. The amount of the gelatin was 10.0 g per 60 g of Ag.

KRhBrand KIrClwere added to the emulsion at a concentration of 10mol mol silver to dope the silver bromide particles with Rh and Ir ions. Further NaPdClwas added to the emulsion and the resultant emulsion was gold sulfur sensitized using chlorauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. The obtained emulsion and a gelatin hardening agent were applied to a polyethylene terephthalate PET support such that the amount of the silver applied was 1 g m. The Ag gelatin volume ratio was 1 2 the PET support had a width of 30 cm and the emulsion was applied into a width of 25 cm and a length of 20 m.

The both end portions having a width of 3 cm were cut off to obtain a roll photosensitive silver halide material having a width of 24 cm.

The photosensitive silver halide material was exposed by using a continuous exposure apparatus. In the apparatus exposure heads using a DMD a digital mirror device described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2004 1244 were arranged into a width of 25 cm. The exposure heads and exposure stages were arranged on a curved line to concentrate laser lights onto the photosensitive layer of the photosensitive material. Further in the apparatus a feeding mechanism and a winding mechanism for the photosensitive material were disposed and a buffering bend was formed such that the speed in the exposure part was not affected by changing the exposure surface tension and feeding and winding speeds. The light for the exposure had a wavelength of 400 nm and a beam shape of 12 m square and the output of the laser light source was 100 J.

The photosensitive material was exposed in a lattice pattern with a width of 24 cm and a length of 10 m. In the pattern 12 m pixels were tilted at 45 degree at a pitch of 300 m. The exposure was carried out under the following conditions to print a mesh pattern. The wire width of the conductive portion the position of the moire preventing part etc. in the mesh pattern are shown in Table 1.

A composite mesh pattern containing the mesh pattern and the pattern of the moire preventing parts in the opening portions was formed by an exposure method using three exposure heads in combination.

This exposure method is described below. By using the first exposure head the photosensitive layer is irradiated with a constant laser beam while reciprocating the laser beam in the direction perpendicular to the direction of transporting the photosensitive layer to draw an exposure pattern on the photosensitive layer. Thus the pattern is drawn by the beam at 45 in accordance with the ratio of the photosensitive layer transporting speed and the head reciprocating speed in the perpendicular direction. After the laser beam reaches an end of the photosensitive layer the pattern is drawn at the reversed angle depending on the reciprocal motion of the head.

By using the second exposure head in the same manner as the first exposure head the photosensitive layer is irradiated with a constant laser beam while reciprocating the laser beam in the direction perpendicular to the direction of transporting the layer to draw an exposure pattern on the layer. The motion start point of the second exposure head is different from that of the first exposure head by 180 degree or the multiple. Thus when the first exposure head is moved obliquely from one end of the photosensitive layer the second exposure head is moved obliquely from the other end in the opposite direction so that the mesh pattern is formed.

The third exposure head is a fixed type head while the first and second exposure heads are mobile type heads that can be reciprocated in the direction perpendicular to the photosensitive layer transporting direction. The third exposure head is positioned approximately at the center of the opening portion of the mesh pattern . To dispose a number of the opening portions in the width direction of the photosensitive layer the same number of the third heads is used. The laser emission frequency of the third head is set such that the photosensitive layer is irradiated with a laser beam intermittently only when the third head is on the opening portion. Further the emission time is set such that the resultant moire preventing part has a desired size.

The exposed photosensitive material was treated with the above treatment agents under the following conditions using an automatic processor FG 710PTS manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation. Thus a development treatment was carried out at 35 C. for 30 seconds a fixation treatment was carried out at 34 C. for 23 seconds and a water washing treatment was carried out for 20 seconds at a water flow rate of 5 L min.

The running conditions were such that the amount of the photosensitive material treated was 100 m day the replenishment amount of the developer was 500 ml m the replenishment amount of the fixer was 640 ml m and the treatment period was 3 days. It was confirmed that a copper pattern had a wire width of 12 m and a pitch of 300 m after a plating treatment.

The material was subjected to an electroless copper plating treatment at 45 C. using an electroless plating solution an electroless Cu plating solution having a pH of 12.5 containing 0.06 mol L of copper sulfate 0.22 mol L of formalin 0.12 mol L of triethanolamine 100 ppm of a polyethylene glycol 50 ppm of yellow prussiate of potash and 20 ppm of bipyridine . The material was then subjected to an oxidation treatment using an aqueous solution containing 10 ppm of Fe III ion to produce an electromagnetic shielding film.

As shown in Table 1 in Example the conductive portion of the mesh pattern had a wire width of 14 m and the moire preventing part was formed at the center of the opening portion for example at the intersection point of the first line and the second line shown in .

200 areas were optionally selected in a sample of the electromagnetic shielding film and the surface resistances of the areas were measured by LORESTA GP Model No. MCP T610 manufactured by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd. utilizing an in line four probe method ASP to evaluate the uniformity of surface resistance.

The original electromagnetic shielding film of a PDP TH 42PX300 manufactured by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. was detached from the PDP body. A turntable was disposed on the PDP body for the purpose of attaching the above produced electromagnetic shielding film thereto. The turntable was a glass plate having a thickness of 5 mm usable as a front plate of the PDP. Further the turntable had an angle scale for measuring the bias angle of the attached electromagnetic shielding film. The PDP was turned on and a pattern generator ASTROVG828D was connected to an HDMI terminal of the PDP. A white 255 signal was transmitted at the maximum output from the pattern generator to the PDP. The electromagnetic shielding film was fixed to the turntable using a tape to prevent the deflection. The moire of the electromagnetic shielding film was visually observed and evaluated in a dark room while turning the turntable within a bias angle range of 45 to 45 . The moire was observed at a distance of 1.5 m from the PDP while changing the bias angle and evaluated as Excellent Good or Poor. Excellent means that the moire was not visible Good means that the moire was slightly visible to an acceptable extent and Poor means that the moire was highly visible. In the overall evaluation each electromagnetic shielding film was evaluated as A B C or D. A means that the film was evaluated as Excellent in an angular range of 10 or more B means that the film was evaluated as Excellent in an angular range of less than 10 C means that the film was not evaluated as Excellent at any angle and was evaluated as Poor in an angular range of less than 10 and D means that the film was not evaluated as Excellent at any angle and was evaluated as Poor in an angular range of 10 or more.

As shown in Table 1 the electromagnetic shielding film of Example was excellent in conductivity and light transmittance without visible moire.

It is clear from the evaluation results that by forming the moire preventing part in the opening portion of the mesh pattern the moire can be prevented while achieving excellent conductivity and light transmittance.

Films of Examples 1 to 21 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were produced and the moire conductivity and light transmittance of each film were evaluated in the same manner as First Example. The conditions and the evaluation results of Examples 1 to 21 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 are shown in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2 in Examples 1 to 7 the conductive portion of the mesh pattern had a wire width of 14 m and the moire preventing part was formed at the center of the opening portion . The ratios Sb Sa of the area Sb of the intersection to the area Sa of the moire preventing part were 0.1 0.5 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.5 and 1.9 respectively.

In Examples 8 to 14 the conductive portion of the mesh pattern had a wire width of 21 m and the moire preventing part was formed at the center of the opening portion . The ratios Sb Sa of the area Sb of the intersection to the area Sa of the moire preventing part were 0.1 0.5 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.5 and 1.9 respectively.

In Examples 15 to 21 the conductive portion of the mesh pattern had a wire width of 28 m and the moire preventing part was formed at the center of the opening portion . The ratios Sb Sa of the area Sb of the intersection to the area Sa of the moire preventing part were 0.1 0.5 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.5 and 1.9 respectively.

In Comparative Example 1 the wire width was 14 m and the moire preventing part was not formed. In Comparative Example 2 the wire width was 21 m and the moire preventing part was not formed. In Comparative Example 3 the wire width was 28 m and the moire preventing part was not formed.

The results are shown in Table 2. In Comparative Examples 1 2 and 3 the moire was highly visible and evaluated as C.

In contrast the films of Examples 1 to 21 exhibited excellent conductivity and excellent light transmittance without the moire problem. Particularly in Examples 4 11 and 18 using the ratios Sb Sa of 1.0 the moire was not visible and evaluated as A.

It is clear from the evaluation results that when the area Sa of the intersection and the area Sb of the moire preventing part satisfy the inequality 0.1Sa Sb 1.9Sa the conductivity and light transmittance can be improved without the moire problem. Particularly when the area Sa and the area Sb satisfy the equality Sb Sa 1.0 the moire can be prevented more effectively.

The electromagnetic shielding film of Example of First Example Example 4 of Second Example was treated with a copper blackening liquid so that the copper surface was blackened. The blackening liquid used was COPPER BLACK commercially available from Isolate Kagaku Kenkyusho. Then a protective film having a total thickness of 28 m Model No. HT 25 available from Panac Industries Inc. was attached to the PET surface using a laminator roller.

Further a protective film having a total thickness of 65 m SUNYTECT Y 26F trade name available from Sun A. Kaken Co. Ltd. prepared by stacking an acrylic tacky material layer on a polyethylene film was attached to the electromagnetic shielding film side the mesh pattern side using a laminator roller.

The PET surface was attached to a glass plate having a thickness of 2.5 mm and an overall size of 950 mm 550 mm using a transparent acrylic tacky material therebetween.

Then an antireflection near infrared absorbing film CLEARAS AR NIR trade name available from Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co. Ltd. having a 100 m thick PET film an antireflection layer and a near infrared absorber containing layer was attached to the inner region of the conductivity mesh layer other than the 20 mm wide outer edge areas disposing a 25 m thick acrylic light transmittable tacky material therebetween. Toning dyes for controlling the transmittance of a display filter PS Red G and PS Violet RC available from Mitsui Chemicals Inc. were added to the layer of the acrylic light transmittable tacky material. Further an antireflection film REALOOK 8201 trade name available from NOF Corporation was attached by a tacky material to the opposite main surface of the glass plate to produce a display filter.

The obtained display filter had a remarkably small number of scratches and defects in the metal mesh since the protective film was used on the electromagnetic shielding film. The display image was not metal colored by the electromagnetic shielding film since the metal mesh was blackened. Further the display filter had practically satisfactory electromagnetic shielding ability and near infrared cutoff function had a transmittance of 15 or less in a region of 300 to 800 nm and exhibited an excellent viewability due to the antireflection layers on both sides. Furthermore the display filter had a toning function due to the added dyes and thereby can be suitably used in plasma display devices etc.

The light transmittable electromagnetic shielding film and the optical filter of the present invention are not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
