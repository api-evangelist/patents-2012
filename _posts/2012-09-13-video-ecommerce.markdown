In one embodiment the video e commerce module is a web widget however the invention is not thus limited. In one embodiment the video e commerce module is based on the Adobe Flash Player platform and associated ActionScript scripting language however the invention is not thus limited. For example in other embodiments the video e commerce module may be based on Mobile Silverlight VB C Java Applet etc.

In stage information on a product or service is inputted for example via product uploader . Depending on the embodiment information on a product service may be inputted via product uploader in any appropriate manner. For example in one embodiment product service information may be entered manually. As another example product service information may be copied from a vendor system for example using a drag and drop procedure. Continuing with the example in some cases the procedure may be based on XML and or other API web services. As another example product service uploader may interface with a vendor system and retrieve product service information.

In some embodiments a video is associated with one or more products and or services. In some of these embodiments as part of stage a web link e.g. URL to the associated video for example on a video sharing website i.e. content distribution network such as YouTube Google video etc. is entered via product uploader into publishing system . For example in one of these embodiments the product uploader may then use the web link to connect to the video sharing website and retrieve meta data associated with the video. Continuing with the example in some cases the meta data may include inter alia any of the following title tags and description relating to the video. In other embodiments the video itself may be uploaded via product uploader in stage . As an aside it is noted that the video sharing website may in some cases host videos on a backbone of a larger content distribution network such as Akamai and therefore the actual location of the video may be on a server of the larger content distribution network.

Assuming embodiments where a particular video is associated with a plurality of products services in one of these embodiments product uploader may also upload a mapping between the different segments of that video and the various associated products services. For example the beginning and ending elapsed times of each video segment relating to a different product service may be mapped to the associated product service.

The product service information entered in stage is not limited by the invention and may comprise any type of information relating to the associated video including any of the following inter alia video video link video thumbnail link to thumbnail and or video metadata. For each product service associated with the video the product service information entered in stage may comprise any type of information including any of the following inter alia category identifier product service name description pricing link to inventory engine picture or picture link vendor information including vendor identifier reviews professional and or viewer comments tags link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc.

In some embodiments some or all of the product service information entered in stage is stored in the data repository of the rendering system . For example any of the following inter alia may be stored metadata on video product service name description pricing link to inventory engine category identifier picture or picture link vendor information including vendor identifier comments tags reviews professional or viewer link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc may be stored in data repository . As another example depending on the embodiment a link to the associated video and or link to video thumbnail on a video sharing website may be stored in data repository and or or the associated video and or thumbnail may be stored in data repository . For simplicity of description it is assumed below that a link to the video is stored in data repository and not the video itself.

As mentioned above the order of stages shown in is not necessarily the same for all embodiments. For example stage in some cases is performed next either partly or fully whereas in other cases stage is performed right before stage . Continuing with the example in one embodiment if stage or stage is executed then stage is performed fully or partially after stage whereas if stage is executed then stage is performed prior to stage . Nevertheless stage is described now.

In stage a video e commerce module is configured using for example system configurator . In some embodiments there are features that are always present in the e commerce module and other features which may be configured in stage . For example in some of these embodiments there is a generic e commerce module which includes capabilities common to all modules. Continuing with the example common features may include in some cases any of the following inter alia video playing capabilities some or all aspects of the user interface and or logic within the module for example allowing any of the following inter alia processing indications from a viewer grabbing code posting the module navigating the menu exploring the playlist printing calling and or linking to outside resources providing information to a viewer and or tracking . Continuing with the example in one of these embodiments part of the common logic within the module allows the completion of a purchase transaction within the module. In embodiments with a generic e commerce module in stage a new video e commerce module is configured by taking the generic video e commerce module and selecting features which are not necessarily common to all modules. Alternatively in this embodiment the video e commerce module may be configured starting with an already configured e commerce module and further adapting some of the configurable features. For example in some cases configurable features may include any of the following inter alia autoplay of product service videos versus muted autoplay of product service videos versus non automatic play of product service videos automatic rotation of videos versus manual rotation or no rotation menus on versus menus off price comparison on versus off and or appearance of the module e.g. color size etc . In one embodiment some features may be left un configured to be configured at a later stage see below stage or may be configured and later optionally re configured for example at stage .

A catalog of one or more products services is associated with the configured video e commerce module. It is assumed that all of the products services in the catalog of products services associated with the video e commerce module are inputted via product uploader prior to the catalog being created. Depending on the embodiment the catalog can be created by playlist creator as part of the procedure of configuring the video e commerce module the catalog could have been created earlier and may be available for selection by playlist explorer or the catalog may be created in time to be accessible to a viewer.

Assuming the creation of catalog as part of the procedure of configuring the video e commerce module in stage the catalog including a video playlist is created by playlist creator . In the illustrated embodiment a feature of the catalog is that the catalog includes inter alia video s or links to video s because video tends to provide a rich multi media experience of the product s service s and therefore in this embodiment a playlist of one or more videos is an integral part of the catalog. In this embodiment selection or identification of a catalog inherently selects or identifies the included playlist and vice versa. The catalog and included playlist can be created manually or automatically depending on the embodiment. In the manual creation mode video s of product s service s which have previously been inputted are available for exploring via video explorer . For example in one embodiment via video explorer a user may be presented with the meta data of an available video with the name of the product s service s associated with the video with any other product s service s information and or with the opportunity to view the video for example by clicking on a textual or icon link to a video sharing website . The user may thus select the product s service s to be comprised in the catalog or equivalently the associated video s on the playlist .

In some embodiments of the automatic mode of creation of catalog and included playlist playlist creator selects the product s service s associated video s and or sequences the playing of the videos in the playlist based on criteria specified by a user for example vendor name s product service category ies the maximum minimum or exact number of product s service s and or video s to be selected the maximum minimum or exact number of vendor s to be selected the maximum minimum or exact number of product service category ies to be selected desired level of performance for example based on past tracking data etc. In these embodiments depending on the embodiment the user may also specify the rules of the algorithm choose from among available algorithm rules or the algorithm rules may be predefined by the facilitator. In other embodiments of the automatic mode playlist creator selects the product s service s associated video s and or sequences the playing of the videos randomly or based on an algorithm specified by the video e commerce facilitator. In some cases when the algorithm is less defined by the user and more defined by the facilitator there may be a greater reliance on past experience i.e. from tracking data in selection of the product s service s associated video s and the sequencing the videos but less customization to the user s preferences. In some cases where there is random selection sequencing of product s service s associated video s to be included in the catalog i.e. when a more experimental approach is taken in some cases tracking engine may collect statistics on product s service s associated video s which on first glance would not be assumed to perform well but may be found based on the statistics to perform well or vice versa. Therefore it should be evident that there are advantages to various approaches of automatic creation of the catalog with tradeoffs between user customization reliance on past experience and experimentation.

In another embodiment a pre existing catalog playlist i.e. which is stored in data repository is selected via playlist explorer in stage . For example the user may input a playlist catalog identifier via playlist explorer . As another example the user may specify criteria such for example as vendor name s highest performer s based on tracking data and or category ies of product s service s and playlist explorer may then present the user with the catalog playlist which includes product s service s that match the criteria.

In another embodiment the video e commerce module is configured in stage for example via configurator to enable run time generation of the catalog and the included playlist.

In another embodiment a catalog playlist is selected in stage or created in stage and in stage the video e commerce module is configured to enable run time modification of the created or selected catalog playlist.

For example there may be parameter called herein below vsense which in stage is disabled if run time generation modification is not desired and enabled if run time generation modification is desired.

Depending on the embodiment there may be a higher or lower level of customization in stage of a generation modification algorithm which will be executed in run time for selecting product s service s associated video s for the catalog playlist and or for video sequencing. For example in one embodiment there may be no customization based on the configured video e commerce module and the algorithm will be randomly determined or the algorithm may have been predefined for selector by the facilitator. For example in some cases random selection sequencing of product s service s associated video s to be included in the catalog i.e. experimentation may allow tracking engine to collect statistics on product s service s associated video s which on first glance would not be assumed to perform well but may be found based on the statistics to perform well or vice versa. In embodiments where there is no customization based on the configured module the same algorithm may be executed for each module or different algorithms may be executed for different modules but with the differences in the algorithms independent of the various configurations of the different modules. As another example in one embodiment the algorithm rules may not be configured in stage e.g. the rules may have been predefined for selector by the facilitator but at least some of the e.g. selection and or sequencing criteria required for execution of the algorithm may be configured i.e. customized in stage . Examples of algorithm criteria which may be configured in this embodiment include any of the following inter alia the vendor name s product service category ies the maximum minimum or exact number of product s service s and or video s to be selected the maximum minimum or exact number of vendor s to be selected the maximum minimum or exact number of product service category ies to be selected etc. Examples of algorithm criteria which are less likely to be configured in stage of this embodiment include any of the following inter alia website keywords viewer data and or uncontrollable variables e.g. time of day weather day of week etc. of algorithm execution . If the algorithm relies at least partly on tracking data e.g. the number of buy it now click counts or the number of view counts for a product service video then the type s of tracking data to be relied upon in the algorithm may or may not be configured in stage of this embodiment. As another example in one embodiment a user may select from among different available algorithms and configure the algorithm identifier i.e. associate the algorithm identifier with the module in stage . In this embodiment the user may or may not also configure the algorithm criteria. As another example in one embodiment the user may configure the rules of the algorithm in stage . In this embodiment the user may or may not also configure the algorithm criteria. In some cases when the algorithm is less customized and more defined by the facilitator there may be a greater reliance on past experience i.e. from tracking data in the selection of the product s service s associated video s and the sequencing the videos. There are therefore advantages to various approaches to the generation modification algorithm with tradeoffs between user customization reliance on past experience and experimentation.

In one embodiment where stage occurs at least partly during or after the creation or selection of the catalog playlist in stage or after the playlist has been created or selected a user configures which video will be the first to be played from the playlist for example by specifying the video identifier of the first to play video.

In stage the video e commerce module is stored in data repository . For example in some embodiments data repository may be structured by entries with one entry defining the current video e commerce module including an identifier of the current video e commerce module features of the generic video e commerce module features configured for the current video e commerce module the playlist identifier which inherently also identifies the catalog if a playlist was selected or created and if run time generation modification of the playlist was enabled then in some cases the algorithm rules and or criteria for run time generation modification. In turn each playlist catalog identifier corresponds to an entry which includes a list of identifiers for all the videos on the playlist for example in the order that the videos are to be played. The entry may include video sequencing information for example always or only if the list of video identifiers is not in the order that the video are to played. Continuing with this example in one of these embodiments each video identifier corresponds to an entry which includes any of the following inter alia a link to the video for example on the video sharing website a link to the video thumbnail on the video sharing website and or the thumbnail itself meta data on the video and one or more identifiers of products services associated with the video. In this embodiment each product service identifier corresponds to an entry which includes any of the following inter alia product service information such as name description category identifier pricing link to inventory engine picture s or picture link s vendor information including vendor identifier reviews professional and or viewer comments tags link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc. In another of these embodiments for this example where a video corresponds to only one product service all the data on the video and the product service may be included in the same entry for example including any of the following inter alia an identifier of the video product service link to video link to video thumbnail and or thumbnail itself metadata on video product service name description pricing link to inventory engine picture s or picture link s vendor information including vendor identifier reviews professional and or viewer comments tags link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc. It is noted that the various product service video entries may have already been created in stage . If the catalog playlist was created in stage then the catalog playlist entry would also need to be stored in data repository for example in stage . However if a pre existing catalog playlist was selected in stage then the catalog playlist entry would have been stored earlier at the time of the original creation of the catalog playlist.

It should be understood that a catalog can include one or more product s and or service s and the playlist can include one or more video s . In some cases where the playlist includes one video the playlist identifier may be replaced by the video identifier and therefore the video e commerce module entry in data repository may include the associated video identifier rather than the playlist identifier. In other cases the video e commerce module entry includes the playlist identifier regardless of the number of videos in the playlist.

In some cases the video e commerce module entry in data repository may include both the playlist identifier and a video identifier which identifies the first video on the playlist to play.

Once the video e commerce module has been stored in data repository the module is available for selection in stage . For example a user may browse available video e commerce modules via a private explorer webpage of publishing system and select an available video e commerce module. As another example a user may browse video e commerce modules by accessing a vendor web page of a vendor web site which references a public explorer page . As mentioned above in some cases in this example public explorer page may be hosted on a server of the video e commerce facilitator. Continuing with the example in some cases only video e commerce modules with a relationship to the vendor may be available via the vendor web page e.g. associated catalog includes product service of that vendor or e.g. identifier of vendor or category of vendor s products services specified for run time generation modification of catalog playlist etc . As another example a user may browse available video e commerce modules among all offerings of affiliate network using affiliate explorer . Examples of currently available affiliate networks include inter alia CJ.com and linkshare.com. Depending on the embodiment it may or may not be evident to the user that an explorer page is hosted on a server of the video e commerce facilitator and for example in one embodiment public explorer page when hosted by the facilitator server may still appear to be part of vendor web site .

The user in one embodiment who is selecting the module may be an affiliate who wishes to publish the module on a website thereof and thereby participate in the video e commerce. Hence affiliates are also known as publishers . There is no limitation however on the nature of the user and non affiliate users in some embodiments may also be able to access video e commerce modules and or select such modules. For simplicity of description it is assumed below that the user who selects the module is an affiliate or that the selection is performed on behalf of an affiliate.

In stage the corresponding configurator for example configurator configurator or configurator is used to further configure re configure the selected video e commerce module. For example an identifier of the user who selected the module for example an affiliate code may be associated with the module. In some cases of this example if the user is a registered user then the identifier may be known to the corresponding configurator but if the user is not a registered user then the user may have to manually input the identifier. In some embodiments of this example the affiliate code allows the affiliate to receive compensation for certain action s of a viewer of the module on a website of the affiliate and thereby participate in the video e commerce. In one of these embodiments the affiliate code is embedded in the link for buying from vendor online store i.e. buy it now link and possibly in other links to the vendor so that the vendor can properly compensate the affiliate. As another example certain features of the module may be configured or reconfigured in stage including any of the following inter alia autoplay of product service videos versus muted autoplay of product service videos versus non automatic play of product service videos automatic rotation of videos versus manual rotation versus no rotation menus on versus menus off price comparison on versus off and or appearance of the module e.g. color size etc .

In stage the video e commerce module is published on i.e. associated with the website of the affiliate. The type of website is not limited by the invention. In some embodiments the module is published on an affiliate webpage which includes data unrelated to the module. Examples of such WebPages include inter alia a blog a generic website a search engine a social platform e.g. Facebook etc. In others embodiments publishing includes devoting an entire webpage to the module. For example in one of these embodiments instead of having an underutilized or expired domain parked domain contain advertisement listings and links or redirect to another website a video e commerce module can be published on the parked domain . Parked domain will then function as a shopping network. For the sake of illustration in video e commerce modules are shown published on various WebPages .

In one embodiment it may be possible for a first affiliate to view a module on a webpage of a second affiliate for example see grab code or post code feature of the module described below with reference to and decide to also publish that module. The first affiliate may then select the viewed module stage and change the current affiliate code stage from the affiliate code of the second affiliate to the affiliate code of the first affiliate prior to publishing the module on the website of the first affiliate in stage .

The video e commerce module may be published in any appropriate manner and by any appropriate means. For example in one embodiment publishing may include a simple copy command see for example grab code feature of module described below and a paste command to publish the module on a target webpage. As another example in one embodiment the module may include a post module interface see below description of module features within the module which allows the publishing of the module on a target webpage. As another example alternatively or additionally an application programming interface API of the target website may service the request to publish the module. Continuing with the example the affiliate may be required to provide identification such as user name and password prior to being allowed to publish the module on a webpage.

In the illustrated embodiment once the video e commerce module has been published on i.e. associated with a webpage the associated webpage includes information which allows a browser when loading the associated webpage to load the module which resides on facilitator server s see stage . For example the included information can include any of the following inter alia module identifier link to facilitator server s where data repository including the module resides etc. In this embodiment stage activity may also be reflected on the associated webpage during the publishing stage of and or may be reflected in the data on the module which is stored in data repository depending on the particular implementation. It is possible however that in other embodiments the video e commerce module once published resides on a server of the affiliate website and is therefore loaded by the browser from the affiliate server.

In stage the web browser of a viewer accesses the webpage on which the module has been published and therefore loads the video e commerce module onto the client i.e. onto the user device of the viewer . For the sake of illustration the video e commerce module is shown in loaded onto user device of the viewer. In some embodiments the video e commerce module is adapted to conform to the type of client for example computer versus mobile telephone. In one of these embodiments the adaptation is based on browser type as provided by the browser.

In stage the video e commerce module once loaded provides to a selector one or more parameters which allows selector to retrieve the catalog playlist associated with the module and return the catalog playlist in stage to the video e commerce module. In one embodiment selector is assisted by an API for example a web service. In some cases if creation modification is enabled selector creates or modifies the catalog playlist to be retrieved based on the parameter s stage . In other cases an identifier of the catalog playlist to be retrieved is provided as a parameter to selector .

Refer to which illustrates a method executed by selector corresponding to stages and according to an embodiment of the present invention. In some cases method may include fewer more and or different stages than illustrated in the stages may be executed in a different order than shown in stages that are illustrated as being executed sequentially may be executed in parallel and or stages that are illustrated as being executed in parallel may be executed sequentially.

In stage the video e commerce module which has been loaded onto client calls selector . In the illustrated embodiment it is assumed that parameter s identifying the catalog playlist or which can influence the selection of the catalog playlist is provided to selector . For example if a playlist identifier or video identifier has been associated with the module then the identifier is provided to selector in stage . As another example additionally or alternatively keywords of website where the module was published may be provided to selector in stage . Continuing with the example in one embodiment the video e commerce module has the functionality to interrogate the document object module of the browser in order to receive the keywords. These keywords may in some cases allow selector to create modify a catalog including a playlist which is an appropriate fit with the content of website . As another example additionally or alternatively if selection and or sequencing criteria have been specified during configuration of the module for example in stage then the criteria are provided to selector in stage . As another example additionally or alternatively if algorithm rules had been specified during configuration of the module for example in stage then the rules are provided to selector . As another example additionally or alternatively the value of the vsense parameter may be provided in stage specifying whether or not run time generation modification of the catalog playlist is enabled or disabled.

In some embodiments the video e commerce module may also provide data on the viewer to selector . In one of these embodiments viewer data may be derived without the viewer actively disclosing information. For example geo data on the viewer e.g. the geographic location of the viewer may be derived from the IP address and or other data of client . In another embodiment additionally or alternatively viewer data may be provided explicitly by the viewer. Continuing with this embodiment in some cases the viewer may register with the video e commerce facilitator specifying information which can be used to customize the catalog and included playlist to the preferences of the viewer. Continuing with this embodiment in some cases the viewer may register via system configurator configurator or custom affiliate configurator . For example the viewer may specify the categories of products videos and or the vendors from which the viewer is interested in buying. The viewer specified data may be stored on client for example in a cookie and provided by the video e commerce module to selector after the module has been loaded onto the client. Alternatively the viewer specified data may be stored in data repository i.e. in this embodiment data repository may also include viewer entries and retrieved by selector after having identified the viewer. For example during the registration process an identifier of the viewer may be established which can be transmitted by the video e commerce module after the module has been loaded onto client .

In the illustrated embodiment in stage selector determines whether the received vsense parameter is enabled and therefore run time generation or modification of the catalog playlist is desired.

If the vsense parameter is enabled then in stage selector selects the products services for the catalog or equivalently the associated video s on the playlist and sequences the video playing. As mentioned above with reference to stage there may be different levels of customization of the algorithm for selection of the products services for the catalog and the associated video s for the playlist and for the sequencing of the video playing.

There are many possible algorithms which can be executed by selector . The algorithm shown in stage is only one example of a possible algorithm and should therefore not be considered to bind the invention. In the algorithm illustrated in stage selector retrieves the top N videos from data repository where one of the keywords appears in the tag field of at least one or all of the products services associated with the video or in the description field of at least one or all of the products services associated with the video and where the vendor identifier and category identifier of at least one of the products services associated with the video or where the vendor identifier and category identifier of all of the associated products services match one of the vendor identifiers and category identifiers provided to the selector in stage . Selector then sequences the top N videos using tracking data including buy it now checkout click count and or view count so that the video with the highest count for sales and or views is sequenced to be played first. In one embodiment where a video is associated with multiple products services the tracking data is totaled for all the associated products services whereas in another embodiment the tracking data is for one of the associated product services for example the first product service mentioned in the video.

In the illustrated embodiment for the first retrieved record i.e. for the retrieved entry of the first sequenced video in stage because no temporary playlist exists no to stage a temporary playlist is created in stage . In stage the video identifier is added to the created temporary playlist. For each subsequent retrieved record the corresponding video identifier is also added to the created temporary playlist in a subsequent round of stage . When all N records have been retrieved yes to stage the data in data repository which correspond to the N records is retrieved and the total data i.e. the created catalog which includes the created playlist is returned to the video e commerce module in stage . In stage the temporary playlist may be deleted if desired. Method then ends.

If alternatively vsense is disabled no to stage selector determines in stage if the playlist identifier had been provided. If a playlist identifier has not been provided a video identifier will have been provided stage . Therefore in stage selector returns to the video e commerce module the data relating to the single video from data repository and method ends. In this case the playlist will comprise one video and therefore the catalog will relate to the product s service s associated with the single video

If the playlist or equivalently catalog identifier has been provided yes to stage then in stage selector returns to the video e commerce module the data from data repository relating to each video on the identified playlist i.e. returns a catalog and method ends.

For each video the data returned in stage or may include any of the following inter alia a link to the video for example on the video sharing website a link to the video thumbnail and or thumbnail itself and meta data on the video. The sequencing of the videos may also be indicated. For each of the products services associated with a particular video the data returned in stage or may include any of the following inter alia product service information such as name description pricing link to inventory engine picture s or picture link s vendor information product service or video identifier category identifier comments tags reviews professional and or viewer link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc.

In some cases the catalog and included playlist returned in stage or may also include any links to related live video feeds which are currently being captured or are scheduled to be captured within the near future for example within ten minutes or within the period that a viewer is expected to interact with the module with these live video feeds also sequenced within the returned playlist. The live feed s link may for example link to the source of the video streaming directly or via vendor web site s . The related live video feed s for example may be consistent with products services retrieved from data repository as part of the catalog the categories of the retrieved products services in the catalog the vendors of the retrieved products services in the catalog the website keywords the viewer specified information etc.

In another embodiment where the video e commerce module is stored on the affiliate server upon publishing the data constituting the catalog and included playlist may be stored on a server of affiliate website soon after the video e commerce module is published on website . For example similarly to method but occurring once the video e commerce module is published on website the catalog playlist may be created on the fly by selector or the playlist identifier video identifier may be passed to selector . The data retrieved from data repository i.e. the catalog and included playlist is provided to and stored on an affiliate server for example the same affiliate server which houses the video e commerce module. The data retrieved and stored may include any of the following inter alia for each video a link to the video for example on the video sharing website a link to the video thumbnail and or thumbnail itself and meta data on the video. The sequencing of the videos may also be indicated. For each of the products services associated with a particular video the data retrieved and stored may include any of the following inter alia product service information such as name description pricing link to inventory engine picture s or picture link s vendor information product service or video identifier category identifier comments tags reviews professional and or viewer link for chatting with vendor online store link for buying from vendor online store email address for sending an email to vendor online store link for talking with vendor call center link to comparison pricing engine link to payment gateway etc. In this embodiment the retrieved data which is stored on the affiliate server may be downloaded to client i.e. received at client when the video e commerce module is loaded to the browser.

Refer to which illustrates components within the video e commerce module according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment the components include VOIP click to call Instant Messaging IM live chat email vendor click for call back checkout via module countdown grab code post module send to a friend log in price comparison explorer save video photos reviews comments product service details buy it now redirect advertisement banner menu navigator video player and controls live stream and print . The video e commerce module is not necessarily bound by the components illustrated in . The particular breakdown of the video e commerce module into components shown in was chosen for ease of explanation but it should be evident that in some cases the video e commerce module may comprise fewer more and or different components than those illustrated in and or a particular component may have more less and or different functionality than described herein. Each component of the video e commerce module may be made up of any combination of hardware software and or firmware capable of performing the operations as defined and explained herein. In one embodiment certain components of the video e commerce module are activated after the catalog and included playlist or single video link has been received at client and or upon indication by the viewer.

For example in the illustrated embodiment the video player and controls component provides the capability to play videos on the playlist of the catalog or the one video whose episode video identifier was instead identified and optionally any of the following functions inter alia rewind fast forward stop pause volume replay video skip to next video go back to previous video etc. In one embodiment the video player is a flash video player. If there is a playlist of more than one video the first video to play may have been configured manually or selected automatically as discussed above. The videos for example depending on the module configuration may begin playing automatically once the playlist or single video link has been received at client begin playing automatically but are muted or may only play upon viewer request i.e. the activation trigger for playing may vary depending on the embodiment .

Referring to stage of method each time a video is played by video player the video link which was previously received as part of the playlist or as a single video link by client is passed to the location where the video resides and the video stream for example streamed flash video is returned to the video e commerce module. In one embodiment the video e commerce module includes a buffer in order to preload a certain amount of stream video before playing the video. In one embodiment the content distribution network ensures quality of service based on factors such as bandwidth location of server where video resides and client of viewer network congestion etc. as is known in the art.

Besides the playing of the videos the video e commerce module performs additional functionality for the viewer in stage . This additional functionality is also described with reference to .

In the illustrated embodiment the viewer has the option to browse the playlist via playlist explorer . The viewer can thus select a video to play out of sequence from the sequence previously established. In some cases playlist explorer includes a slide bar for easy reviewing thumbnail previews of videos on the playlist. In some cases playlist explorer continually provides the viewer with preview s of the next video s on the playlist.

In the illustrated embodiment the viewer has the option to save any video for example that is currently playing or any one from the playlist using the save video component . In some cases the saved videos can be browsed by logging in for example via publishing system or logging in from any video e commerce module and clicking on my saved videos which will cause save video component to show the saved videos. In this way the viewer can create his own video shopping site of the videos he has saved. In some cases the product service identifier for each product service associated with the saved video is also saved so that information on the product service s can be returned from data repository upon viewer request. As noted above in some cases when a video is associated with only one product service the video identifier may also identify the product service and therefore in these cases the video identifier may be saved instead in order to later be able to retrieve information on the product service from data repository . In some cases when the viewer views the saved video additional functionality as described with respect to one or more of the components of may also be available to the viewer relating to the saved video.

In the illustrated embodiment the viewer has the option via live stream component to select from among currently playing live video shows to call in to the live show and to receive the live video stream. In some cases the viewer can only select from among related live video shows e.g. consistent with any of the following products services in catalog the categories of those products services the vendors of those products services the website keywords the viewer specified information etc. but in other cases the viewer can select from any live video show. Depending on the embodiment the viewer may be connected to the source of the live streaming directly or via vendor web site s .

In the illustrated embodiment menu navigator allows the viewer to browse through different options available to him or her. For example in some cases options which are heavily promoted or considered to be essential for video e commerce can be selected by a viewer without traversing menu navigator for example with a separate control displayed on the user interface whereas other options which are not as heavily promoted or not considered to be essential may be selected by traversing menu navigator . Continuing with the example in one embodiment checkout via module or buy it now redirect as well as video playing and controlling are heavily promoted options whereas the other options are available for selection through the menu navigator. In one embodiment the display of the menu is configured on or off in stage or stage but may be later be turned off or on by the viewer.

In the illustrated embodiment grab code component post module component send to a friend component and or log in component allow the viewer to manipulate the video e commerce module for purposes unrelated to the catalog. For example if the viewer chooses to grab code grab code component copies the video e commerce module. Optionally grab code component also requests the affiliate code of the viewer so that the current affiliate code associated with the module can be changed to the affiliate code of the viewer. The viewer can then paste the module grabbed code optionally with the changed affiliate code on a webpage affiliated with the viewer. As another example if the viewer chooses to post module post module component requests the URL of the target web page for example blog generic website social platform parked domain or search engine etc. and automatically publishes the module to that web page changing the affiliate code to correspond to the affiliate code of the viewer. Continuing with the example in some cases if the viewer is a registered user the affiliate code of the viewer may be known whereas in other cases the viewer may manually enter his affiliate code. In one embodiment post module component may call a distribution system such as for example gigya.com to publish the module. See also description of stage above relating to grab code and post code . As another example if a viewer chooses to send the module to a friend send to a friend component will generate an email which will include a link to the video e commerce module. The friend can press on the link in the email and be directed to the video e commerce module. As another example a log in component allows a viewer to log into publishing system from any video e commerce module. Depending on the embodiment some or all of the features of publishing system may be accessible to the viewer via log in component . For example in one embodiment log in via a module may only allow access to reports and not to the other features of publishing system . In these examples grab code post code send to a friend and log in the viewer is not necessarily a potential buyer but may in some cases be instead an affiliate or potential affiliate a vendor etc.

In the illustrated embodiment certain components of the video e commerce module allow the viewer to view different types of data in the catalog. For example photos component reviews component comments component and or details component outputs data on the products services which was previously returned by selector . For example photos component displays photos of products services reviews component visibly and or audibly outputs reviews by professionals and or viewers of products service comments component visibly and or audibly outputs comments tags on products services details components visibly and or audibly outputs details on products services such as price short description if the product service is a hot deal or top seller specifications etc. In some cases the specifications may be available as a download e.g. PDF in addition to or instead of within the module. In one embodiment a viewer indicates the product service among those in the catalog returned by selector for which the viewer wishes to receive information e.g. photos reviews comments countdown details etc . In other embodiments when a viewer selects photos reviews comments details etc the data corresponding to the currently playing video or if no video is playing then the previous or next video on the playing list is provided. For example if video 3 on the playlist is currently playing and the viewer indicates a desire for photos a photo or photo s of the product service corresponding to video 3 is provided to the viewer by photos component . As another example if video 4 on the playlist is currently playing and video 4 on the playlist relates to two products services then in one of these embodiments the viewer may select whether photos are desired for both products services or indicate for which products service photo s are desired whereas in another of these embodiments the viewer may be presented with one or more photos relating to the product service corresponding to the currently playing segment of video 4. In the latter embodiment the mapping between the different segments of the video and the various associated products services discussed above may enable photo component or similarly for other types of data may enable any of components and or to determine the currently corresponding product service.

In one embodiment a viewer may also use photos component reviews component comments component and or details component to input data for example photos reviews comments tags etc. In this embodiment the inputted data may be saved to data repository for example by way of tracking engine . In some cases reviews components may present the viewer with forms and or polls i.e. surveys to fill out and the filled out information may be saved to data repository for example by way of tracking engine .

In the illustrated embodiment a viewer may also get external information which was not provided by selector for example via VOIP click to call component IM live chat component email vendor component click for callback component countdown component or price comparison component . For example VOIP click to call component provides the viewer with the capability of participating in a call over the Internet with another party for example vendor call center . Depending on the embodiment the VOIP call may or may not use other communication networks such as PSTN and cellular in addition to the Internet. As another example IM live chat component provides the viewer with the capability of participating in an online chat session with another party for example vendor online store . In some cases IM live chat component may additionally or alternatively allow the viewer to see the vendor live on video and see live product demonstrations. As another example email vendor component provides the viewer with the capability of sending an email to vendor online store . In some cases the viewer may fill out a form within the module including any of the following inter alia his name email address subject matter of the email for example chosen from a drop down list message text e.g. question etc and press a send button to send the message. In some cases the viewer may receive a confirmation email that the email was received and that the vendor will reply shortly. As another example click for call back component provides the viewer with the capability of receiving a callback from another party for example from vendor call center to a phone number defined by the viewer optionally at a time specified by the viewer. In this example the viewer may in some cases fill out a form within the video e commerce module including any of the following inter alia name phone number subject matter for example chosen from a drop down list message text e.g. question etc. As another example countdown component provides the viewer with a feed from inventory engine that includes data such as quantity of product service left in inventory time left to make a purchase at a particular price level or at all quantity of the product service sold etc. As another example price comparison component provides the viewer with a feed from a price comparison company with comparative pricing information such as Pronto.com.

In one embodiment a viewer indicates the product service among those in the catalog returned by selector for which the viewer wishes to receive external information for example by VOIP chat email callback inventory feed price comparison feed . In other embodiments when a viewer selects VOIP click to call IM live chat email to vendor click for callback countdown or price comparison the feature is activated for the product s service s corresponding to the currently playing video or if no video is playing then the previous or next video on the playing list . For example if video 5 on the playlist is currently playing and the viewer indicates a desire for VOIP call a VOIP call will be initiated by VOIP click to call component with the vendor call center for the product service corresponding to video 5. As another example if video 6 on the playlist is currently playing and video 6 on the playlist relates to five products services then in one of these embodiments the viewer may select whether a VOIP call is desired for all the related products services or an indicated subset of the five products services whereas in another of these embodiments a VOIP call may be initiated to the vendor call center for the product service corresponding to the currently playing segment of video 6. In the latter embodiment the mapping between the different segments of the video and the various associated products services discussed above may enable VOIP click to call component or in similar embodiments component or price comparison component to determine the currently corresponding product service.

In the illustrated embodiment the viewer may purchase products services in the catalog via buy it now redirect component and or checkout via module component . For example the buy it now redirect component redirects the viewer to vendor online store in accordance with the received link for buying from vendor online store i.e. the buy it now link in order to complete the transaction for that product service. As another example check out via module component allows the viewer to complete the transaction by way of the video e commerce module without being redirected to another website. Continuing with the example in one embodiment checkout component includes any of the following capabilities inter alia for completing the transaction communicating with inventory engine adding a product service to cart receiving from inventory engine inventory information indicating to inventory engine to reduce quantity of remaining inventory and or increase quantity sold receiving payment and delivery information from the viewer or deriving this information for example from a stored cookie on client communicating with payment gateway for payment approval and charging of viewer communicating the product service delivery information to vendor online store or to whichever entity is responsible for delivery etc. Depending on the embodiment the payment gateway may allow payment through various options including any of the following inter alia Google checkout paypal and credit card.

In one embodiment a viewer indicates the product service among those in the catalog returned by selector that the viewer wishes to buy for example using buy it now redirect or using checkout via module . In other embodiments when a viewer selects buy it now redirect or checkout via module the feature is activated for the product s service s corresponding to the currently playing video or if no video is playing then the previous or next video on the playing list . For example if video 7 on the playlist is currently playing and the viewer indicates a desire for checkout via module checkout via module component completes the transaction for the product service corresponding to video 7. As another example if video 8 on the playlist is currently playing and video 8 on the playlist relates to three products services then in one of these embodiments the viewer may select whether checkout is desired for all the related products services or an indicated subset of the three products services whereas in another of these embodiments checkout may be initiated for the product service corresponding to the currently playing segment of video 8. In the latter embodiment the mapping between the different segments of the video and the various associated products services discussed above may enable checkout component to determine the currently corresponding product service.

In some embodiments each time the video e commerce module puts a viewer in touch with a vendor for more information for example VOIP chat email callback and or results in a viewer buying a product service for example buy it now redirect or checkout via module the affiliate code of the affiliate from whose website the module was loaded onto client is transferred to the vendor. For example the affiliate code may be embedded in a link to the vendor or may be sent separately. In this way the vendor can appreciate and or compensate the affiliate for the contact sale. In one of these embodiments the affiliate is also informed when the viewer is put in touch with the vendor for more information and or buys a product service. For example in some cases buy it now redirects to the vendor and or other links to the vendor may be redirected via affiliate network system so that affiliate network system may follow up on disbursements of commissions to affiliates and or to affiliate network system etc. In another embodiment additionally or alternatively the video e commerce facilitator may provide the vendor and or affiliate with a consolidated report including instances that a viewer was put in touch with the vendor instances that a viewer bought a product service and or including other tracked information relating to a video e commerce module which was published on an affiliate website.

Print component allows the viewer to print what is currently being displayed on the video e commerce module. Advertisement banner allows a banner to be displayed within the video e commerce module.

Although mentioned above it is again emphasized to the reader that in other embodiments a video e commerce module may have less more and or different components than those discussed with reference to .

Referring again to method the actions of the video e commerce module which are executed automatically and or in reaction to viewer action may be tracked. The tracking is represented by stage although the tracking in some cases may take place in parallel to any stage of method for example stage etc. The tracking is performed by tracking engine . In one embodiment tracking engine is assisted by an API for example a web service.

Depending on the embodiment the tracking can be of varying degrees of comprehensiveness. For example in one embodiment only buy it now redirects and checkouts are tracked. As another example in one embodiment additionally or alternatively any action for which an affiliate or the video e commerce facilitator will be compensated by the vendor is tracked. In this example for actions where the affiliate is compensated the tracking data may in some cases need to include the affiliate code. As another example additionally or alternatively any action which requires an update of the data in data repository in some cases any of the following inter alia viewer inputted data such as comments tags reviews polls forms etc. tracking data which influences selection sequencing by selector etc is tracked. As another example additionally or alternatively actions by the viewer relating to the video which indicate enjoyment for example replay video save video or non enjoyment of the video for example skip to next video are tracked. As another example additionally or alternatively actions by the viewer which indicate that the video has caused the viewer to consider the associated product s service s are tracked for example viewer clicks on photos reviews comments details VOIP click to call IM live chat email to vendor click for callback or price comparison while a video is playing. As another example additionally or alternatively actions by the viewer which show that the video e commerce module is attractive are tracked for example grab code post module send to a friend. As another example additionally or alternatively viewer actions which affect how selector generates modifies or sequences a playlist are tracked. As another example additionally or alternatively the tracking may commence each time a module is loaded onto any client .

As mentioned above in some cases some of the information tracked by tracking engine may be saved in data repository . For example referring to the algorithm example of stage where buy it now checkout clicks and the number of times that a video is viewed affects the sequencing of the playlist tracking data relating to buy it now checkout clicks and video views are saved in data repository so that selector can execute the algorithm. As another example data inputted by the user such as comments tags polls reviews forms etc may be tracked and saved in data repository .

In stage reporting engine uses the tracked data to prepare reports. In one embodiment reporting engine is assisted by an API for example a web service. Reports can be used inter alia for reviewing the performance of the video e commerce module.

In one embodiment reporting engine produces reports according to rules set by the video e commerce facilitator. In another embodiment additionally or alternatively a user may configure the content and or format of the report for example via report configurator of publishing system . In some cases reports may be viewed after logging in. For example in some of these cases a vendor may only be allowed to view reports relating to products services thereof and or an affiliate may only be allowed to view reports relating to a video e commerce module published on the affiliate website thereof i.e. associated with the code of the affiliate . In some embodiments there may be different channels for a user to log in and view a report for example via report viewer of publishing system via a video e commerce module etc. In one of these embodiments where the log in is via a video e commerce module the module does not necessarily have to be associated with the user who is logging in i.e. a vendor does not have to have his products services on the module to log in through the module an affiliate may log in through a module on a web site of another affiliate etc In some of these embodiments the format and or content of the report may vary depending on the channel. For example in one of these embodiments only a summary report may be available via a video e commerce module whereas reports with differing levels of detail may be available via report viewer .

As can be seen from the description above many embodiments of the invention relate to technological methods systems and or computer readable mediums for video e commerce. However some embodiments of the present invention additionally or alternatively relate to incentives compensations and or opportunities which may in some cases facilitate video e commerce. In one of these embodiments an affiliate may be provided with a monetary incentive to publish the video e commerce module. Possible monetary incentives are not limited by the invention. For example in some cases the affiliate may receive a percentage of sales transactions completed within the published video e commerce module checkout via module sales transactions resulting from redirecting the viewer to the web site of the vendor via the module buy it now redirect and or sale transactions resulting from requests for information from the vendor via the e commerce module e.g. chat email VOIP callback etc . Continuing with this example in some cases the compensation may only be for sales completed within a predetermined period from the time the viewer clicked on buy it now or requested information from the vendor. As another example additionally or alternatively in some cases the affiliate may receive compensation for other actions of a viewer of the module for example each time the viewer requests to be put in touch with the vendor for more information e.g. VOIP chat email callback . As another example in some cases there may be a higher level of compensation for an affiliate who created the catalog and included playlist for the published module versus an affiliate who selected a pre existing catalog playlist or had selector create the catalog playlist. In some cases affiliate network system also receives compensation when an affiliate which selected the module via affiliate network system gets compensated.

In one of these embodiments in order for the affiliate and optionally affiliate system to be compensated the disburser of the compensation for example the vendor and or facilitator may in some cases need to be aware of the identity of the affiliate. For this reason the affiliate code which was associated with the video e commerce module in stage may in some cases be important. In some cases the affiliate and or affiliate network system may be compensated by the vendor based on data which the vendor is aware of without reviewing a report by reporting engine although this does not preclude a report of the data also being generated by reporting engine . For example it is possible that in one embodiment a vendor may compensate the affiliate and or affiliate system for sales ensuing from buy it now redirects or ensuing from requests for information via the e commerce module e.g. chat email VOIP callback etc . In this example the buy it now redirect email VOIP callback or chat initiated by the module may cause code of the affiliate to be provided to the vendor for example because the code is embedded in the link to the vendor or otherwise so that the vendor can compensate the correct affiliate and or affiliate system for any resulting sales. In this example the operations such as the buy it now redirect email VOIP callback or chat initiated by the module may in some cases also be indicated to the affiliate and or affiliate system for example by having a link or separate communication of the code to the vendor pass via the affiliate and or affiliate system through feedback from the module and or via a report prepared by reporting engine . In another embodiment additionally or alternatively compensation of affiliates and or affiliate network system may be based on reports generated by reporting engine .

In one of these embodiments the facilitator is compensated by the vendor. Possible compensation schemes are not limited by the invention. For example in some cases the facilitator may be compensated for any of the following inter alia views of videos products services buy it now redirect clicks checkout via module clicks IM live chat clicks emails to vendor VOIP clicks to call clicks for callback percentages on sales completed via checkout percentages on sales resulting from buy it now redirect etc.

In one of these embodiments the vendor has the opportunity to transact more sales because the offered product service is displayed on affiliate web site s . It is important to note that the usage of video typically provides a compelling presentation of the associated product service and therefore attracts a viewer to purchase the product service. In an embodiment where the catalog and included playlist is customized to the affiliate website and or viewer there is a more targeted presentation of products services and therefore in some cases it may be more likely that the viewer will be presented with a product service which interests him or her. In an embodiment where checkout is completed within the video e commerce module the viewer may in some cases be less likely to abort the transaction than if redirected to another site to complete the transaction.

From the description above the reader will understand that in some cases the catalog which is embodied e.g. expressed and or stored on a computer readable medium is an item which can potentially be bought and sold due to its valuable contribution to video e commerce. Even though in some embodiments of the invention the catalog may be provided to another party without payment for the catalog per se this fact does not detract from the valuable nature of the catalog.

The reader will also understand from the description above that in some cases the video e commerce module is an item which could potentially be bought and sold due to its valuable contribution to video e commerce. Even though in some embodiments of the invention the module may be provided to another party without payment for the module per se this fact does not detract from the valuable nature of the module. As mentioned above the video e commerce module may be made up of any combination of software hardware and or firmware capable of performing the functions defined and explained herein. For example in some cases the video e commerce module may be embodied on a computer readable medium.

It will also be understood that in some embodiments the system according to the invention may be a suitably programmed computer. Likewise some embodiments of the invention contemplate a computer program being readable by a computer for executing the method of the invention. Some embodiments of the invention further contemplate a machine readable memory tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine for executing the method of the invention.

While the invention has been shown and described with respect to particular embodiments it is not thus limited. Numerous modifications changes and improvements within the scope of the invention will now occur to the reader.
