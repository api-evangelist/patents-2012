No. 60 406 032 filed Aug. 27 2002. The disclosure of these prior applications and patents are considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.

The present invention relates in general to the field of data security and more particularly to providing data security to mobile devices.

Recent advances in hardware and communication technologies have brought about the proliferation of powerful mobile devices ranging from notebook computers to much smaller personal digital assistants PDAs that operate over wired and wireless networks. These mobile devices also known as handheld devices operate on various platforms such as palm computing platform Windows CE etc. Other types of mobile devices include paging and messaging devices laptop computers data capable smart phones etc. These devices can provide users with network access connectivity which allows users to be quickly notified of changing events and provide them with the resources necessary to respond even when in transit. In this way users can be given the power to access mission critical information in quick and reliable manner. For example data generated by client applications running on a wide variety of mobile devices may be transported over networks having various access protocols and wired and wireless links. One such protocol is Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP which is designed to connect computer systems that use different operating systems and network technologies. Many popular network applications have been built directly on top of the TCP over the past decade making TCP IP a de facto network access protocol standard.

Many personal computer users use Personal Information Management PIM applications such as an address book a daily organizer and a To Do list application on their personal computers and mobile devices. The data for these PIMS are stored in corresponding databases at the personal computers and mobile devices. Often data in these databases must be synchronized in order to maintain data uniformity. The synchronization of data between devices of this type is known. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 006 274 describes a Method and Apparatus Using a Pass Through Personal Computer Connected to Both a Local Communication Link and a Computer Network for Identifying and Synchronizing a Preferred Computer with a Portable Computer . Also U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 000 000 and 5 884 323 both describe an Extendible Method and Apparatus for Synchronizing Multiple Files on Two Different Computer Systems. Generally the synchronization process is activated either by detecting a mobile device on a cradle or by manual press of a button. The synchronization process proceeds to synchronize data for several different applications that run on the mobile devices with data for corresponding application on other computers.

As society continues to adopt handheld devices as a standard computing platform and applications become more powerful with the standardization of wired and wireless computing security threats to data stored in these types of mobile devices have become a serious concern and have created a heightened awareness and increased need for security. In fact the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL which develops some of the government s most advanced technologies is crafting a policy to deal with security risks for data stored in mobile devices.

Various types of security software incorporating different data security encryption standards have been used in the past for securing network desktop laptop and PDA environments. On such suit of software is called Trusted Mobility Suite offered by Trust Digital which is used to set access control encryption and other parameters and push them to such mobile devices as Palm Pilot PocketPC Blackberry or Symbian OS devices to protect against fraud and theft sabotage malicious hacking and other adverse exposure caused by data compromise. For example at a network level PDASecure Virtual Private Network provides secure communication among mobile devices or between mobile devices and routers and servers. Mobile DesktopSecure is a security and encryption software designed to protect files data applications databases directories or an entire hard drive. It is also used to push security profiles containing defined security policies from a server to protect laptops and desktops within a network. Generally Trusted Mobility Suite implements security using a graphical user interface GUI that allows administrators and users to secure all or selected applications. In this way the users and administrators can selectively secure application s from unwanted and unauthorized access.

Trusted Mobility Suite manages data security for mobile devices at different levels. At a higher server level Trusted Mobility Server deploys manages and secures networks containing mobile devices using a centralized management solution. A policy profile editor is used to set security parameters for groups of users based on defined security policies. At a lower device level PDASecure encrypts the data on the mobile device itself and offers security management for those devices through the Trust Mobility Server. Once installed on a mobile device PDASecure provides for universal integration with all available mobile devices on the network without the requirement for moving data into separate secured applications. Also Trusted Mobility Software Development Kit allows software developers to incorporate Trust Digital s Mobility Framework comprising security encryption and centralized rule based management technologies into their products for mobile PDA users.

Also U.S. Pat. No. 6 158 010 discloses a system and method for maintaining security in a distributed computing environment that comprises a policy manager located on a server for managing and distributing a security policy and an application guard located on a client for managing access to securable components as specified by the security policy. A global policy specifies access privileges of the user to securable components. The policy manager may then preferably distribute a local client policy based on the global policy to the client. An application guard located on the client then manages access to the securable components as specified by the local policy.

Implementation of comprehensive security policies in networks that supports large number of mobile devices has become an important issue for many enterprises particularly in view of complexities associated with supporting various hardware and software platforms in terms of network architectures protocols device types etc. Add to this complexity the various situations under which data security may be breached either on the network side or on the device side. Additionally due to availability of limited memory and processing resources creating security programs for mobile devices is much more complicated than that of larger computers. Therefore there exists a need for an efficient and flexible system and method for securing data in mobile devices used under varying operating environments.

The system and method for securing data in mobile devices of the present invention includes a computing node and a plurality of mobile devices as later defined below. A node security program or agent executed in the computing node interfaces with a device security program executed at a mobile device if one exists or interface with device resources. The node security program or agent can also interface with a node security program executed at another computing node. The computing node or alternatively a security server can be responsible for sending information and created profiles to other devices nodes or agents and for controlling the flow of information and data with devices nodes or agents.

The node security program interprets a node security profile to control data synchronization data transfer data query data collection file and program access and execution or device discovery as further described below in connection with one or more mobile devices or other external resource discovery for example external storage discovery like USB flash cards and memory. For example the node security program can prevent synchronization of data between the mobile device and the computing node if not authorized in accordance with the node security profile information. Also the node security program can prevent the mobile device from collecting data run programs and access files from a connected network. The node security program can also prevent any resource on the network or computing node to access resources files execute program collect and query data on the mobile device if not authorized in accordance with the security profile information.

The information contained in the node security profile can be used to determine whether a client station acting as a computing node is authorized to transfer a device security profile that sets the security parameters for a mobile device. If authorized the device security profile is transferred or otherwise copies from the computing node to the mobile device. A device security program which is executed in the mobile device interprets the device security profile for example as an .ini or XML file to set the transferred security parameters for the mobile devices. If not authorized the node security program can lock the unauthorized mobile device for example by transmitting a device security application to be executed at the unauthorized mobile device among other things. The device security profile can lock the device for usage disable IR beam Bluetooth networking sound and voice information.

The node and device security profiles can define the security parameters in accordance with a defined security policy. As such the device and or node security profiles can be created at a central station such as a server station using a policy editor program. The security policy can also be created maintained and enforced at the computing nodes or mobile devices. The created device and node security profiles can be transferred to the computing node or the mobile devices over a network using a push technology for example. Alternatively upon request a pull technology may be used for example in a wired wireless network to transfer the node and device security profiles to wired wireless mobile devices and computing nodes. Under any one of these arrangements the computing node security profile and the device security profile can be updated periodically by checking one or more designated web sites or accessing a central station or server station for example LDAP Active database file directory repository. In a similar manner the device security profile can be updated by accessing the computing node or accessing a central station or server station. Also more than one security profiles can be created transferred and stored on the mobile device.

Another aspect of the present invention is a discovery system and method for managing a computer network which involves scanning the network based on a scan profile to locate one or more mobile devices or device types belonging to the network. For example the scan profile can contain information regarding at least one of network domain and computer identity to be scanned. In the discovery process of the invention a node computing node IP address or domain can be either included or excluded from being scanned. As such the scan profile can contain information regarding at least one of network domain and computer identity not to be scanned. The type of the located mobile device is determined based on entries in an application registry synchronization log directory structure a database or other protocols for example SNMP. The mobile device type information gathered through the discovery process can be used for managing security in the computer network. The located mobile devices can be grouped by type domain IP address for reporting and display purposes identifying welcomed and un welcomed mobile device as well as risk and vulnerability status.

Referring to an exemplary system that advantageously implements the present invention in a network is shown. The system of the invention supports security amongst computing nodes and mobile devices which are also referred to as user devices. The computing nodes can be any type of wired or wireless network node a client station connected to a security application server directly or via a network . The computing node can also be a standalone computer. The mobile devices can be of any type. Under one feature of the present invention various types of mobile devices operating within the system can be discovered located or detected for managing security. For example the present invention can support any handheld device personal digital assistant phone smart phone pager etc.

Under the present invention various types of data files and profiles can be transferred between the computing nodes and mobile devices over any supported transport layer link or physical connection. The transport protocol can be any suitable protocol including TCP IP various telephony transport protocols etc. The links can be wired or wireless links . The wired links can be twisted pair coaxial cable optical cable etc. As described later in more detail the wireless links can support any number of over the air protocols.

In an exemplary embodiment the system of the invention is implemented over a network that includes server stations client stations and a host or central station either directly or via any collection of interconnected public and or private networks that are linked together by a set of standard or proprietary protocols. The system of the present invention can also support various wireless links with defined protocols. Examples of such protocols include any one of IEEE 802.X GSM IS 136 IS 95 Bluetooth etc.

The present invention may also be implemented over the Internet a distributed network that supports the World Wide Web Web . The Web refers generally to both i a distributed collection of inter linked user viewable hypertext documents that are accessible via the Internet and ii the user and server software components which provide user access to such documents using standardized Internet protocols. A Web Site is a computer system that serves informational content over a Network using the standard protocols of the World Wide Web. Typically a Web site corresponds to a particular Internet domain name and includes the content associated with a particular organization.

As shown in the security application server can access a security database which stores various data including security profiles for the computing nodes and mobile devices . The database can also store collected and discovered information from computing nodes and mobile devices including event log and audit log information etc. The security applications server communicates with such devices through a network layer interface . The network used in connection with the present invention can use any one of open or proprietary network standards. In a preferred embodiment the system interconnections are based on an open system interconnection OSI model as proposed by the International Standards Organization ISO .

It should be noted that the present invention need not be implemented over a network. In fact the present invention can use a computing node alone or as a part of a network as long as it possesses the processing power to execute programs and applications in accordance with the present invention. When the computing node is not connected to any network the mobile device access between the computing node and the mobile device is an off line access.

Referring to a block diagram for managing security between the computing node mobile devices and the resource device is shown. A node security program or agent is executed in the computing node for interfacing with a corresponding device security program or agent executed at the mobile device or resource device . The mobile device security is dictated by a device security profile that is interpreted by the device security program . The node security program interprets a node security profile to determine one or more security parameters for managing the security between the computing node resource device and mobile devices including controlling transfer of data files device profiles applications and programs between the computing node resource device and the mobile devices . For example the security parameters derived from interpreting the node security profile may require preventing data synchronization between one or both of the mobile device and resource device . The computing node acts as a single point communication gateway between the mobile devices and other network resources . One such resource can be a storage device e.g. a USB enabled flash or SD card. Such resources can include a synchronization program. The node security profile can enable the computing node security program to monitor scan query accept deny password protect a request to create maintain terminate modify a communication link or activity. Based on security parameters determined by interpreting the node security profile the node security program can prevent remote execution utilization of any application or file on the mobile device or resources . Based on the determined security parameters the computing node security program can enable or disable synchronizing particular kind of data. For example the interpreted security parameters can specify that address book data cannot be synchronized.

As such the security parameter can relates to authorizing synchronization with the computing node or other types of transfer of data files and programs applications between the computing node and devices and . The information contained in the node security profile can include information that alone or in combination identify an authorized or unauthorized computing node an authorized or unauthorized user an authorized or unauthorized mobile device an authorized or unauthorized central station or an authorized or unauthorized network or resource such as an external storage devices. The identity may be specified by physical address serial number model number device type server or a network resource ID software license number registration number user ID etc. The authorized or unauthorized computing node can be specified relative to mobile device parameters such as device type etc. For example certain computing nodes may be authorized to synchronize data with certain specified mobile device types but not authorized to synchronize data with other device types and vice versa.

The computing node manages all aspect of data file application and device profile transfer acting as a gateway for all types of device security management. Among other things the computing node is responsible for control of mobile device data in to and out of the computing node based on security parameters contained in the node security profile .

As stated above the computing node can be any type of wired or wireless network node including a client station connected to the security server directly or via a wired or wireless network. In its simplest form the computing node can be a standalone computer station. Also the computing node can itself be a mobile device that is responsible for managing security for other mobile devices . As stated above the security parameters of the computing node is defined by the node security profile . For example the node security profile can set user access rights by enabling disabling or password protecting users ability to configure the computing node and or its profile. Depending upon the security parameters set in the node security profile corresponding changes are made to the registry key file or database entries of the computing node or its configuration file to enforce the node security profile parameters. Registry key file or database entries along with functionality associated with the computing node are used to control and monitor all data synchronization transfer access modification or execution of files applications programs. profiles e.g. security profiles and processes that occur through the computing node by any data transport that relates to applications that synchronize data with the devices and . The computing node security program can also check for example periodically for security profile updates.

Under another arrangement the computing node security program can be deployed for a given IP range network domain or user list automatically. For example the security server can detect and identify the computing nodes that do not have or execute corresponding node security programs within an IP range network domain or user list. Once such determination is made the server can automatically transmit the node security programs to the so detected IP range network domain or user list.

The computing node profile can also have a validation life span that could indicate a time frame that the profile can be used or applied. This life span can be indefinite meaning that it can be used at any time or can have a range of date and time.

In contrast with the node security profile which sets the computing node security parameters the device security profile sets the security parameters for the devices and as interpreted by the device security programs . The device security parameters include encryption preferences global device password local application or resource password access control to applications and resources access control to the device integrity protection against hackers and traps file encryption options port protection communication protection i.e. send and receive ability to use wireless connections like Wi Fi 802.11 Bluetooth controlling the content of the device like restricting installing of some applications etc.

In one embodiment of the invention the information contained in the node security profile can be used to determine whether the computing node is authorized to transfer a device security profile to a mobile device . For example upon a request initiated by the mobile device when it connects it to the computing nodes . If the computing node is an authorized computing node as further described below upon request the device security profile is copied from the computing node to the mobile device using an established wired or wireless link. Alternatively upon connection or detection of connection to a security policy repository server or computing node the mobile device can request creation of a device security profile in real time bases or query to determine whether a device security profile has been created for it at any time in past to be utilized when requested.

The device security program executed in the mobile device interprets the transferred device security profile as an .ini or XML file for example to set the transferred security parameters for the mobile device . If the computing node is not authorized the node security program can lock the mobile device for example by transmitting a device security application to be executed at the unauthorized mobile device wipe or erase data on the device or require system administrator intervention among other things. Both the device and node security profiles can be any type of file that can be interpreted by corresponding device and node security programs for example a text or .ini file or a binary file or XML file.

According to another feature of the present invention the device security is also controlled temporarily in terms of time for example based on year month day hour minute. The device security can also be based on location as determined by any one of well known positioning or location determination techniques. Under this arrangement device security profiles can be created dynamically based on time and or location of the device. The created profiles can be transferred to the devices or using any one of over the air protocols for example. The security profiles node or device can be pre loaded and activated as needed. Under another arrangement the device security program can be deployed for a given IP range network domain or user list or synchronization ID automatically. For example the security server or computing node can detect and identify mobile devices that do not have or execute corresponding device security programs within the IP range network domain or user list. Once such determination is made the node security program can automatically transmit the device security programs to the so detected IP range network domain user list or synchronization ID.

Under another arrangement the computing node profile has a validation life span that could indicate a time frame that the profile can be used or applied. This life span can be indefinite meaning that it can be used at any time or can have a range of date and time.

Under another arrangement multiple device profile can be loaded stored and transferred to the mobile device resources. Only one profile can be loaded and active at a time. The appropriate profile can become active based on time day date location or device sensing equipment. For example as soon as the mobile device is moved to a secure location an external device sends appropriate signals to the mobile device to active a different device profile.

A node or device security profile or defines one or more security features used for providing various security quality features and characteristics within the computer system of the present invention. The security profiles can be created at the central station the server station or at a computing node . As stated above the node security profile defines the parameters for managing security in accordance with the present invention. The node security profile is interpreted by the node security program to determine the security parameters. The present invention can use any suitable tool for creating security profiles that have defined interpretation rules such those that govern .ini or XML files. The security profiles can be edited using corresponding editing tools. If the security profile is a text profile for example a text editor can be used for creating the node profile. The security profile can also be a binary or XML file interpreted by the node security program or agent based on defined rules.

The security of system can be managed based on a centrally promulgated security policy. Such security policy can be defined for a network or a public or private institution such as corporations schools governmental agencies etc. In one embodiment the security profile can be created by running an editor program shown in which is designed to create security profiles based on a defined security policy. The created node security profiles can be transferred to one or more computing nodes over a network for example using a push or pull technology. The transfer of the security profiles can be relative to an IP range a subnet mask or a network domain name. A pull technology may be used for example in a wireless network to transfer node and device security profiles to wireless mobile devices and computing nodes upon request. Under any one of these arrangements the computing node security profile and the device security profile can be updated periodically by checking one or more designated web ftp sites or accessing a central station or server station. In a similar manner the device security profile can be updated by accessing the computing node . The device security program can also automatically request device security profile in real time.

The present invention provides security under various environments including 1 securing one multiple mobile devices that synchronize with a single computing node for example through a cradle 2 securing a single mobile device that synchronizes with multiple local computing nodes for example multiple client stations 3 securing a mobile device that synchronizes with a remote computing node such as a server across a network using a local computing node such as a client station and 4 securing a mobile device synchronizing with a remote computing node through a wired or wireless network. The present invention handles each different environment appropriately with minimal user interaction.

In its simplest form the system of the invention comprises a mobile device coupled to a computing node which is a standalone computer station. The coupling is through a connection of the computer station and a mobile device cradle that is used for data synchronization between the mobile device and the computing node . A user drops the mobile device into the cradle and activates a button to initiate synchronization. The button activation causes a synchronization program on the mobile device to be executed in accordance with security parameters defined b the node security profile . For example the node security profile can define the ability to block not to block to prevent to allow to password protect to enable or to disable the synchronization operation data transfer operations to be performed as well as applications and data to be used during synchronization.

As shown in other computers such as server and client stations can also be coupled to the network. The mobile devices can synchronize either with a local computing node or a remote computing node across the network. Once the security of provisions is verified the synchronization program on the mobile device works with a peer synchronization program on the computing node.

According to this feature of the invention computing nodes can be designated as authorized or unauthorized synchronization stations within an environment. A system administrator can designate specific computing nodes as authorized for one or more users or group of users but unauthorized for other users or group of users. For example the administrator can restrict certain users from synchronizing on stations located in a defined room or area. Similarly the administrator can allow specific computing nodes to be used as authorized synchronization stations. This allows for better implementation of security and to insure unauthorized access to data by synchronizing on different unauthorized systems does not take place.

The node security profile defines the parameters for synchronization actions that can or cannot be performed on the computing node. The list of authorized computing nodes can be displayed on nodes or servers. A computing node can be enabled disabled as a synchronization station as required based on administration request or real time request from other resources. The device security profile stored on the mobile devices can also include parameters for managing synchronization between the mobile device and the computing node.

According to another aspect of the invention a discovery process is used to discover detect or locate mobile devices resources based on specified discovery rules. Various methods can be used to detect and discover the mobile devices or resource devices . The discovery of the mobile devices can be done remotely or locally. Remote discovery can be within a network that comprises domains with each domain including a number of computing nodes. Under this arrangement the discovery detection and location of the mobile devices resources can be controlled by a central discovery program or agent for example one that runs at the security server . Also the discovery method of the present invention can be a local discovery process where the mobile devices are discovered or detected locally at a computing node by running a discovery agent in the computing node locally as opposed to a centrally. The discovery process can detect and track how a mobile device or external resource is sued and on which systems a particular resource or mobile device has synchronized data. The discovery can also detect foreign and unknown devices that have not been attached to the network earlier entering a wired or wireless network of an organization.

The scan profile can contain information regarding at least one of network domain and computing node identity to be scanned. Alternatively the scan profile can contain information regarding at least one of network domain and computing node identity not to be scanned. The discovery program scans the domains or computing nodes based on the scan profile to discover detect or locate the mobile devices e.g. based on a domain identity. Thus the scan profile defines the parameters for connecting to domains computing nodes and mobile devices.

In a remote discovery process the discovery program running on the central station on server detects the domains of the network. After detecting the domains local and or remote the computing nodes within the domain are detected by attempts to establish corresponding connections to the computing nodes. Depending on the computing node the connections can be authenticated or unauthenticated. If an attempt to establish an unauthenticated connection is not successful an attempt is made to establish authenticated connection. The connection with each computing node can be authenticated using known authentication features such as a set of password for example the last used password to access the computing node. If authentication using the last used password is not successful pre defined or selected passwords can be used to access the resources. If no valid password is available the administrator may be asked to perform password authentication. Once the authenticated or unauthenticated connection is made the computing node is accessed to detect mobile devices or resources.

Information regarding discovered detected or located mobile device or resources is determined based on any one of a registry resource a file resource a process resource a network management parameter a communication protocol parameter a data format a packet format a synchronization log entry a directory structure or a database entry. For example the application registries on the computing node can be interrogated to determine what type of devices has attached to the node. More specifically registry resources are processed to detect device type in terms of whether the detected mobile device is a Palm Nokia Research in Motion RIM or Windows CE device. The mobile devices or external resources can leave an imprint in the registry structure any time they attach to a computing node. The imprint is not erased when a device disconnects. Thus any device that has attached to the computing node at any time in the past can be detected and identified. Alternatively the devices can be identified based on connecting to local and remote processes objects and process requests or connecting to remote drives file objects etc.

Also determined are information regarding previous synchronization information such as data and time stamp of last synchronization the type of device used during previous synchronization synchronization ID. Moreover information regarding device owner can also be determined by the discovery process of the present invention including e.g. name address company etc. Still other determined information include type applications and files installed or used on the mobile device with file size file name file attribute and manufacturer information time stamp of all completed and incomplete synchronization and data access and connections performed or made as well as the type of data and information transferred to and from mobile device and other resources relative to the computing node.

Also network management parameters such as those defined by the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP can be used to locate detect and discover the types of the mobile devices or resources that have attached to the computing node. Also the data and packet format as well as associated transport and network protocol parameters e.g. TCP UDP and IP can be used to locate detect or discover the type of mobile devices. Such mobile device type information is used for managing security in the computer network. By processing any of the gathered information the discovery system and method of the present invention provides an effective management tool for managing all security aspects of any computer system An exemplary report derived from gathered information by the discovery method of the invention is shown in .

Under another arrangement mobile devices or resources are discovered by a discovery program or agent that runs on the server only when the mobile devices connect to the computing node or using registry file and process resources as explained above. Under yet another arrangement the discovery program runs as an agent in the computing node. The 3 discovery agent in the computing node thus can discover and control unwelcomed devices and resources based on a node security profile which defines synchronization and data transfer rules. The detected discovery data can be stored in secure files and transferred to the security server for processing.

The discovery rules for detecting or locating the mobile devices or resources can be either hard coded in the software or defined as a discovery or scan profile. Such profiles can be updated on demand manually or automatically as required to get an updated discovery or scan profile.

An SDK provides programming interface to allow the software developers the ability to integrate the present invention with the other platform provided with the system.

The security system of the present invention can be implemented using defined application programming interfaces APIs . APIs are contained in a library as a set of software functions that perform various security tasks. Also defined are the structures and parameters needed to correctly call these public functions.

The SDK would help any third party developer to develop security solutions. It eliminates the need to write the encryption libraries from scratch. The input and output parameters of these API calls are clearly defined so that they can be easily embedded in any existing source code. The SDK also helps in providing customized solutions to unique problems encountered by the customers.
