This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 444 891 filed Feb. 21 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference.

This application is generally related to fabricating an implantable lead by employing confocal displacement optical imaging to control laser ablation operations.

Implantable cardiac therapy devices ICTDs enjoy widespread use for providing convenient portable sustained therapy for cardiac patients with a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. ICTDs may combine a pacemaker and defibrillator in a single implantable device. Such devices may be configured to provide ongoing cardiac pacing in order to maintain an appropriate cardiac rhythm. In addition should the ICTD detect that the patient is experiencing an episode of ventricular fibrillation or an episode of ventricular tachycardia the ICTD can deliver appropriate defibrillation therapy.

Cardiac rhythm management CRM therapies require not only an ICTD but also the placement of electrical leads threaded through blood vessels and typically into the heart itself. Patients with implanted electrical leads benefit from leads which exhibit optimized properties in terms of size that is minimal lead width or diameter flexibility strength and reliability including resistance to breaking and various electrical properties such as low impedance in order to carry large current loads .

With advances in both CRM therapy and ICTD technologies the device implant pathway can become busy with three or more cables for example cables may be required for treating bradycardia tachycardia defibrillation cardiac pacing for standalone sensors etc. . These multiple leads may need to be placed inside only one or two veins which in turn benefit from smaller size leads to ensure adequate circulation through the blood vessels. Adding new sensor based diagnostic features such as LAP left atrial pressure RVP right ventricular pressure and SvO blood oxygen sensor requires creating additional space in the implant pathway or the lead body for the diagnostic circuits. Therefore the addition of such sensors requires that the regular ICD lead diameter again must be reduced. Potential target drug delivery and target biological therapy delivery of tissues cells antibodies genes etc. needs to be specifically delivered via a lead channel in the given vein with the new ICD leads. All of these therapeutic demands create requirements for the thinnest possible leads consistent with other lead requirements flexibility durability low electrical resistance and others .

With recent advances in cardiac therapies alternative ICD lead implant sites are increasingly used. These include the right ventricular outflow tract ROT the right ventricular RV high septum and other sites in the right heart and also the cardiac septum CS the great cardiac vein and other areas of the left heart. To this end the ICD leads must be robust and flexible for site specific positioning and for ease of implantation through the torturous and complex implant pathways. ICTD leads also require improved acute and chronic stability at the desired site to reliably deliver the desired therapies for the entire design life of the system.

The various operational requirements for ICTD leads create competing design requirements. In general thinner leads contribute to flexibility and allow for maximum circulation within blood vessels. However thinner leads present other technical complexities including fabrication difficulties and expense.

It will be noted that while implantable leads are essential in the field of cardiac rhythm management CRM therapies implantable leads are employed in many other biomedical applications as well. For example implantable leads have applications in neurology for treatment of Parkinson s disease epilepsy chronic pain and other many other conditions. Many of the requirements identified above such as small size i.e. being as thin as possible flexibility durability and low resistance are important for these other applications as well.

In one embodiment a method of fabrication an implantable lead for providing electrical pulses to tissue of a patient the method comprises i providing a sheath of transparent insulative material wherein the sheath comprises a plurality of lumens ii scanning across the sheath with a confocal displacement meter to generate displacement data iii processing the displacement data in software executed on a computer system to generate a representation of an exterior surface and lumens of the sheath iv automatically selecting locations in software executed on a computer system on the exterior surface for application of laser pulses to create apertures in the sheath that provide access to respective lumens of the sheath and v applying laser pulses according to the sheath to create the apertures.

The foregoing has outlined rather broadly certain features and or technical advantages in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood. Additional features and or advantages will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The novel features both as to organization and method of operation together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood however that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the appended claims.

Before describing in detail the methods and systems for fabricating implantable leads it is helpful to describe an example environment. The methods and systems described herein may be particularly useful for implantable leads for use in the environment of an implantable cardiac therapy device ICTD .

An ICTD is a physiologic measuring device and therapeutic device that is implanted in a patient to monitor cardiac function and to deliver appropriate electrical therapy for example pacing pulses cardioverting and defibrillator pulses and drug therapy as required. ICTDs include for example and without limitation pacemakers cardioverters defibrillators implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantable cardiac rhythm management devices and the like. Such devices may also be used in particular to monitor cardiac electrical activity and to analyze cardiac electrical activity. The term implantable cardiac therapy device or simply ICTD is used herein to refer to any such implantable cardiac device.

The techniques described below are intended to be implemented in connection with any ICTD or any similar stimulation device that is configured or configurable to stimulate nerves throughout a patient s body and or stimulate and or shock a patient s heart.

The right atrial lead as the name implies is positioned in and or passes through a patient s right atrium. The right atrial lead optionally senses atrial cardiac signals and or provide right atrial chamber stimulation therapy.

For example an exemplary coronary sinus lead includes pacing electrodes capable of delivering pacing pulses to a patient s left ventricle and at least one electrode capable of stimulating an autonomic nerve. An exemplary coronary sinus lead or left ventricular lead or left atrial lead may also include at least one electrode capable of stimulating an autonomic nerve such an electrode may be positioned on the lead or a bifurcation or leg of the lead.

Stimulation device is also shown in electrical communication with the patient s heart by way of an implantable right ventricular lead having in this exemplary implementation a right ventricular tip electrode a right ventricular ring electrode a right ventricular RV coil electrode and a superior vena cava SVC coil electrode . Typically the right ventricular lead is transvenously inserted into the heart to place the right ventricular tip electrode in the right ventricular apex so that the RV coil electrode will be positioned in the right ventricle and the SVC coil electrode will be positioned in the superior vena cava. Accordingly the right ventricular lead is capable of sensing or receiving cardiac signals and delivering stimulation in the form of pacing and shock therapy to the right ventricle. An exemplary right ventricular lead may also include at least one electrode capable of stimulating an autonomic nerve such an electrode may be positioned on the lead or a bifurcation or leg of the lead.

An implantable cardiac therapy device may be referred to variously and equivalently throughout this document as an implantable cardiac therapy device an ICTD an implantable device a stimulation device and the respective plurals thereof.

Housing for stimulation device is often referred to as the can case or case electrode and may be programmably selected to act as the return electrode for all unipolar modes. Housing may further be used as a return electrode alone or in combination with one or more of the coil electrodes and see for shocking purposes. Housing further includes a connector not shown having a plurality of terminals shown schematically and for convenience the names of the electrodes to which they are connected are shown next to the terminals .

The type of microcontroller is not critical to the described implementations. Rather any suitable microcontroller may be used that carries out the functions described herein. The use of microprocessor based control circuits for performing timing and data analysis functions are well known in the art.

Microcontroller further includes an arrhythmia detector a morphology detector and optionally an orthostatic compensator and a minute ventilation MV response module the latter two are not shown in . These components can be utilized by the stimulation device for determining desirable times to administer various therapies including those to reduce the effects of orthostatic hypotension. The aforementioned components may be implemented in hardware as part of the microcontroller or as software firmware instructions programmed into the device and executed on the microcontroller during certain modes of operation.

Microcontroller further includes an AA delay AV delay and or VV delay module for performing a variety of tasks related to AA delay AV delay and or VV delay. This component can be utilized by the stimulation device for determining desirable times to administer various therapies including but not limited to ventricular stimulation therapy bi ventricular stimulation therapy resynchronization therapy atrial stimulation therapy etc. The AA AV VV module may be implemented in hardware as part of the microcontroller or as software firmware instructions programmed into the device and executed on the microcontroller during certain modes of operation. Of course such a module may be limited to one or more of the particular functions of AA delay AV delay and or VV delay. Such a module may include other capabilities related to other functions that may be germane to the delays. Such a module may help make determinations as to fusion.

The microcontroller of also includes an activity module . This module may include control logic for one or more activity related features. For example the module may include an algorithm for determining patient activity level calling for an activity test calling for a change in one or more pacing parameters etc. The module may be implemented in hardware as part of the microcontroller or as software firmware instructions programmed into the device and executed on the microcontroller during certain modes of operation. The module may act cooperatively with the AA AV VV module .

Microcontroller may also include a battery control module . Battery control module may be used for example to control a battery . Battery control may be hardwired circuitry or may be implemented as software or firmware running on microcontroller . Battery control may be coupled to battery via battery signal line and battery control line . Battery signal line may deliver to battery control status or operational information regarding battery . Battery control line may be used to change an operational state of battery . For example battery control line may deliver control signals from battery control to battery .

In an alternative embodiment battery control may be a separate module from microcontroller but may be coupled to microcontroller . For example separate module battery control may obtain required ICTD operational status information from microcontroller . Or for example separate module battery control may report battery status or battery operational information to microcontroller . In addition separate module battery control may also be coupled to battery .

In an alternative embodiment battery control may be implemented as an internal physical module of battery for example battery control may be implemented as a microchip which is situated internally to the exterior housing of battery . However battery control may still be coupled to microcontroller via battery signal line and battery control line . In an alternative embodiment battery control functions of battery control may be distributed across a first module which is part of battery and one or more additional modules which are external to battery . The battery control module s external to battery may for example be part of microcontroller .

The electrode configuration switch includes a plurality of switches for connecting the desired electrodes to the appropriate I O circuits thereby providing complete electrode programmability. Accordingly switch in response to a control signal from the microcontroller determines the polarity of the stimulation pulses e.g. unipolar bipolar combipolar etc. by selectively closing the appropriate combination of switches not shown as is known in the art.

Atrial sensing circuits and ventricular sensing circuits may also be selectively coupled to the right atrial lead coronary sinus lead and the right ventricular lead through the switch for detecting the presence of cardiac activity in each of the four chambers of the heart. Accordingly the atrial ATR.SENSE and ventricular VTR. SENSE sensing circuits and may include dedicated sense amplifiers multiplexed amplifiers or shared amplifiers. Switch determines the sensing polarity of the cardiac signal by selectively closing the appropriate switches as is also known in the art. In this way the clinician may program the sensing polarity independent of the stimulation polarity. The sensing circuits e.g. and are optionally capable of obtaining information indicative of tissue capture.

Each sensing circuit and preferably employs one or more low power precision amplifiers with programmable gain and or automatic gain control bandpass filtering and a threshold detection circuit as known in the art to selectively sense the cardiac signal of interest. The automatic gain control enables the device to deal effectively with the difficult problem of sensing the low amplitude signal characteristics of atrial or ventricular fibrillation.

The outputs of the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits and are connected to the microcontroller which in turn is able to trigger or inhibit the atrial and ventricular pulse generators and respectively in a demand fashion in response to the absence or presence of cardiac activity in the appropriate chambers of the heart. Furthermore as described herein the microcontroller is also capable of analyzing information output from the sensing circuits and and or the analog to digital A D data acquisition system to determine or detect whether and to what degree tissue capture has occurred and to program a pulse or pulses in response to such determinations. The sensing circuits and in turn receive control signals over signal lines and from the microcontroller for purposes of controlling the gain threshold polarization charge removal circuitry not shown and the timing of any blocking circuitry not shown coupled to the inputs of the sensing circuits and as is known in the art.

For arrhythmia detection the device utilizes the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits and to sense cardiac signals to determine whether a rhythm is physiologic or pathologic. In reference to arrhythmias as used herein sensing is reserved for the noting of an electrical signal or obtaining data information and detection is the processing analysis of these sensed signals and noting the presence of an arrhythmia. In some instances detection or detecting includes sensing and in some instances sensing of a particular signal alone is sufficient for detection e.g. presence absence etc. .

The timing intervals between sensed events e.g. P waves R waves and depolarization signals associated with fibrillation which are sometimes referred to as F waves or Fib waves are then classified by the arrhythmia detector of the microcontroller by comparing them to a predefined rate zone limit i.e. bradycardia normal low rate VT high rate VT and fibrillation rate zones and various other characteristics e.g. sudden onset stability physiologic sensors and morphology etc. in order to determine the type of remedial therapy that is needed e.g. bradycardia pacing anti tachycardia pacing cardioversion shocks or defibrillation shocks collectively referred to as tiered therapy .

Cardiac signals are also applied to inputs of an analog to digital A D data acquisition system . The data acquisition system is configured to acquire intracardiac electrogram EGM signals convert the raw analog data into a digital signal and store the digital signals for later processing and or telemetric transmission to an external device . Data acquisition system may be configured by microcontroller via control signals . The data acquisition system is coupled to the right atrial lead the coronary sinus lead the right ventricular lead and or the nerve stimulation lead through the switch to sample cardiac signals across any pair of desired electrodes.

The microcontroller is further coupled to a memory by a suitable data address bus wherein the programmable operating parameters used by the microcontroller are stored and modified as required in order to customize the operation of the stimulation device to suit the needs of a particular patient. Such operating parameters define for example pacing pulse amplitude pulse duration electrode polarity rate sensitivity automatic features arrhythmia detection criteria and the amplitude waveshape number of pulses and vector of each shocking pulse to be delivered to the patient s heart within each respective tier of therapy. One feature may be the ability to sense and store a relatively large amount of data e.g. from the data acquisition system which data may then be used for subsequent analysis to guide the programming of the device.

Essentially the operation of the ICTD control circuitry including but not limited to pulse generators timing control circuitry delay modules the activity module battery utilization and related voltage and current control and sensing and detection circuits may be controlled partly controlled or fine tuned by a variety of parameters such as those indicated above which may be stored and modified and may be set via an external ICTD programming device.

Advantageously the operating parameters of the implantable device may be non invasively programmed into the memory through a telemetry circuit in telemetric communication via communication link with the external device such as a general purpose computer a dedicated ICTD programmer a transtelephonic transceiver or a diagnostic system analyzer. The microcontroller activates the telemetry circuit with a control signal . The telemetry circuit advantageously allows intracardiac electrograms and status information relating to the operation of the device as contained in the microcontroller or memory to be sent to the external device through an established communication link . The ICTD may also receive human programmer instructions via the external device .

The stimulation device can further include a physiologic sensor commonly referred to as a rate responsive sensor because it is typically used to adjust pacing stimulation rate according to the exercise state of the patient. However the physiological sensor may further be used to detect changes in cardiac output see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 314 323 entitled Heart stimulator determining cardiac output by measuring the systolic pressure for controlling the stimulation to Ekwall issued Nov. 6 2001 which discusses a pressure sensor adapted to sense pressure in a right ventricle and to generate an electrical pressure signal corresponding to the sensed pressure an integrator supplied with the pressure signal which integrates the pressure signal between a start time and a stop time to produce an integration result that corresponds to cardiac output changes in the physiological condition of the heart or diurnal changes in activity e.g. detecting sleep and wake states . Accordingly the microcontroller may respond by adjusting the various pacing parameters such as rate AA delay AV delay W delay etc. at which the atrial and ventricular pulse generators and generate stimulation pulses.

While shown as being included within the stimulation device it is to be understood that the physiologic sensor may also be external to the stimulation device yet still be implanted within or carried by the patient. Examples of physiologic sensors that may be implemented in device include known sensors that for example sense respiration rate pH of blood ventricular gradient cardiac output preload afterload contractility hemodynamics pressure and so forth. Another sensor that may be used is one that detects activity variance wherein an activity sensor is monitored diurnally to detect the low variance in the measurement corresponding to the sleep state. For a complete description of an example activity variance sensor the reader is directed to U.S. Pat. No. 5 476 483 Bornzin et al. issued Dec. 19 1995 which patent is hereby incorporated by reference.

More specifically the physiological sensors optionally include sensors for detecting movement and minute ventilation in the patient. The physiological sensors may include a position sensor and or a minute ventilation MV sensor to sense minute ventilation which is defined as the total volume of air that moves in and out of a patient s lungs in a minute. Signals generated by the position sensor and MV sensor are passed to the microcontroller for analysis in determining whether to adjust the pacing rate etc. The microcontroller monitors the signals for indications of the patient s position and activity status such as whether the patient is climbing upstairs or descending downstairs or whether the patient is sitting up after lying down.

The stimulation device additionally includes a battery that provides operating power to all of the circuits shown in as well as to any additional circuits which may be present in alternative embodiments. Operating power in the form of electrical current and or voltage may be provided via a power bus or power buses depicted in as a first power bus . and a second power bus .. In the connection s of power bus es to other elements of ICTD for purposes of powering those elements is not illustrated but is implied by the dotted end lines of bus es .

For the stimulation device which employs shocking therapy the battery is capable of operating at low current drains for long periods of time e.g. preferably less than 10 A and is capable of providing high current pulses for capacitor charging when the patient requires a shock pulse e.g. preferably in excess of 2 Amps at voltages above 2 volts for periods of 10 seconds or more . In an embodiment battery may be configured to provide a current as high as 3.5 to 4.5 Amps and or unloaded voltages in excess of 4 volts for rapid charging of shocking circuitry. Battery also desirably has a predictable discharge characteristic so that elective replacement time can be determined.

In an embodiment battery may be a hybrid battery comprised of dual types of cells. Such a hybrid battery may provide power via a plurality of power buses such as buses . and . of . In an embodiment each power bus may be configured to deliver different voltages different currents and or different power levels. Battery may be monitored and or controlled via battery control as discussed in part above and as also discussed further below.

The stimulation device can further include magnet detection circuitry not shown coupled to the microcontroller to detect when a magnet is placed over the stimulation device . A magnet may be used by a clinician to perform various test functions of the stimulation device and or to signal the microcontroller that the external programmer is in place to receive or transmit data to the microcontroller through the telemetry circuit .

The stimulation device further includes an impedance measuring circuit that is enabled by the microcontroller via a control signal . The known uses for an impedance measuring circuit include but are not limited to lead impedance surveillance during the acute and chronic phases for proper lead positioning or dislodgement detecting operable electrodes and automatically switching to an operable pair if dislodgement occurs measuring respiration or minute ventilation measuring thoracic impedance for determining shock thresholds detecting when the device has been implanted measuring stroke volume and detecting the opening of heart valves etc. The impedance measuring circuit is advantageously coupled to the switch so that any desired electrode may be used.

In the case where the stimulation device is intended to operate as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICTD device it detects the occurrence of an arrhythmia and automatically applies an appropriate therapy to the heart aimed at terminating the detected arrhythmia. To this end the microcontroller further controls a shocking circuit by way of a control signal . The shocking circuit generates shocking pulses of low e.g. up to approximately 0.5 J moderate e.g. approximately 0.5 J to approximately 10 J or high energy e.g. approximately 11 J to approximately 40 J as controlled by the microcontroller . Such shocking pulses are applied to the patient s heart through at least two shocking electrodes and as shown in this embodiment selected from the left atrial coil electrode the RV coil electrode and or the SVC coil electrode . As noted above the housing may act as an active electrode in combination with the RV coil electrode or as part of a split electrical vector using the SVC coil electrode or the left atrial coil electrode i.e. using the RV electrode as a common electrode . Other exemplary devices may include one or more other coil electrodes or suitable shock electrodes e.g. a LV coil etc. .

Shocking circuit either has within it or is coupled to one or more shocking capacitors not shown in . The shocking capacitor s may be used to store up energy and then release that energy during the generation of shocking pulses.

Cardioversion level shocks are generally considered to be of low to moderate energy level where possible so as to minimize pain felt by the patient and or synchronized with an R wave and or pertaining to the treatment of tachycardia. Defibrillation shocks are generally of moderate to high energy level i.e. corresponding to thresholds in the range of approximately 5 J to approximately 40 J delivered asynchronously since R waves may be too disorganized and pertaining exclusively to the treatment of fibrillation. Accordingly microcontroller is capable of controlling the synchronous or asynchronous delivery of the shocking pulses.

As indicated above the operating parameters of the implantable device may be non invasively programmed into the memory through a telemetry circuit in telemetric communication via communication link with the external device . The external device may be a general purpose computer running custom software for programming the ICTD a dedicated external programmer device of ICTD a transtelephonic transceiver or a diagnostic system analyzer. Generically all such devices may be understood as embodying computers computational devices or computational systems with supporting hardware or software which enable interaction with data reception from and programming of ICTD .

An implantable lead refers to an elongated flexible tubular element commonly though not necessarily with a circular cross section orthogonal to the axis of elongation. A lead is composed of one or more cables and a sheath which houses the cables as defined further below. A lead has a proximal end and a distal end. The proximal end of the lead is designed to attach to a pulse generator e.g. an ICTD or other therapeutic or sensing device . Depending upon the specific medical therapy the distal end of the lead may be designed to have one or more elements for attaching the lead to organic tissue e.g. fixing tines and or electrode elements for delivery of electricity to organic tissue typically for therapeutic purposes and or other elements for delivery of other therapeutic treatments to organic tissue and or elements for sensing an activity of organic tissue.

In some cases the attaching element s may be the same as the electrode s other therapeutic delivery element s or sensing element s . In some cases elements for attaching to organic tissue for delivery of electricity for delivery of other therapeutic treatments or for sensing may also be placed at one or more points intermediate between the proximal end and the distal end. Suitable alterations such as placement of punctures or holes made be made to the sheath defined below and to other jacketing coating or insulation defined below to enable suitable mechanical and or electrical connectivity between these intermediate elements and the interior electrically conducting cables and or other interior therapeutic delivery pathways of the lead as will be discussed herein.

The body or sheath of an implantable lead is a typically non conducting element of a lead which provides the exterior insulation of the lead and may also provide interior separation and or insulation between two or more conducting cables as defined below if multiple cables are employed within the lead. The sheath typically extends the full length or almost the full length of the lead possibly excluding the length of the proximal and distal end elements for attaching to the pulse generator or ICTD electrodes etc. . As will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant arts the sheath of a lead may have multiple layers for example an inner insulating sheath and an outermost sheath. The sheath may be made from any number of materials which demonstrate resilience and flexibility including for example and without limitation silicone rubber polyurethane Optim a silicone polyurethane co polymer insulation PTFE polytetrafluoroethylene or ETFE ethylene tetrafluoroethylene polyimide paryline PFA etc.

In some lead designs the sheath provides one or more hollow mutually insulated interior canals or tubular spaces known as lumens running substantially parallel to the outer wall of the sheath which typically run the full length or substantially the full length of the sheath. The lumens are designed to provide a pathway for one or more electrically conducting cables and or coil conductors for delivery of therapeutic treatments or for sensing or pathways for delivery of other therapeutic treatments. One or more lumens may also be designed to accommodate a stylet or wire guide etc. When a sheath has two or more lumens running through it these may be referred to together as a multilumen. In this document the term lumen may sometimes be used in place of multilumen where the context makes clear the meaning or where either a lumen single canal or multilumen may be intended.

A cable is an electrically conducting element made from a conducting material including for example and without limitation silver copper nickel chromium aluminum iron molybdenum etc. and or various alloys of these metals and other metals typically running the full length or substantially the full length of an ICTD or other medical lead. The conducting elements of a cable central core cable layers and filaments defined further below are also composed of conducting elements including for example and without limitation silver copper nickel chromium aluminum iron molybdenum etc. and or various alloys of these metals and other metals . A cable may also have within it non conducting materials and or coatings as discussed further below.

For ICTD leads a cable is typically dedicated to and designed for carrying a single type of electrical signal or therapeutic electricity. For example a cable may be dedicated to right ventricular RV shocking or to superior vena cava SVC shocking or to sensing cardiac activity. In some cases a cable may be configured for dual purposes for example shocking and sensing but will typically still be configured to carry only a single electrical signal at a time for example either a shocking charge or a sensing signal . Functionally a cable is equivalent to what may be conventionally viewed as a single conductor or single wire carrying electricity. However a cable may actually be comprised of multiple filaments of electrically conductive material. At the proximal end the cable may include means for connection with the pulse generator e.g. a ICTD or other therapeutic device and at the distal end may be an electrode or other element for delivery of therapeutic treatment or for sensing purposes. Other elements may be attached between the proximal and distal ends connected to the cable via holes in the lumen.

Persons skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that the views of exemplary leads shown in represent cross sectional views only. Orthogonal to the cross sectional views shown are the lengths of the leads which are elongated flexible tubular elements wherein the lumens are configured to receive such elements as cables coils or stylets. Cables and coils are used for such purposes as conducting electrical signals or electrical impulses for cardiac sensing and cardiac shocking Although a specific lumen configuration is shown in any suitable lumen configuration may be employed. For example certain commercially available cardiac leads employ a five lumen sheath design with varying shapes for selected lumens. Also certain commercially available neurostimulation leads employ larger numbers of lumens with the sheaths. Any such sheath designs may be employed according to some embodiments.

Fabrication of implantable leads can be a challenging task. Attachment of electrodes to the lead body and coupling of the electrodes to the cables or conductors of the lead body typically involves complex delicate operations. Frequently holes windows or apertures are created in the insulative material of the sheath of the lead body. The electrodes are electrically coupled to the lead cables conductors through these items. A variety of techniques have been employed to create the holes through the sheath. When creating the holes in the sheath a significant amount of accuracy is important. Specifically the removal of insulative material to access a specific lumen should not also inadvertently create access through the same hole to another lumen. Also the removal of insulative material should not weaken the sheath beyond a point where subsequent lead processing will be unsuccessful. For example if a lumen is too close to the outer surface of the sheath at a given axial location along the sheath the creation of an aperture at that axial location may cause the sheath to subsequently fail during further processing or at a later time.

Known techniques to identify lumens include simple visual inspection by a system operator through a camera of a micromaching laser system. Such visual identification of the lumens by a system operator can be impractical for performance in a repeatable reliable manner if the optical characteristics of the insulative material of the sheath cause internal reflections between the lumens of the sheath. Another technique includes inserting wires of respective colors within the lumens to increase the visibility of the lumens for identification through a processing system camera. Also it is known to insert a fixture of multiple pins into the lumens at a distal and or proximal end to align a given sheath and to control rotation of the sheath during insulative removal operations. However these known techniques are not practical for all sheath designs. Smaller sheath sizes with flexible sheath materials may make the insertion of wires of respective colors into the lumens impractical and or unduly expensive. Further the degree of axial twist of a sheath may cause the use of a fixture for insertion into the lumens to be of limited or no benefit.

Some embodiments are directed to a system that automatically identifies the lumens of a sheath using optical imaging and processing techniques to be discussed below . Upon identification the system creates holes or apertures in the sheath preferably using laser ablation.

Referring again to laser system displacement meter and hardware are communicatively coupled to control computer e.g. through RS 232C or USB cables WiFi or BLUETOOTH wireless functionality etc. . Control computer may include conventional computer components such as a processor memory input output interfaces and ports a keyboard a display input peripheral s etc. not individually depicted in . Control computer also includes executable software stored within memory of computer . The software communicates with laser system and displacement meter to control the operations of system e.g. through one or more application programming interfaces APIs . For example the software may control displacement meter to scan sheath . The software may control laser system to apply laser pulses at specific positions along sheath to create the desired apertures in the outer surface of sheath to respective lumens within sheath . The software may include software distributed by the vendors of laser system and sheath .

The software may also include special purpose software to process the data from displacement meter to select positions for application of laser pulses on sheath . The special purpose software may also include interface software for presenting a generated profile of the sheath cross section. Software may also display the automatically selected locations along the sheath for application of laser pulses for review by the operator of system . Respective segments of software code are preferably implemented or provided to receive data from an appropriate source e.g. representing sheath data or system data process the data and communicating control signals to implement each respective functional task discussed herein.

In operation control computer initially causes displacement meter in conjunction with rotation hardware to scan across the circumference of sheath at one or more respective axial locations along sheath . The functionality of displacement meter is known and is briefly described herein. Displacement meter generates a laser beam and applies the beam to sheath through an objective lens. The lens is vibrated up and down at a relatively high speed e.g. by a tuning fork . The beam is reflected by the insulative material of sheath and is converged on a pinhole. The light re enters the light receiving element of meter . By measuring the exact position of the lens when the light enters the light receiving element the displacement distance is calculated. Using this data a detailed end view profile can be plotted and displayed.

In one embodiment the insulative material of sheath is Elast Eon polymer material a silicone polyurethane co polymer insulation developed by AorTech International Plc . This material and other similar implantable materials are transparent. Since the insulative material of sheath is transparent peak values of light are produced by respective layers within sheath e.g. where the insulative material of sheath transitions to the empty space defined by a lumen . However resolution of the internal characteristics of sheath is complicated by the internal reflections within sheath caused by the respective lumens. Some embodiments implemented within control computer and processing software apply suitable processing algorithms implemented within displacement meter data processing software to resolve the displacement data into a data representation of the cross sectional profile of sheath .

Using the generated cross sectional profile processing software also automatically identifies the respective lumens determines distances from the lumens to the surface of sheath and identifies a respective location on the surface of sheath for application of one or more laser pulses to create the desired window if appropriate . In some embodiments the locations are selected for all of the lumens of sheath . In other embodiments the locations are selected only for a lesser subset of lumens. For example in one embodiment locations are only selected for the three smaller lumens of sheath . In some embodiments the angular locations for application of a laser pulse may be selected at locations where the distance between a respective lumen and the outer surface of the sheath is smallest. The axial location are selected according to the electrode sensor configuration of the lead design.

Some representative embodiments are adapted to address variations in the sheath characteristics. For example the distance from the surface of sheath to each respective lumen may vary due to variations in the manufacturing process used for sheath . If the distance is too small it is possible that the creation of a window to access the respective lumen may cause failure of the sheath e.g. permit entry of bodily fluids within a given lumen after implantation within a patient . Some representative embodiments automatically calculate the distance from the outer surface of sheath to the lumen. If the distance is too small e.g as defined by a constraint in software control software on control computer will attempt to identify another axial location along sheath that is suitable for the respective electrode or sensor and where the distance is sufficient. Excess length may be provided to an initial segment of sheath beyond the length necessary for fabrication of a suitable lead to accommodate for this contingency.

In scan operations using a confocal displacement meter device are performed for one or more locations on the sheath. The location s may be selected relative to the current position and the intended electrode sensor configuration for the lead design. Axial translation and rotation of the sheath may be applied by the system between the respective scan operations.

In the data from the displacement meter for scan position s is processed. The processing may include generating a cross sectional profile of the sheath at the various scan locations. Also the processing may include identifying the outer diameter of the sheath identifying lumens including lumen diameter and lumen position and identifying the distance from the lumens to the outer surface of the sheath.

In a logical comparison is made to determine whether the lumen data indicates that the lumen characteristics are acceptable at the respective locations e.g. whether the lumens are within an acceptable distance from the outer surface of the sheath . If not the process flow proceeds to step .

If a predetermined number of attempts have not been made see logical comparison at the current position is advanced by a predetermined distance axially along the sheath and the process returns to step to repeat the scanning processing at the new location. If the predetermined number of attempts have already been made the process flow ends by rejecting the sheath before further processing occurs .

In locations about the sheath are automatically selected for application of laser pulses to create the intended apertures. The angular component of locations about the circumference of the sheath are selected using the calculated lumen positions. Also the axial locations along the length of the sheath are selected according to the intended electrode sensor positions for the lead design.

In the calculated results are presented to the operator of the system using an interface screen on a display of the system. The interface screen may include a cross sectional representation of the sheath. The calculated sheath diameter and lumen data may be displayed. The interface screen is preferably adapted to receive user input to control further operations. As shown in the flowchart in operator input is received. In a logical comparison is made based on the operator input. In one case rescan operations may be attempted e.g. at a new location . In another case one or more of the automatically selected locations are modified according to additional user input for subsequent laser operations. Also if the automatically selected locations are accepted by the operator the process flow may proceed immediately.

In laser operations are performed to create the desired apertures for access to the respective lumens of the sheath at the automatically selected locations or as modified by the operator . The laser operations may include rotation and or axial translation of the sheath to place each desired location within the field of the laser pulses. Beam control and motion control operations of the laser device may also be controlled to ensure that the laser pulses are applied to selected locations. After creation of the apertures the sheath is ready for further processing to create an implantable lead.

An implantable lead may be fabricated from the processed sheaths with the provided apertures or holes. Conventional or subsequently developed processes may be applied to fabricate the implantable leads from the processed sheaths. For example conductor wires cables or coils may be introduced through the respective lumens. A welding element a slug may be attached to the respective coils or cables. The welding elements on the coils or cables may be advanced through the respective lumens until the welding elements are adjacent to the apertures or holes. Electrodes and or sensors are provided. The electrodes and sensors are electrically coupled to the welding elements e.g. using laser weld operations possibly using intermediate conductive elements. Crimping swaging or any other suitable technique may be employed for securing the electrodes sensors about the sheath.
