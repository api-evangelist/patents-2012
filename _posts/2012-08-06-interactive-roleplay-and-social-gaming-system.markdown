This disclosure generally relates to the field of computer systems. More particularly the disclosure relates to social networking.

Some social networking systems allow players to interact with each other to play online games. For example users may remotely collaborate in playing an online game. An online game involves a set of rules according to which a player interacts with a computerized system and or another player. The player is typically challenged during the online game to perform a task. Player interactions that take place in a game context are different from many other types of interactions e.g. commercial transactions email communications emergency notifications and the like in that games may tolerate uncertain or unreliable message delivery delayed message delivery and the like. It is believed that improvements in conventional messaging systems are needed to better support the gaming environment.

Separately some live action role playing LARP experiences allow players to role play in a role play game in the physical world. As an example an amusement park may provide a role play experience that includes performers interacting with guests throughout different locations in the amusement park. Guests may want to interact with others such as their friends who are not present in the physical role play game so that those friends may also enjoy the role pay game experience. Conventional messaging systems are designed primarily for reliable asynchronous communication and as such are not adapted for casual substantially synchronous interaction that would be desirable in a role play game. For example friends of the role play game participants may not be available to provide input at the time that the role play game participants are playing the role play game in the physical world. Accordingly the role play game participant may send a message that may not be read until the role play game participant has progressed through later parts of the role play game or possibly even finished the role play game. It is believed that improvements in conventional messaging systems are needed to better support LARP experiences.

In one aspect of the disclosure a computer program product is described. The computer program product includes a computer readable medium having a computer readable program stored thereon. The computer readable program while executing on a computer causes the computer to receive at a role play module that monitors a social networking platform an indication of a game event from a first player located in a physical environment where a role play game is conducted. The first player has a first role in the role play game. Further the computer readable program while executing on the computer causes the computer to provide the indication from the role play module to the social networking platform. The social networking platform provides the indication to a second player remotely situated from the physical environment. The second player has a second role in the role play game. In addition the computer readable program while executing on the computer causes the computer to asynchronously receive from the second player at the role play module an instruction for an action to be performed by the first player in the role play game. The computer readable program while executing on the computer also causes the computer to provide the instruction to the first player.

In another aspect of the disclosure a process is described. The process receives at a role play module that monitors a social networking platform an indication of a game event from a first player located in a physical environment where a role play game is conducted. The first player has a first role in the role play game. Further the process provides the indication from the role play module to the social networking platform. The social networking platform provides the indication to a second player remotely situated from the physical environment. The second player has a second role in the role play game. In addition the process asynchronously receives from the second player at the role play module an instruction for an action to be performed by the first player in the role play game. The process also provides the instruction to the social networking platform provides the instruction to the first player.

In yet another aspect of the disclosure a system is described. The system comprises a processor configured to receive at a role play module that monitors a social networking platform an indication of a game event from a first player located in a physical environment where a role play game is conducted. The role play module provides the indication to the social networking platform and the social networking platform provides the indication to a second player remotely situated from the physical environment. The system is further configured to asynchronously receive from the second player an instruction for an action to be performed by the first player in the role play game and provide the instruction to the first player.

In another aspect of the disclosure a computer program product is described. The computer program product includes a computer readable medium having a computer readable program stored thereon. The computer readable program while executing on a computer causes the computer to receive at a role play module that monitors a social networking platform an indication of a game event from a first player located in a physical environment where a role play game is conducted. The first player has a first role in the role play game. Further the computer readable program while executing on the computer causes the computer to provide the indication from the role play module to the social networking platform and the social networking platform provides the indication to a second player remotely situated from the physical environment. The second player has a second role in the role play game. In addition the computer readable program while executing on the computer causes the computer to asynchronously receive from the second player a set of data associated with the role play game. The computer readable program when executed on the computer also causes the computer to generate at the role play module an instruction based upon the set of data. Further the computer readable program while executing on the computer causes the computer to provide the instruction to the social networking platform such that the social networking platform provides the instruction to the first player.

A system may be utilized to provide both an interactive role play experience in a physical environment and an interactive experience in a remote location. The system allows participants in a role play game in a physical environment to asynchronously collaborate with their personal social network of friends family and or the like who are in physical locations remote from the physical environment. As an example a role play game participant in an amusement park may interact with a role play game participant in a remote location through a social network platform. In one aspect a module may be connected to a social network platform that allows both the role play game participant in the physical environment of the role play game and the role play game participant that is located remotely from the physical environment of the role play game to interact.

Alternatively the role play functionality may be implemented in an integrated software system rather than a modular set of software code. In other words the role play functionality may be implemented throughout a variety of different system components.

Platforms other than the social networking platform may be utilized with the system . A platform such as a social network a voice based communication system an SMS system or other communication system that allows users to interact with each other may be utilized with the system .

The social networking platform interacts with the role play module . The participant utilizes his or her computing device to interact with the social networking platform . Further the participant may utilize his or computing device to interact with the role play module through the social networking platform . The participant may also interact directly with the social networking platform . The role play module may interact with the social networking platform to monitor the interactions that the participant and the participant have with the social networking platform . Based upon such monitoring the role play module may then generate role play game communications and or instructions between the participant and the participant for the role play game.

As an example the participant may post a message to the social networking platform through the role play module that he or she has arrived at a particular location in an amusement park. The role play module may forward that message to the participant so that the participant is aware of the location of the participant . Further the role play module may generate a role play game task for the participant based upon the location of the participant in the amusement park. For example the role play module may instruct the participant to solve a puzzle that will help determine a clue for a task that the participant has to complete in the amusement park as part of the role play game. The participant may then communicate with the participant through the social networking platform by providing a message to the role play module that may be forwarded to the participant through the social networking platform .

In one aspect the role play module interacts with the social networking platform through an API of the social networking platform . In other words the role play module utilizes a communication protocol that is understandable by the social networking platform to interact with the social networking platform .

The role play module allows the participant and the participant to access data and functionality pertaining to the role play game through the social networking platform . In other words the participants may play certain features of the role play game through the role play module . For example each participant may access a web page through his or her social networking account that provides role play features of the role play game. For instance the role play module may instruct the participant to perform a task in the physical environment and the participant to perform a task that may be performed remotely from the physical environment . For instance the participant may be instructed to move to a particular location within the physical environment whereas the participant may be instructed to perform an online puzzle to find a clue that may assists the participant in the physical environment .

In yet another aspect the role play module may access the user profiles of the participants. A user profile may be created and stored by the social networking platform and contains information such as interests previous games played player game statistics or the like. The role play module may utilize the user profiles to customize the role play gaming experience for both the participants in the physical environment and the participants in the remote location . For example the user profile of the participant may indicate that the participant enjoys walking. Accordingly the role play module may customize the role play gaming experience of the participant to include tasks that involve walking to various locations. As another example the user profile of the participant may indicate that the participant enjoys puzzles. Accordingly the role play module may customize the role play gaming experience of the participant to include puzzles.

The participant provides an instruction to the participant for an action to be performed by the participant . The participant may instruct the participant to move to a different location in the physical environment based upon a clue found by the participant by solving a puzzle. The instruction is asynchronously received by the participant from the participant . The term asynchronous is herein defined to mean that there may be a time lag between interactions. The participant does not have to perform the instructions received from the participant in order for game play to proceed. In other words the participant is not prevented from continuing the role play game based upon whether or not the instruction was provided by remote participant . The participant may have received instruction from multiple other remote participants and may choose which to follow. In yet another aspect the participant does have to perform the instructions received from the participant before being allowed to transition game states. In other words performance of the instruction received by the participant from the participant is a condition to transitioning game states in the role play game.

In another aspect the role play module dynamically adjusts play of the role play game based upon the interaction with the participants. For example if the participant is performing tasks in the physical environment too quickly the role play module may adjust the tasks in the physical environment to make the tasks more complex. As another example if the participant is solving online puzzles too quickly the role play module may adjust the online puzzles to make the online puzzles more complex. Further the role play module may adjust the tasks of either or both participants based upon the interaction between the participants. If the participant is not completing tasks provided by the participant quickly the role play module may increase the complexity of the tasks performed by the participant to decrease the rate at which the participant is sending instructions to the participant .

In another implementation the role play module may be an application that is downloaded by each participant to his or her computing device . The role play module in such instance may be configured to function with the social networking platform .

At role play module receives from a first player located in a physical environment where a role play game is conducted an indication of a game event. Further at role play module provides the indication through a social network to a second player remotely situated from the physical environment. In addition at role play module asynchronously receives from the second player through the social network an instruction for an action to be performed by the first player in the role play game. At role play module provides the instruction to the first player.

The participant in the physical environment may manually select a friend on the social networking platform to request to play in the role play game. Alternatively a contextual availability ranking system may be utilized to automatically or semi automatically perform or aid in the selection of select a friend of the participant in the physical environment on the social networking platform to assign a task in the role play game. For example the participant in the physical environment may want to get immediate assistance from a friend. The participant in the physical environment may avoid having to manually attempt to request participation from friends that may be unavailable.

The contextual availability ranking flow chart dynamically determines the type of experience or communication that a friend receives. For example if a friend is at home the friend may get a longer message and a more complex game that may be accessed from a home computer whereas a friend who is shopping may receive a simpler and quicker interaction message via a messaging service such as short message service SMS .

The contextual availability ranking configuration may perform an analysis regarding the contextual availability of different friends of the participant on the social networking platform illustrated in . As an example at decision block it is determined whether a particular friend is active in a game such as the role play game. If the friend is active an active rating is generated for the friend at based on how active the friend is in the role play game. For example a high rating may be provided if the friend plays the role play game hourly whereas a low rating may be provided if the friend plays the role play game monthly. If the friend is not active block skips the particular friend. Other friends may then be analyzed.

Decision block determines where the friend is located. If the friend is shopping decision block determines whether the friend is on a mobile device. If the friend is on a mobile device an SMS or e mail is sent to that particular friend at . If the friend is not on a mobile device the contextual availability ranking configuration proceeds to the block to skip the particular friend. Other friends may then be analyzed.

Decision determines if the friend is active on a social networking platform if the friend is located at work or home. An SMS or e mail is sent at with a link to a website game if the friend is logged into the website. As a result the friend is alerted to a game request that may be time sensitive. Otherwise the friend may not become aware of the game request in time to participate in the game. Alternatively based on the result of decision an SMS or e mail is sent at in addition to finding a back up friend if the friend is inactive. As another alternative based on the decision in an SMS or e mail may be sent in addition to a simple game at if the friend is logged in through a mobile device. As yet another alternative from the decision in an in application message may be sent at in addition to a complex game if the friend is utilizing a desktop application.

The example provided in is provided merely for illustrative purposes. The contextual availability ranking configuration may be utilized with different decision blocks different action blocks and or the like to meet the needs of a particular application. In other words different decisions and or actions may be utilized so long as the functions and behaviors described herein are implemented in a manner substantially equivalent to the description herein.

The contextual availability ranking configuration may be utilized to select a friend of a participant in the physical environment to also have a role in the role play gaming experience or to assign a task in the role play gaming experience. The friend may interact remotely. The selection of that friend is based on a ranking that is generated according to analyzing each friend from a group of friends on the social networking platform illustrated in with the contextual availability ranking configuration . The various data gathered also helps determine the level of interaction that the friend may have in the role play game experience. The friend may be in a location and have a device where he or she may perform more complex actions than if he or she was in a different location with a different device.

In one alternative the contextual availability ranking configuration selects which friend to communicated with based on a ranking of the availability of friends from a group of friends. In another aspect the contextual availability ranking configuration determines the most optimal method of communication based on contextual factors. In yet another aspect the contextual availability ranking configuration determines the content of the communication based on contextual factors.

In another alternative game play of the role play game may be dynamically rerouted based upon an automatic determination of external factors. illustrates a rerouting system . The rerouting system includes an input . The input may be gathered from a variety of sources including various devices instruments and or systems such as a thermometer hygrometer sound level meter monitoring system or the like. Alternatively or in addition input includes actual estimated and or forecast data such as park attendance guest flow environmental temperature precipitation events status audio levels or the like. The dynamic gameplay system may then utilize the input to automatically determine whether or not gameplay should be rerouted. Accordingly the gameplay system may output the decision as an output . The output may be a signal or a message that indicates a yes or no decision with respect to rerouting. The output may also include a new location to which the role play game should be rerouted. The output may be provided to one or more display systems that provide the rerouting information to role play game personnel to direct movement of the role play game participants. Alternatively the output may be provided to one or more display systems that provide the rerouting information directly to the role play game participants.

In one embodiment the rerouting system may be a subsystem of the role play module . In another embodiment the rerouting system may be implemented independently of the role play module .

Subsequently or in parallel rerouting decisions based attendance occur at . If attendance is greater than a pre established high water mark an action is performed at to slow down the pace of the game. For example additional game challenges may be provided at various locations so that game participants have to stop more often. When attendance is in a normal range for which the game was designed rerouting is not necessary and game play will continue without rerouting at . When attendance is less than a pre established low water mark the pace of game play may speed up at by for example removing game challenges at various locations so that game participants have to stop less often.
