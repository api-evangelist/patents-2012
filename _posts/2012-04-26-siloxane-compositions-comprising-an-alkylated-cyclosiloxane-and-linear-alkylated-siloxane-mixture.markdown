This application is a continuation in part of co pending application Ser. No. 13 009 281 filed on Jan. 19 2011 which in turn is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 12 639 476 filed Dec. 16 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 897 558 issued Mar. 1 2011.

This invention relates to the development of non aqueous low VOC HAP free cleaner to meet new environmental regulation California Rule 1171 . VOCs are released during cleaning operations contributing to the formation of ground level ozone photochemical smog which can damage lung tissue cause respiratory illness and damage vegetation. Solvent emissions are regulated regionally and locally with the air pollution control districts in California implementing the most stringent requirements. The South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD has imposed restrictions limiting the VOC content in solvents to no greater than 25 grams per liter for immersion cleaning processes unless the solvent is used in an airtight cleaning system. In addition under Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act CAA amendments the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA established emissions standards for categories and subcategories of sources that emit or have the potential to emit listed HAPs. More specifically this invention relates to cyclicsiloxane compositions and to methods of using said siloxane compositions which comprise a unique combination of two or more alkylated cyclic and linear siloxanes alkylene glycols and glycolethers characterized as low volatile siloxane compositions with flash points above 140 F. and vapor pressures of less than seven millimeters of mercury 7 mm Hg .

Solvent cleaners are known for their cleaning ability quick drying metal compatibility and low surface tension to facilitate penetration. Unfortunately most of these solvents are known also for the air pollution they cause regarding as volatile organic compounds or VOC toxicity flammability and incompatibility with plastics. Moreover the use of volatile organic compounds VOC solvents has been discouraged due to their deleterious effect on the environment. Regulations have been promulgated to accelerate the phase out of environmentally destructive solvents. The Environmental Protection Agency EPA promulgates rules and regulations regarding environmental concerns such as VOCs. EPA has defined a VOC to include any volatile compound of carbon which participates in atmospheric photochemical reactivity. Thus there is a need to reduce the use of conventional VOC solvents. It is apparent that a need exists for a solvent system which has little or no VOC content. The old specification P D 680 solvent commonly called Stoddard solvent or mineral spirits contains petroleum fractions that are complex mixtures of mostly aliphatic hydrocarbons but may contain some aromatics and olefinics. As such P D 680 contains hazardous air pollutants HAPs and VOCs and causes health and environmental concerns. The revision to MIL PRF 680 eliminated the HAPs but MIL PRF 680 still covers a petroleum based solvent containing the same amount of VOCs as P D 680. These solvents have been specified for general cleaning to remove oil and grease from aircraft and engine components and from ground support equipment.

There are several alternatives to the MIL PRF 680 solvents water based semi aqueous and solvent based cleaners. Water based cleaners contain detergents to remove grease and oil and may be used hot and or with various forms of agitation spray or ultrasonic . Disadvantages include flash rusting embrittlement of high strength steel and poor cleaning efficiency. Semi aqueous cleaning processes incorporate not only detergents but also solvents to improve effectiveness. Some products contain solvents emulsified in water while other contain water rinsable solvents. A significant disadvantage to semi aqueous cleaners is their susceptibility to separation. Solvent based cleaners however continue to be used in effective low cost cleaning processes. In order to retain the capability of solvent cleaning a new type of solvent is needed to meet the HAP and VOC requirements.

Under the proposed rule MIL PRF 680 will no longer be allowed in solvent degreasing operations in the SCAQMD. If a substitute material or process is not authorized the Aircraft intermediate Maintenance Detachment AIMD at Lemoore and other maintenance facilities will not be able to perform specific maintenance requirements in accordance with NAVAIR technical manuals. Since MIL PRF 680 is the only material authorized by the applicable maintenance manuals to clean flight critical parts an approved alternative for MIL PRF 680 was necessary to meet the new environmental regulations.

Specifically solvent cleaning of aircraft components is performed at organizational intermediate and depot levels and usually takes place in either spray sinks or batch loaded dip tanks. The primary solvent used for these applications has been P D 680 Type II which has a VOC content of more than 750 grams per liter g L . P D 680 A A 59601 is a petroleum based solvent which contains hazardous air pollutants HAPs and volatile organic compounds VOCs which causes health and environmental problems. Its successor MIL PRF 680 is also a petroleum based solvent which contains the same amount of VOC as P D 680 but does not contain HAPs. Alternative processes to eliminate VOC emission are immersion cleaning with cold or hot water based products heated high pressure spray washing using water based products and exempt solvent cleaning. Water based processes are often ineffective on heavy soils and can result in flash rusting of steel components.

To meet the new environmental regulations NAVAIR Patuxent River developed a specification MIL PRF 32295A Cleaner Non Aqueous Low VOC HAP Free . The new specification consists of three types Type I is intended for cleaning light soils such as oils and hydraulic fluids Type II is intended for cleaning heavy soils such as greases and carbon residue and Type III is intended fbr wipe cleaning applications. Three products have met the qualification requirements of MIL PRF 32295A Type I specification. Currently Type I qualified products are listed in NAVAIR 01 IA 509 Manual Cleaning and Corrosion Control Manual for cleaning aircraft applications. The cyclicsiloxane compositions of this invention qualify to be used to clean weapon systems across DoD maintenance facilities as an alternative to MIL PRF 680.

The present invention relates to cyclic or cyclosiloxane compositions characterized as low volatile organic solvents. The low volatile organic solvents consist essentially of a unique combination of at least one or more substituted or alkylated cyclosiloxanes having 5 or 6 silicon atoms and at least one substituted or alkylated cyclosiloxane having 3 or 4 silicon atoms. In addition to the cyclosiloxanes the composition has at least one substituted or alkylated linear siloxane having 3 to 8 silicon atoms at least one alkylene alkylether and an alkylene glycol that must have at least 6 alkylene carbon atoms.
