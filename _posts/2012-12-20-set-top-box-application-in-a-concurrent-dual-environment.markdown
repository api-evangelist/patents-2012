1. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 715 785 entitled INTEGRATION OF UNTRUSTED FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS WITH A SECURE OPERATING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT filed Oct. 18 2012 

U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 725 964 entitled INTEGRATION OF UNTRUSTED APPLICATIONS AND FRAMEWORKS WITH A SECURE OPERATING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT filed Nov. 13 2012 and

U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 725 790 entitled SET TOP BOX APPLICATION IN A CONCURRENT DUAL ENVIRONMENT filed Nov. 13 2012 all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to processing systems and more particularly to the use of virtualization techniques when incorporating untrusted elements in a trusted or secure operating system environment such as a set top box.

Attempts to accommodate relatively untrusted software applications or frameworks in certain types of devices may complicate applicable certification processes that are performed in accordance with one or more industry defined certification standards or testing procedures. For example vendor certification of many set top boxes used by cable operators is conducted via rigid certification processes that test interoperability and security compliance for devices that implement specifications such as DOCSIS PacketCable CableHome and OpenCable . Successful certification of such devices typically requires full end to end security. Likewise digital rights management DRM and other technologies implemented in a particular device or component such as a system on a chip may require distinct certification processes which do not allow certain interactions with an unsecured operating system OS environment or software framework.

In general any unsecured portions of a media pathway in a set top box or like device if not isolated will cause the certification of such pathway to fail. Most conventional set top boxes are designed to provide a single secure and certified pathway through the various elements of the device. In some recent multi processor set top boxes a conventional certified pathway is separated from untrusted components by creating a hardware boundary between the two. In particular a first processing module is utilized to provide secure functionality e.g. decoding operations while a separate processing module with a lower security level is used to support an untrusted framework.

As is known a software framework may provide application programming interface functionality and services that are not offered by an underlying operating system and may thereby offer a level of platform independence in certain implementations. Frameworks are often designed to be a reusable and adaptable software system or subsystem. For example ANDROID Android has become one of the fastest growing operating systems frameworks for mobile devices. Android which builds on contributions from the open source Linux community provides development tools and reusable components for building applications that can be deployed across many different types of devices such as a smartphone or tablet device.

A typical Android framework is a multi user Linux based system in which each Android application is a different user having code that runs in general isolation from other applications. Such process isolation or application sandbox provides a certain level of security. However various components processes threads etc. used by an application may not entail sufficient protection when integrated in a set top box type device resulting in Android being considered an untrusted framework when used in such devices. For example an application that visits an arbitrary web page or receives code from an unverified third party may result in untrusted JavaScript code being executed on a set top box possibly with elevated privileges. Such code might exploit weakness in other code e.g. browser code and receive unauthorized access to file systems etc. thereby compromising the security of a device exposing protected data or introducing system instability.

As indicated above the processing unit of some devices may have multiple processors or processing cores in order to provide higher performance and or multi tasking capabilities. In some of these multi processor systems when multiple applications or programs are running access control is typically needed to separate the functionality of the applications running on multiple processors. Separation or segregation of different applications and or tasks running on different processors helps to ensure that one application does not interfere with the execution of another. Likewise data assigned to one processor should not be accessed by another processor unless that data is shared between the two processors. Such separation is typically handled through use of virtual memory with each process having a unique view of memory that is not accessible from outside processes. Hardware access can be handled through a kernel or device driver interface which provides some level of security. Even in a multi processor system in which one processor environment provides trusted or secure operations while another operates in an unsecure or restricted environment however there can be a substantial possibility of an incursion from the unsecure zone into the secure zone when the operating system is managing the separation.

For example in a set top box that allows a user to receive television signals and also allows the user to access the Internet the secure environment may run applications including a secure set top box application pertaining to the reception decryption and display of certain channels or content provided by a cable or satellite provider or other service operator. The unsecure environment in the set top box may execute applications such as Android based applications that allow a user to access the Internet for web browsing gaming etc. In this example the content provider would generally not want the user or anyone else to access the applications pertaining to broadcast or premium channels. However if there is commonality in software that controls the accesses to both environments such as running the same operating system to manage accesses in both environments then there may be a heightened risk of access violations. Such violations whether intentional or non intentional could result in an unsecure breach into the secure applications of the set top box such as a web originated intrusion into protected television channels.

Accordingly there is a need to obtain an efficient way to integrate untrusted frameworks framework components and applications with a secure set top box application.

While certain embodiments are described in conjunction with an Android framework and or Linux operating system other embodiments of the present invention may be practiced with a variety of current or future operating systems kernels and frameworks and employ a variety of computing circuits devices servers and or systems that might utilize multiple processors processing cores and or processing circuits. Further certain of the illustrations herein describe a processing module a processor or a CPU e.g. CPU1 CPU2 for a device that provides a processing function in the described embodiments. However it is appreciated that a variety of other devices and or nomenclature may be used in other embodiments to provide for the processing function in practicing the invention. The invention may be readily adapted to other usages where multiple processing environments zones domains etc. exist in which separation and or segregation between two or more zones is desired. Likewise while certain embodiments are described as implemented by a set top box STB or like media processing device performing trusted media processing operations the novel architectures and methodologies are applicable in whole or in part to other devices including media consumption devices such as PVR s DVD players access points televisions computing devices smartphones etc.

As described more fully below a secure software abstraction layer is provided to isolate access to underlying software hardware and secure components of the device. Communications and data exchanges between the untrusted framework and secure OS kernel may occur via a secure access layer or interface comprised of a secure access client and a secure access server that support an application programming interface API and secure inter process communication IPC calls or kernel drivers. In certain embodiments the secure access client may be part of or accessible by the framework while the secure access server is incorporated in a secure operating system environment or executed as a secure kernel module. In one embodiment the secure access interface may help prevent system breaches or destabilization resulting from bad data or parameters by performing without limitation parameter validation checking and peripheral range checking through hardware when applicable handle and pointer validation heap isolation and release of hardware resources following termination of a restricted process.

In addition to an access client the Android framework of the illustrated embodiment may include applications and application support JavaScript interpretation browser functions plug ins e.g. an Adobe Flash plug in and a Dalvik virtual machine. The Android framework further includes platform or operating system access functionality that enables limited access to necessary components of the secure Linux kernel environment through a minimal guest Linux services access interface .

As noted Android provides a component based framework for developing mobile applications. Each application may be comprised of differing numbers and types of components. By way of example such components can include Activity components that form the basis of a user interface where each screen presented to the user is a different Activity. Background processing is performed by Service components which also define arbitrary interfaces for communicating with other applications. Content Provider components function to share information in a relational database form while Broadcast Receiver components operate as an asynchronous mailbox for messages from the system and or other components. The Android framework of the disclosed embodiment supports varying degrees of collaboration and dependencies between applications.

However the interfaces used by applications to provide services and communicate with other applications or an underlying operating system must be secured to defend against breaches and general malfeasance. By default applications in a typical Android framework do not have permission to perform operations that might negatively impact other system components such as reading or writing private data or another application s files performing network access etc. . Because Android essentially sandboxes applications from each other applications must explicitly share resources and data by declaring permissions needed for additional capabilities that are outside of the basic sandbox. For example an application may statically declare the permissions it requires and at the time of installation the Android framework may prompt a user for appropriate consents. As noted above in the Description of the Related Art and without rigid hardware isolation and separate execution environments the potential for execution of unauthorized code from an untrusted framework may compromise overall system security and negatively impact certification procedures for certain devices absent methodologies and architectures e.g. a secure access server such as those described herein.

In the illustrated embodiment the untrusted Android framework is executed in a first virtual machine VM guest Linux container s such as an LXC or Linux resource container to provide further isolation from secure processes and resources. In this embodiment the STB application may similarly operate in a second VM host Linux container having full host Linux services access . Briefly and in general container based virtualization or operating system level virtualization allows a kernel to run with a plurality of isolated virtual machines or virtual environments installed on top of it. Each virtual environment may be dedicated to run a particular application and is typically not a complete operating system instance but rather a partial instance of the operating system that works with a virtualization layer or hardware resource abstraction layer in the host operating system kernel.

Although virtualization may mitigate the need for hardware separation of untrusted components in certain embodiments multiple processors having different levels of security may benefit from virtual container constructs which operate wholly via one of such processors while other containers may span multiple processors see for example the embodiment illustrated in . In one such embodiment a first processor s may be dedicated to execution of non secure functionality while a second secure processor s may be dedicated to conventional STB functionality. In various alternate embodiments an untrusted framework may be hardware sandboxed via for example non processor hardware peripherals memory isolation from processors and or peripherals etc. Various other divisions between secure and untrusted software and hardware are contemplated e.g. dividing an untrusted framework or applications themselves into a trusted portion and an untrusted portion examples of which are described below. Further by utilizing hardware and operating system virtualization features multiple operating systems may run simultaneously on the same hardware.

In some embodiments certain resources of a set top box platform such as media processing and hardware acceleration resources for audio video encoding and decoding rendering of 2D and 3D graphics using a standardized API such as Open Graphics Library or OpenGL DRM encryption decryption etc. and networking interfaces may be accessed by untrusted client applications frameworks through IPC calls communicated through network sockets. Likewise events such as IR control signals may be communicated from a set top box platform to untrusted client applications frameworks through IPC calls such as a call into an Android API or button .

In the illustrated embodiment a framework aggregator may be employed to embrace and extend operation with a wide variety of frameworks. In this manner for example a service provider can provide secure access to system resources to third party frameworks and other middleware offerings. Such offerings may include by way of example and without limitation AA AF Apple iOS Microsoft S J applets and like side by side technologies. The framework aggregator may include a set of tailored operating system libraries and HTML capabilities to support such technologies as well as user interface web engine access etc.

In certain embodiments user interfaces supported by the framework aggregator may enable a user to launch applications supported by an Android framework. For example the framework aggregator may offer a series of buttons including an Android button that provides a visual display of available Android applications. Further the Android framework and framework aggregator may share a graphics screen. In this manner it may not be necessary to port functionality into the Android framework that might otherwise be necessary. It is noted that in a given device an Android framework may be built using a different tool chain than that utilized by other frameworks supported by the framework aggregator .

Using an example involving a web browser the portion of the browser that executes potentially unsafe Flash or JavaScript code such as a rendering engine can be executed in the untrusted virtual machine container with limited file system and peripheral access while the portion of the browser that has access to underlying platform hardware and sensitive operating system resources can be executed in one or more trusted virtual machine containers . In further embodiments the trusted portion may comprise a secure clone of a framework or modified version of a framework that supports secure applications and or secure portions of applications. In such embodiments unsecure applications or portions thereof may be executed by portions of a framework residing in an untrusted or restricted user domain or container. As discussed above various approaches to hardware sandboxing may be employed to further isolate untrusted portions of a framework and to support restricted operating system domains or environments.

The secure Linux kernel environment of this embodiment includes a secure access kernel driver and an access server that provides a full access interface to support trusted user mode functionality and a guest access interface to support untrusted user mode functionality. Full host Linux services access and minimal guest Linux services access are provided to the trusted and untrusted user mode environments respectively. As above the trusted user mode environment can be supported by a full host root filesystem while a minimal guest root filesystem on a separate partition or disk supports the untrusted user mode environment.

In one exemplary embodiment the primary set top box application is constructed as an Android application executed in a virtual machine container s . Depending on the capabilities of the relevant Android framework non standard API s or libraries may be required to support certain set top box functionality such as PVR picture in picture transcoding and channel tuning operations. Further this approach may require special interfacing e.g. passing a string to an interface to create an encode path as part of a hardware call or provision of non standard functions or even applications to address services and functions that may be lacking in a relevant framework or required for certification. For example an Android framework might be extended to include non standard functionality without negatively impacting compatibility by providing services that are hidden under the Android porting layers and receive and interpret uniform resource identifiers URIs passed through such layers.

In other embodiments instead of an end to end security definition being managed by the source or being defined by the content itself or associated metadata each application that is downloaded or preinstalled includes a full security definition. For example each application may have its own downloadable conditional access security dCAS or downloadable DRM element definition. A corresponding certification process might entail for example certifying a part of an overall secure pathway with one or more applications providing the final portion of the certification. Alternatively a predefined plurality of conditional access mechanisms may be provided with a downloaded application defining which mechanism is to be used. It may then be possible to certify a secure boundary without regard to the conditional access requirements of a particular company or media.

In various embodiments a set top box or like device may exchange capabilities with other devices in a media consumption network e.g. PVR s DVD players access points televisions computing devices smartphones etc. to compare against the requirements of an application. Once this is done the application may select which one or more modes of operation if any that it will permit. If the set top box cannot support such modes due to resource competition or otherwise such modes become unavailable. If available a set of modes of operation can be selected and dynamically switched to other of such modes on the fly during a media stream delivery which may require coordination with the application or the source to support the transition possibly requiring quality changes in the media stream .

For example the SMP Linux kernel can perform load balancing for processes in both virtual machines across multiple CPU threads or cores when maximum performance is desired. Further a host virtual machine with control of a guest virtual machine can terminate and restart a process in the guest virtual machine or the entire container if it misbehaves or is compromised. Hard limits can be placed on CPU utilization by a guest virtual machine in order to prevent disruption of core underlying device functionality and to facilitate termination of runaway processes. In operation separate threads may have segregated and or restricted access to an I D cache and L2 cache .

Referring more particularly to the figure the SMP Linux kernel functions to control hardware and lock a guest virtual machine s instance of Linux running untrusted applications and a host virtual machine s running trusted application core services to one or more separate threads 1 4 based on performance and or security isolation requirements. For example an untrusted application might be executed in a virtual machine container that spans both CPU1 and CPU2. As described more fully below various portions of I D caches and and L2 cache may be restricted to a particular thread or CPU or shared with appropriate safeguards.

In one embodiment CPU1 and CPU2 are both segregated into separate and distinct zones when in a sandboxing mode. In another embodiment the trusted CPU1 is set up having its own segregated regions of memory and also given access rights over some or all address ranges of memory mapped portions of CPU2. Generally when operating in separate or segregated zones environments or domains the two CPUs operate on different applications so that CPU1 executes one set of instructions while CPU2 executes a different set of instructions. Segregation or separation of this nature is typically referred to as sandboxing or sandbox mode. The purpose of most sandboxing is to prevent one zone from accessing functionality in the other zone or to have controlled access of one zone into another. In some instances both zones may be limited from having access to the other zone or only have controlled access between zones. In some applications one zone may be regarded as a secure privileged or trusted zone and the other as a restricted non secure or non trusted zone in which access by the applications operating on the non secure zone are prevented or controlled from accessing certain applications running in the secure zone.

As noted above a number of devices utilize multiple processors or processing cores to run separate programs applications etc. In a situation where one zone is not to have access to a second zone one way to ensure this separation is by checking the accesses to the system memory. That is by ensuring accesses that are allocated to CPU1 are not accessed by CPU2 unless the location of the access is a shared location applications running on CPU2 may be prevented from breaching the functional separation. One way to achieve this protection is to provide an access check and access control to ensure that the correct processing module is accessing a permitted location for that processing module. In the illustrated embodiment CPU1 and CPU2 may communicate directly through a network socket IPC calls etc.

The STB gateway of the illustrated embodiment interacts with a residential network infrastructure and external media systems via one or more wired and wireless networks links. The wired and wireless networks links may utilize one or more of various transmission media such as coaxial cable shielded twisted pair cable fiber optic cable power line wires and wireless media radio frequencies microwave satellite infrared etc. and operate in accordance with a variety of communication and networking protocols TCP IP UPnP IPv6 etc. . In addition the wired and wireless networks links may comprise a multi hop network utilizing a spanning tree protocol direct wireless connections peer to peer links etc.

The front end comprises tuner circuitry operable to isolate particular channels. Signals from the tuner circuitry are then provided to analog to digital ADC circuitry and demodulation circuitry for conversion into binary format stream. Once in binary format forward error correction FEC circuitry checks the integrity of the received binary stream. Audio video and data extracted from the binary stream may then be decoded e.g. by decoding into formats suitable for consumption by downstream devices. It is noted that demodulation circuitry may support one or more modulation techniques such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing COFDM etc.
