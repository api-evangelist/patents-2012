This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 61 453 868 filed Mar. 17 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE AC02 06CH11357 between the United States Government and the UChicago Argonne LLC representing Argonne National Laboratory.

This invention relates generally to the field of remote radiation detection. More particularly this invention relates to systems and methods for remotely detecting radiation via electromagnetic scattering from radiation induced ionization in air.

This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is inter alia recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated herein what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Electromagnetic wave remote sensing of earth resources and weather has been studied in the past decades. For example radar sensing is used in oil and mineral exploration as well as in monitoring and predicting weather. In addition to these uses remote detection of nuclear radiation is theoretically possible via electromagnetic wave sensing because radiation induced ionization in air increases radar reflectivity. Despite this ionization phenomenon and its associated applications there has been little research on remote sensing of ionized air.

From a theoretical standpoint the use of electromagnetic waves in detecting radioactive plumes from nuclear power plant operations has been investigated. Various works have reported radar cross section RCS of microwave scattering from charged dielectric spheres. From an experimental standpoint an X band Russian radar detected and tracked radioactive plumes from the 1986 Chernobyl accident. As a result of these experiments the correlation between radioactivity and radar cross section was determined by calibrated measurements. Despite this work the underlying physics has not been well established as a result the scientific community has viewed these results with little confidence. In spite of these initial experimental correlations it has been found that existing simple plasma models under predict the RCS by several orders of magnitude. In addition to the lack of understanding surrounding the correlation between radioactivity and radar cross section current radiation detectors based on air sampling e.g. ionization counters scintillators and semiconductors are not effective from long distances because of dilution and atmospheric dispersion. Specifically the limited range of conventional detectors is because of small penetration lengths of alpha and beta particles in air and a decrease of neutrons and gamma rays with the inverse of the square of the distance from the source. Consequently such systems are limited to a detection range of approximately 100 meters. Thus although the impact of radiation on electromagnetic waves in air has been generally understood there is a need for a method and system for utilizing such a relationship without the need for close proximity to the radiation i.e. a remote detection mechanism.

The present invention provides a system and method for remotely detecting and monitoring airborne nuclear radiation using millimeter wave technology. It is desirable to overcome the limitations of current radar radiation detection research which either lacks understanding in the scientific community or is unable to accurately detect radiation. It is also desirable to overcome the limited detection range of conventional detectors.

Various embodiments of the millimeter wave radiation detection system of the present invention may be applied among other uses to far field proliferation detection of nuclear facilities and fuel processing operations nuclear materials movement leaks of radioactive materials and emergency response planning. The system may have meteorological uses such as aiding in understanding cloud and rain formation and in early monitoring of thunderstorms.

These and other advantages and features of the invention together with the organization and manner of operation thereof will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.

Whereas microwave radar is known to detect highly dense charged columns of air from lightning meteors etc. due to a higher plasma frequency than the incident radar frequency there have been only limited studies on radar detection of weakly ionized air.

A millimeter wave measurement system has been developed for remote detection of airborne nuclear radiation based on electromagnetic scattering from radiation induced ionization in air. Specifically methods of monitoring radiation induced ionization of air have been investigated and the ionized air has been identified as a source of millimeter wave radar reflection which can be utilized to determine the size and strength of a radiation source.

Atoms consist of relatively large particles comprised of protons and neutrons orbited by negatively charged electrons. Under normal circumstances atoms consist of equal numbers of protons and electrons so the atom is neutrally charged. An ion is any atom or molecule that does not have the normal number of electrons which means it is not neutrally charged. Ionizing radiation is any form of radiation that has sufficient energy to knock electrons away from atoms thereby creating ions.

Radiation specifically ionizing radiation will result in changes to air that is contacted by the radiation. Put differently the radiation induced ionization of air consists of a progression of mechanistic steps from the formation of plasma to molecular aerosols to microdroplet clouds. illustrates one representation of the resultant changes to air that is exposed to ionizing radiation. The radiation source will emit ionizing radiation as energetic particles or waves including alpha particles beta particles gamma rays and x rays. The emitted ionizing radiation will result in an ion production rate q in the air that is contacted. The ionization of the air results in the air ionizing into plasma with free electrons. Specifically the ionization of air produces O2 and N2 with the corresponding free e . The free electron attaches quickly lifetime of 10 6 s to O2 becoming O2 . Depending on the water content in the air such as measured by relative humidity hydration will occur. The hydration with water vapor results in cluster ions such as O2 H2O n NO3 H2O n H3O H2O n and NO2 H2O n where n depends on humidity and can be as much as 20. These are called small and large ions. The ions can charge the neutral aerosols in the air as well as form ion nucleated ultrafine aerosols 1 2 nm in the air. The charge induced aerosols tend to coagulate and grow to the size of cloud condensation nuclei 100 nm that activate cloud droplets 10 20 m . Condensation will occur when a sufficient saturation of the air with water is present. Thus absent sufficient water in the air the progression as shown in will not proceed to formation of microdroplets.

Phenomenologically radiation induced ionization of air can be divided into three models 1 plasma 2 aerosol and 3 droplet. Each of these models provides an opportunity for use in detection of the underlying radiation. Previous work has investigated and estimated the radar cross section of the plasma and droplet models and suggests that neither model is appropriate for remotely detecting radiation for the following reasons. The plasma model provides measureable radar cross section at radiowave to low microwave frequencies for electron plasma. However the plasma cloud effects are not sustainable because free electrons in the air produced by the radioactive sources quickly attach to the O2 molecules. Thus the use of the plasma model provides an ineffective mechanism by which to detect radiation. The cloud droplet model provides measureable radar cross section. This includes radar cross sections determined using millimeter frequencies due to the sixth power size dependence on scattering. However because droplet formation is more likely to occur under supersaturated conditions the droplet model may not be appropriate for radar detection at low altitudes and is unacceptably dependent on the water content of the air to be monitored

Thus in one embodiment a method of determining the scattering of millimeter waves may be utilized to determine the radiation of a monitored area having a high humidity. illustrates one such embodiment where the radiation dose emits radiation to impact a portion of air resulting in ionization of the air as explained above. The ionized air interacts with the water vapor to form a charged cloud i.e. a collection of associated charged water microdroplets. A millimeter wave emitter directs a millimeter wave at the charged water cloud. A portion of the millimeter waves are reflected back after having interacted with the charged cloud. The detection of this reflected electromagnetic energy can thus be utilized to determine the underlying radiation s properties that resulted in the detected charged cloud.

Based on the drawbacks of the plasma and droplet models the ion cluster aerosol model is most likely to produce enhanced radar scattering of radiation induced ionization that can be harnessed via a detection scheme to provide information regarding the radiation content of the monitored area. This radiation induced ionization phenomenon has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally as is further explained below both prophetically and in experimental results.

In one embodiment the system and methods of the invention may be used to remotely detect and locate nuclear processing facilities such as those operating covertly. Krypton 85 85Kr is released in relatively large quantities 4 mCi s during dissolution of spent fuels. Conventional radiation detectors rely upon air sampling which is not effective from a long range due to dilution and atmospheric dispersion. Use of a system such as illustrated in provides an indication of ionization of the air around a facility due to the release of the 85Kr.

Modeling and experimental results indicate the strongest mechanistic evidence for radar detection. If millimeter wave radar can provide measurable scattering signals from ionization clouds in air created by radioactive particles and photons then it would offer a remote detection mechanism. While this technique does not provide radioisotope information it can determine the location and level of radioactivity from nuclear materials or radioactive plumes. The ability to remotely detect radioactivity via radar would be useful in many areas including the following proliferation detection of nuclear facilities and fuel processing operations nuclear materials movement leaks of radioactive materials and emergency response planning.

The ion density in the air due to radioactivity can be calculated using the received data. Ion growth is described by the following second order nonlinear differential equations 

System and methods are described herein that utilize the scattering of MMW from the air containing water which increases when the air is irradiated with negative charges. In one embodiment the application of these systems and methods is further explained below using a classical electrodynamics model of scattering from a dielectric sphere with diffusion deposited mobile surface charge. In this model scattering and extinction cross sections are calculated for a charged particle with the effective dielectric constant that consists of the volume dielectric function of the neutral sphere and the surface dielectric function due to the oscillation of the surface charge. The surface dielectric function was obtained from the damped harmonic motion model of an electron. Using the double Debye model of frequency and temperature dependent permittivity of bulk water as a model of dielectric water sphere. The number of charges was calculated using the model of atmospheric diffusion charging which estimates the steady state average number of charges on a water droplet as a linear function of the droplet radius. To calculate the temperature dependent damping constant the classical mechanics model of a linear viscous drag on a particle in water was introduced to the calculations.

Potential applications of this work may include the ability to remotely detect the presence of radioactive gases that are emitted as byproducts of nuclear fuel cycle reactions. Such radionuclides have no distinct spectral lines in the EM spectrum. Atmospheric non equilibrium cold plasma produced by radioactive decay of unstable isotopes has typical plasma frequency in the kHz band and it was highly unstable due to recombination and diffusion. On the other hand the capacitive action of atmospheric fog water droplets to absorb and store charges provided there was a difference in the scattering properties related to charge may enable remote detection of radionuclides with MMW. A similar hypothesis was presented in where formation of a large number of charged atmospheric water clusters following release of nuclear radiation was predicted but the mechanism of scattering was not presented.

A schematic drawing of the experimental setup is shown in . A NIG was used to generate ionized air on the order of 1 million negative ions per cubic cm at a distance of about 40 cm away from the Negative Ion Generator NIG needle. The ion density depends on the distance from the NIG needle which was biased at 18 kV. To perform microwave scattering measurements Agilent PNA X series Model N5245A Vector Network Analyzer VNA was used to sweep frequency and record the network scattering parameter S from 26.5 GHz to 40 GHz Ka band . A pair of Ka band standard gain rectangular horn antennas Narda Microwave East was used for emission and detection of microwaves. Dielectric lenses were used with each horn antenna to increase the gain of antenna radiation pattern. A computer controlled relay switch was used to turn the NIG on and off which allowed for making time gated transient measurements. The emitter and receiver antennas were placed side by side for bistatic mode detection. The two antennas were separated by a distance of 30 cm to reduce electromagnetic coupling and each was focused at the tip of the NIG needle approximately 1.5 m away. The S signal was collected by the VNA and transferred to a Personal Computer PC through a GPIB interface. A LabVIEW Graphics User Interface GUI data acquisition program was used to view the experimental observations in real time.

The VNA can be calibrated at an arbitrary reference plane in a closed cable system using the Short Open Load Through SOLT calibration method. In one experiment the VNA was used to interrogate an open air space between two antennas where one must take into account the stray fields due to the coupling of the emitter and receiver antenna signals and the background reflection. Furthermore the frequency response of the whole measurement system must be known to determine the absolute RCS.

For a plane wave incident upon an infinite dielectric slab of thickness t the RCS for an incident beam area of A ais related to the Power Reflection Coefficient PRC as

From Eq. 2 the true reflection coefficient was obtained as 

where Sis the measured background signal when the NIG is off. To obtain ET f a large piece of metal reflector was placed at the center position of ionized air which has reflection r 1 for all frequencies. Let Sdenote the measurement data from the metal reflector. From Eq. 2 the following results 1 4 from which the following results . 5 Combining Eq. 3 and Eq. 5 the calibrated reflection coefficient was as follows

A calibration was performed on a Teflon slab of thickness t 18 mm and compared it with the theoretical result. For plane wave normal incidence the reflection coefficient ris 

where 2.3215 and kare dielectric constant and wave vector of Teflon respectively. A good agreement between the theoretical and measured data was obtained as in .

The RCS per m2 obtained from Eq. 7 of the ionized air when NIG was on and off for three cycles. It should be appreciated that the RCS per volume can be obtained through Eq. 8 with t m twice the radius of the ionized air .

The measured RCS per m2 in the Ka band 26.5 GHz to 40 GHz is given in for three NIG on off cycles. When the ionized air was present the RCS per m2 increases and was on the order of 10 10 m2 over the whole band. This level of RCS per m2 can be detected by current radar systems.

Averaging the change of RCS per m2 when the NIG was on from that when the NIG was off for the three NIG on off cycles the averaged RCS per m2 in Ka band is shown in .

Thomson scattering arises from acceleration of free electrons by the incident electric field. The electron density in the ionized air is on the order of 10 cmwhich gives an average spacing between adjacent electrons d 0.0022 cm much smaller than the wavelength 1 cm of at a frequency of f 30 GHz. In this case i.e. within one wavelength scale the scattered field for a unit plane wave incidence is given by

Thus the total scattering depends quadratically on the Fourier transform component of the electron density profile. It is possible to calculate an estimate for the time averaged back scattering RCS right arrow over k right arrow over k 2k for an assumed electron density distribution of 0 1 12 

where is the Gamma function. gives the calculated RCS according to Eq. 13 for different which agrees well with the measured RCS in

The observed microwave reflection from ionized air using NIG as the source of ionization RCS on the order of 10 10mwas measured over the whole Ka band 26.5 GHz to 40 GHz in room air for a charge density of 1 million per cm3 at a distance of 40 cm from NIG needles.

Millimeter wave MMW scattering from both charged and uncharged water droplets was investigated. The droplets were produced in the laboratory with an ultrasonic atomizer. Diffusion charging of the droplets was accomplished with a negative ion generator NIG . Two types of charged droplet experiments were investigated 1 while an ultrasonic generated mist was flowing across the MMW beam path the mist was charged with the NIG the convective approach and 2 the air was saturated with mist and then charge the humid air with the NIG the diffusion approach . In the convective approach charged mist flows away from the MMW beam after the NIG is turned off so the on and off implies charged versus neutral clearly. In the diffusion approach which is representative of humid air water droplets in humid air are diffusively charged the charges are expected to be neutralized quickly after the NIG is turned off by diffusion and collision with neutral molecules.

The millimeter wave transmission and reflection of charged and neutral mists was studied using the setup given in . The millimeter wave setup consisted of a 94 GHz radiation transmitted and received in open air between a pair of Standard Gain horns. A Gunn diode oscillator was used to generate continuous waves and a pair of Schottky diode detectors was used to measure the transmitted reflected power. An ultrasonic atomizer UA commercial room humidifier generated a plume of fine mist in the beam path of millimeter waves. Deionized distilled water was used to produce a neutral mist. The UA produced a room temperature mist which eliminated the possibility of MMW scattering due to thermal gradient. The mist was diffusion charged using a negative ion generator NIG by applying a high voltage 18 kV in parallel at the tips of several wires pointed in the air. Tips of the NIG wires were placed in the middle of the UA generated mist. NIG was acting as a cold cathode emitting electrons which are quickly absorbed by air molecules to form air ions. In the experimental setup the tip of the NIG was in immediate proximity to the mist thus it is assumed that free electrons were charging the mist.

The 94 GHz millimeter wave transmitter supplies a beam of radiation that scatters neutral and charged water droplets produced by an ultrasonic atomizer. Millimeter wave scattering is monitored with a reflection detector sensor. Millimeter wave transmission through the droplets is monitored with a transmission detector sensor. Both the reflection and transmission sensors convert the physical phenomenon each sensor is monitoring into a measureable electrical signal such as voltage or current. An oscilloscope displays the electrical signals produced by the reflection and transmission detectors. A data acquisition system DAQ converts the analog output signals from the reflection and transmission sensors into a digital signal for processing by a computer. The DAQ includes data acquisition hardware which primarily acts as the device for digitizing incoming analog signals. The DAQ may also include signal conditioning circuitry in applications where the sensors generate signals that are too difficult or too dangerous to be measured directly with the data acquisition device. The DAQ output is inputted into a computer for processing.

Several experiments were conducted to test the MMW scattering properties of charged versus neutral mist. The experiments were performed for two scenarios continuously flowing convective and diffusive mist and stationary diffusive only mist. In the case of the flowing mist measurements were made while the UA was continuously operating. In the case of the stationary mist UA would be humidifying the air in the setup for several minutes but measurements were taken immediately after the UA was turned off. The test scheme for either case consisted of monitoring the change in millimeter wave transmitted and reflected signals integrated over 1 s intervals for a time sequence of NIG turning on and off. First it was determined that in the dry air MMW transmission or reflection was not changing to a measurable level when NIG was turning on or off. Next with the flowing mist a consistently higher transmission of MMW through the mist was observed when NIG was on charged mist compared to the case when the NIG was off neutral mist . gives a plot for a typical case of the measured MMW transmitted intensity T in arbitrary units a.u. as a function of time. displays corresponding time readings of a charge counter placed next to the setup. The same measurements were repeated for the stationary mist case. The results for detected MMW transmitted intensity T a.u. are plotted in and the corresponding time readings of the charge counter are displayed in . In order to detect backscattered MMW a receiver antenna and detector coupled to a low noise 20 dB preamplifier were placed next to the emitter antenna bistatic geometry . The results for detected MMW reflected intensity R a.u. from flowing mist are plotted in and reflected intensity measurements for stationary mist are plotted in

It can be seen from the counter readings during the off cycles of NIG in and that the mist does not carry a significant amount of charge. and indicated that relative changes in MMW forward scattering amplitude in response to mist charging for either flowing or stationary mist are approximately the same. Similarly and indicate that relative changes in MMW backscattering amplitude in response to ionization are approximately the same for flowing and stationary mist cases. Compared to previous studies of MMW scattering from charged cardboard cylinder for the case of charged humid air the amplitudes of MMW forward and backscattering scattering signal changes are smaller but the response time was faster. Also in the prior art reflection and transmission signals were considered on the same order of magnitude while in scattering from charged mist backscattering is two orders of magnitude smaller than forward scattering.

In general electromagnetic scattering from random medium such as mist changes if the dielectric properties of the medium change in response to external stimulus. In one case refractive index distribution function of the medium changes i.e. average value of refractive index is the same but internal structure of the medium changes. In another case average refractive index of the medium changes at the molecular level i.e. dielectric polarizability of the medium changes. Both processes mentioned above can contribute to observed change in forward and backscattering of MMW from mist in response to ionization.

In order to interpret the experimental results the scattering and extinction cross section of the charged and uncharged water droplets were studied. Radar scattering and extinction cross section efficiencies of sub micron size spherical droplets for incident MMW follow the Rayleigh law 8 3 1 2 14 41 1 2 15 

where is the radius of the particle x 2 the size parameter. Note that for a small value of the size parameter x extinction is approximately equal to absorption. The effective dielectric function is 16 

where v f T was the frequency and temperature dependent volume dielectric constant of bulk water and s f T the frequency and temperature dependent surface dielectric constant. A well accepted phenomenological double Debye model of frequency and temperature dependent dielectric properties of water was used which was valid in the spectral range from 1 GH to 1 THz and temperature range 20 to 60 C. For laboratory conditions of T 20 C. and f 94 GHz this model gives the value of the dielectric constant v 7.69 i13.32.

A model based on classical electrodynamics theory of scattering from a dielectric sphere with diffusion deposited mobile surface charge provides an explanation of the example results. In this approach scattering and extinction cross sections are calculated for a charged Rayleigh particle with effective dielectric constant consisting of the volume dielectric function of the neutral sphere and surface dielectric function due to the oscillation of the surface charge in the presence of applied electric field. For small droplets with radius smaller than 100 nm this model predicts increased MMW scattering from charged mist which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. It should be appreciated that this example supports the above described indirect remote sensing of radioactive gases via their charging action on atmospheric humid air.

Diffusion charging of a dielectric sphere due to an external source of charges deposits a layer of surface electrons on the sphere. Electrons are confined to the single molecule thick top most layer of the dielectric water sphere. Existing models of aerosol diffusion charging suggest that the average number of charges may be proportional to the radius or the square of the radius of the droplet. The microscopic electrostatic model of water charging supports the linear dependence law. On the surface of a microdroplet polar water molecules are oriented so that oxygen atoms with excess negative charge point inward while hydrogen atoms with excess positive charge point outward. Thus the surface of a microdroplet can be considered as a collection of dipoles with the same orientation where the potential difference between the layer of positive charge on the surface and the layer of negative charge just below the surface is 0.5 V. The value of 0.25 V is quoted in the prior art however more recent results from molecular dynamics MD simulations suggest that 0.5 V . Therefore a water microdroplet acts as a capacitor that can accumulate a net negative surface charge. In the steady state diffusion charging deposits a net average negative charge 4 17 

where is the free space permittivity and the radius. Hence the total average number of mobile surface electrons can be estimated as with 0.5 V 2 18 

To calculate the response of charged droplets a classical electrodynamics based modified Mie model of scattering from a dielectric sphere with free surface charge was considered. Modification to conventional Mie theory is obtained via the equation of continuity of tangential magnetic fields at the boundary of the sphere 19 

where right arrow over K is the surface current density which can be related to the mobile surface charge as 20 

where is surface conductivity Et the tangential component of the applied EM field at radial frequency ps surface charge density and u the tangential velocity of the charge carriers. The former can be calculated using the damped driven oscillator model. The equation of motion of mobile surface charge acted upon by the driving force eEeand velocity dependent resistive force is given as 21 

where e is the charge of electron me the mass of electron and y b me the phenomenological damping constant. Note that this model assumes continuum surface charge density which is correct for microscopic sphere. In the nanoscale regime however the sphere has a discrete number of surface charges and Coulomb electron electron repulsion may need to be accounted for. These corrections will be introduced into the model in our future work.

To obtain the Rayleigh cross section the modified Mie coefficients can be expanded in power series in the size parameter and retaining the lowest order term. Then it has been shown in that the surface dielectric function is 22 

where N is the total number of mobile surface charges. Thus critically depends on the values of N and y. Using the expression for N obtained in Eq. 18 provides 24 so that 1 

Previously it has been suggested to approximate the temperature dependent damping constant using an empirical expression T kT h where kis the Boltzmann constant and h is Planck s constant. However this model does not relate the damping constant to the properties of the medium. To accommodate this a classical mechanics model of the temperature dependent damping constant T was developed wherein the electron is treated as a classical spherical particle that has a classical electron radius Lorentz radius of 4 25 

which has the numerical value r2.82 10m. Using the equation for linear viscous drag for a particle in water the coefficient of resistive force in Eq. 21 is 6 26 

where r is the Stokes radius of the particle which for a spherical particle is the same as the radius of the particle and the temperature dependent fluid viscosity. Thus the damping constant in Eq. 21 for the electron in water is 6 27 

Using the model described above ratios of scattering and extinction cross sections efficiencies of charged to uncharged water droplets with radii 5 nm

In order to gain a better understanding of the model the real and imaginary components of the surface dielectric function are plotted as a function of the size parameter x for water droplets with radii 5 nm

This explains why 1m Re for small droplets but with an increase in size 1m 0. Note also that for small droplets 1m Re and 1m 1m . The quantity in brackets in Eqs. 14 and 15 are labeled as having the numerical value 0.82 i0.15 for uncharged droplets and 1 2 30 

The results of the numerical experiments indicate that no significant sensitivity of the scattering and absorption cross sections to surface charge was observable for droplets larger than approximately 100 nm. For droplets smaller than approximately 5 nm our model predicts that no surface charges will be deposited. On the other hand existing models and experimental observations indicate that most droplets produced by UA mist generators have sizes larger than 1 m. The scattering model described herein assumes a continuum surface charge model. For a continuum metal like surface charge Coulomb repulsion forces may be ignored and drift of charges in the external field may be approximated as surface current. However small droplets carry a discrete number of surface charges where Coulomb repulsion cannot be ignored. Further the examples given above ignore thermal effects. At ambient temperature energy of thermal fluctuations kT exceeds the energy of the driving force of applied electromagnetic field. The model damping constant presented above is an empirical one. Thus it should be appreciated that the temperature of the water droplets may impact these results.

Increased forward and backscattering of 94 GHz millimeter wave MMW from charged mist as compared to MMW scattering from neutral mist has been observed. Comparison of the neutral and charged droplet experiments reveals increased transmission of MMW through charged mist as compared to uncharged mist. Specifically experimental results indicate that charged mist is more transparent to millimeter waves than the uncharged mist. Note that flowing mist also produces some ionization count. Experimental results also indicate that charged droplets in humid air are more transparent to millimeter waves than the uncharged droplets. Ambient temperature mist was produced from de ionized water with an ultrasonic atomizer UA and charging was accomplished with a negative ion generator NIG placed near the mist. The model described herein predicts increased forward scattering and increased backscattering of MMW from small droplets which qualitatively agrees with the observed experimental results. However charging is predicted to affect droplets in the size range below 100 nm while the current literature on UA generated mist suggests that sizes of most droplets are above 1 m.

Previously the mechanism of scattering due to water droplets has not been completely understood. It is believed that because at room and atmospheric humidity levels surfaces of most dielectrics are covered with thin layer of water the problem may be reduced to the understanding of charged water interaction with EM waves. It is currently believed that two plausible mechanisms may explain the microwave interaction of air ionization a coherent Thomson scattering from free electrons released from ionization and b scattering from charged water microdroplets as they may form from ion nucleated water clustering. The charged droplet scattering may be the case in atmospheric air as discussed above. It is believed the coherent Thomson scattering may explain the present measurements in room air.

A field test setup is illustrated in . A millimeter wave mmW sensor at 94 GHz measures reflected signals from radiation induced atmospheric events at short standoff distances. A Gunn diode oscillator generates continuous wave mmW radiation at a power level of 60 mW. An isolator may be provided to shield input equipment. A 20 dB directional coupler transmits 99 percent of the mmW power which is radiated out by a lens antenna and directed at the target . The remaining 1 of the power is fed to the reference channel of a homodyne mixer . The reflected signal from the target is collected by a second lens antenna and fed to the measurement channel of the homodyne mixer . A processing component such as a computer can be used for signal analysis and processing. The target signal is converted into in phase I and quadrature phase Q components with respect to the reference signal. The I and Q components of the target signal may be used to measure amplitude and phase of backscattered signals from the target as well as Doppler frequency shift if the target is moving relative to the mmW beam. The Doppler frequency shift f of a moving target is given by 2 where is the carrier wavelength and is the radial velocity of the target along the beam direction.

In one test scenario utilize the above described setup the I Q sensor was deployed in a field test at a standoff distance of 2m. A low energy X Ray source was used to ionize the air in front of the I Q sensor. The mmW backscattered signals were measured for the cases when the X Ray source was turned on and off. As and show a Doppler frequency shift was observed around 500 Hz when the X Ray source was on and the shift disappeared when the X Ray was off. This was confirmed by several measurements for different scenarios 1 X Ray tube pointed up toward the beam 2 downward toward the ground and 3 mmW beam directed away from the plume. In order to confirm the detection a mobile radar operating on similar principle as mmW sensor at 10 GHz which was also deployed at the test from 100 m away. The 10 GHz radar aimed at the target from a different angle also observed this Doppler feature. The fact that both the 94 GHz and 10 GHz radars simultaneously detected this feature after frequency scaling adds confidence to the detection event.
