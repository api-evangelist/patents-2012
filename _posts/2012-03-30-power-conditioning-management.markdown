This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 476 231 entitled Web Enabled Power Conditioning Management System filed Apr. 15 2011 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Power conditioning devices or simply power conditioners are used to improve the quality of electricity provided to equipment connected thereto such as to ensure a substantially constant sinusoidal alternating current AC wave over varying supply conditions. It is to be understood that the term power refers to electrical power provided to and drawn by a load and to electricity i.e. voltage and current. The meaning of the term will be clear from the context in which it is used herein.

Electricity provided by a power conditioner may be filtered to remove various noise components and may be limited clamped or diverted to prevent spikes and voltage surges from entering the protected equipment. Power conditioners may use filter circuits to filter out noise signals from the AC supply voltage and suppressor circuits to suppress transients surges from the AC supply voltage thereby limiting these potentially disruptive damaging conditions from reaching connected equipment. Such power conditioners may have multiple outlets to which the equipment can be connected and through which the conditioned power may be provided. In certain systems the connected load equipment is treated as a single load i.e. a voltage surge in the supply power is prevented from entering all connected equipment. However a heavy draw of power by a single load may interrupt power to loads connected to outputs of the power conditioner. Thus the requirements of individual load equipment cannot be accommodated by a single power conditioner. While this may present little impediment in certain applications other applications would require multiple power conditioners to satisfy the requirements of multiple loads even when these loads are in close proximity to each other. There is thus an apparent need for control over individual outlets and the power drawn therefrom and for means by which such control may be monitored and modified from a central location.

Instructions are stored on a power conditioning device that when executed by a processor on a remote device generates a set of user controls on a user interface thereof. The instructions are retrieved from the power conditioning device and executed on the remote device to generate the user controls. One or more criteria such as threshold values are specified through the user controls such that when a process variable such as voltage current temperature etc. meets the criteria an action is compelled on the power conditioning device. Physical quantities are measured and corresponding values are assigned to the process variables. The action specified through the user controls is performed upon the criterion being met.

The above and still further features and advantages of the present inventive concept will become apparent upon consideration of the following definitions descriptions and descriptive figures of specific embodiments thereof. While these descriptions go into specific details of certain embodiments of the inventive concept it is to be understood that variations may and do exist and will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure.

The present inventive concept is best described through certain embodiments thereof which are described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like features throughout. It is to be understood that the term invention when used herein is intended to connote the inventive concept underlying the embodiments described below and not merely the embodiments themselves. It is to be understood further that the general inventive concept is not limited to the illustrative embodiments described below and the following descriptions should be read in such light.

Additionally it is to be understood that the term exemplary when used herein is intended to mean serving as or providing an example of or a typical instance. Particular quality or fitness of the examples indicated herein as exemplary is neither intended nor should be inferred.

The system described herein is a power conditioning management system that provides the capability to customize create and monitor individual outlet and power settings on integrated network addressable power conditioning devices via remote access. Users can create and run sophisticated custom sequences from a remote device and receive notifications based on user defined predetermined conditions and thresholds including for example outlet status current draw power consumption and ambient temperature. Automated power up down of selected components may be performed per a customized schedule.

As used herein power conditioning refers to processing of electricity to increase its quality at a load device and to minimize the possibility of damage to both the load device and the power conditioning components due to abnormal characteristics of the electricity. It is to be noted that the terms power and electricity are used herein synonymously although it is to be understood that such is not strictly the case. Electric power is the rate of transfer of electric energy whereas electricity is a phenomenon resulting from the presence and flow of electric charge. The ordinarily skilled artisan will readily be capable of determining the proper meaning of the terms power and electricity from the context in which the terms are used herein.

Referring first to there is illustrated an exemplary power conditioning system PCS that may provide protection and power conditioning to external loads not illustrated . At the outset it is to be understood that is a schematic block diagram illustrating various functional modules for purposes of description and explanation. The diagram is not intended to serve as an electrical schematic and interconnections illustrated are merely to depict various interoperations between functional components and or processes and such interconnections are not intended to imply direct electrical connections between such components nor should such be inferred. Moreover the functionality illustrated and described in as separate components need not be distributed as shown and the discrete blocks in the diagram are not intended to depict discrete electrical components.

PCS may be contained in a rackmount enclosure representatively illustrated by panel . In one application PCS is embodied to properly protect audio visual AV equipment from alternating current AC supply surges and transients that can disrupt sound quality and digital performance. PCS may include elements that provide common mode and normal mode impedance tolerant EMI RFI filtering inrush current elimination and catastrophic over under voltage shutdown.

PCS may be electrically coupled to a power source not illustrated at input terminals L for an AC line conductor N for an AC neutral conductor and G for a ground conductor. PCS may include a plurality of outlets representatively illustrated at outlet from which electrical loads electrically coupled thereto receive electrical power. The input terminals L N and G and the outlets may be accessible from the exterior of the enclosure . It is to be understood that while PCS is illustrated as a single phase AC power control system other input configurations including multiphase AC can be used in conjunction with the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

Outlets may be independently controlled to for example selectively connect and disconnect the connected loads to and from the input power based on a selectively defined threshold. Such control may be in response to system default behavior such as an AC supply transient surge in the input power a level of power consumption in one or more of the connected loads or due to a user programmed behavior as will be described in more detail below. To that end each outlet may be controlled on an individual independent basis by an associated outlet controller representatively illustrated at outlet controller . Outlet controller may be operated by a signal from power controller such as for example in response to an input transient surge or a global power scheme. Additionally outlet controllers may also control outlets to which they are respectively associated. For example outlet controller may provide monitoring of the corresponding outlet and perform some action based on some outlet condition such as for example disconnecting the load in response to high power consumption.

Power controller may provide system wide power control in accordance with which power is provided to outlets . To that end power controller may be provided data from sources throughout the system from which control decisions can be made. For example the input power may be conditioned by a suitable power conditioner and provided to a power monitor . Power monitor may in turn provide data to power controller indicative of voltage and or current levels of the input power. Power controller may compare the power levels with decision criteria the results of such may compel appropriate action to be taken. Additionally PCS may include one or more environmental sensors such as those that convert temperature humidity vibration and the like into electrical signals. Data indicative of such signals may be provided to power controller

Additionally power controller may perform certain actions that have been programmed by a user. For example PCS may incorporate an Application Programming Interface API comprising a set of commands and or procedures that allow a user to customize the system performance where such performance can be controlled at the outlet level. The user may utilize the API to construct a command schedule which as used herein is a user program that establishes an action to be taken such as a change of state in at least one of the outlets logging an event and or issuing alerts or alarms. A command schedule may include one or more program operations that compels an action in response to user defined thresholds on measured electrical power parameters environmental state or simply to define a power up or power down sequence at outlets . Other possible command schedules may be created as the ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize upon review of this disclosure. The creation and use of command schedules is described in more detail below.

PCS may include a controller that coordinates operations between functional components thereof. For example controller may pass data and messages between components and make any cross component format translations as necessary. Additionally controller may perform numerical computations process interrupts implement timers format data for storage in storage unit retrieve data from storage unit on behalf of other functional components and perform other such system control functionality. The present invention is not limited to a particular implementation of controller such may be implemented by a wide array of suitable machine and or process control methodologies without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the present invention.

Controller may execute a debugger which may be used to identify various system problems including those that occur in a particular user programmed command schedule. Additionally debugger may be utilized to identify proper operation of hardware and or software of PCS . Debugger may be activated and deactivated by a user such as a technician in accordance with properly formatted command for such received by controller such as through a user terminal. Debugger may be implemented in a wide array of debugger technologies as will be recognized by the ordinarily skilled artisan upon review of this disclosure.

PCS may include a data logger to record anomaly events that occur during operation thereof. As used herein an anomaly event is a measured quantity in an electrical power parameter that exceeds the bounds established for the particular electrical power parameter being measured. Such characteristic qualities may include but not limited to input voltage level input current level output voltage level output current level power consumption temperature humidity etc. Such qualities are referred to herein as process variables the values of which at selected times are evaluated against respective criteria. The criteria on the process variables such as numerical bounds thereon may be established by hard coded mechanisms in PCS to for example protect sensitive connected equipment that would be impaired if such criteria were to be exceeded. Other bounds may be established by a user through for example a command schedule. The crossing of these bounds constitutes an anomaly event as used herein and data logger tracks such events and stores information regarding these events in a log file in storage unit . Periodically or upon command the log file may be retrieved from storage such as by controller and provided to interested parties through a communication channel controlled by communication module . It is to be understood that an anomaly event may compel performance of some action in addition to logging the event as will be described in more detail below. Additionally logger is not limited to logging only anomaly events other data may be tracked and logged by a data logger in accordance with the application in which the present invention is embodied.

Communication module provides mechanisms by which access to PCS may be obtained by an external device. Communication module may include transmitters receivers coders decoders modulators demodulators buffers and other such functional components to implement communications per one or more communications technologies and protocols. Such technologies and protocols may include wireless transmission and media access including radio frequency and optical transmission wired electromagnetic media access packet switched and circuit switched networks and corresponding data format and transmission protocols and so on. For purposes of description and not limitation communication module implements a serial communication interface Sx such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface and a network interface Nx such as an Ethernet interface. Through either interface Sx or Nx one or more corresponding communication channels can be constructed and communication may be carried out over the communication channel.

PCS may include a user interface controller to provide user controls by which a user can establish and modify PCS operation. The present invention is not limited to a particular user interface architecture although in certain embodiments the user interface affords flexible control over PCS operations at an arbitrary point of access. To that end the user controls may be stored in onboard memory such as storage unit and retrieved through a communication channel by an external device. Accordingly such an external device can operate PCS from anywhere provided that a communication channel can be constructed therewith by the device. Such an interface may be achieved by for example Hypertext Markup Language HTML coded pages of user controls that are retrieved by requests conveyed through Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP . When so embodied activation of a user control may be associated with a command that is also conveyed through HTTP.

In normal operation PCS may receive supply power through input terminals L N and G which may be filtered and conditioned by conditioner . The conditioned supply power may then be monitored through monitor which converts the power level through a measurement of voltage and or current into a representative signal indicative of the level. The representative signal may be provided to power controller and used thereby to make power control decisions against control parameters. Additionally the representative signal from monitor may be provided to data logger which may store the power levels in storage unit for various reports. Additionally power controller may receive representative signals from environmental sensors which may also be used to make power control decisions. Such decisions can be made based on power quality criteria that when met constitutes an anomaly event in accordance with which power controller may take a corresponding action. For example if the input voltage crosses a maximum safe voltage threshold level power controller may cause outlet controllers to transition into a nonconductive state thereby removing unsafe voltage levels from attached loads. As another example if an outlet controller indicates that the load attached to the corresponding outlet is consuming power beyond an established threshold outlet controller may transition into a nonconductive state and provide a signal to power controller indicative of such. In yet another example upon a determination of environmental temperature exceeding some threshold as measured by environmental sensors power controller may cycle the power at outlets i.e. remove power to certain loads for a predetermined cycle time subsequent to which other loads will have power removed while the previously powered down outlets will be powered up. Such cycling may continue per for example a user programmed command schedule for over temperature conditions until the environmental temperature falls to within established limits. In each of these cases the occurrence of the anomaly event will compel indication of such to data logger which may record the occurrence of the event the time of the occurrence the action taken and other data that may be useful to identify such anomalies as well as to identify possible causes thereof.

It is to be understood that not all anomaly events need compel a power control action certain control parameters may be set to indicate an anomaly event which need only be logged. For example a voltage threshold may be established by a user the crossing of which by the input voltage may be logged solely for diagnostic purposes. This voltage threshold may be set to a voltage level that is below an unsafe overvoltage level and or above an unsafe undervoltage level where power control action would normally be compelled. Thus during a diagnostic phase subsequent to for example chronic unsafe overvoltage events logged data indicating a trend towards the unsafe voltage levels by way of crossing the lower voltage threshold may be useful to the technician to locate power and or equipment problems.

The control parameters against which power controller makes control decisions may be established in a command schedule of either a system constant command schedule type and or a user programmed command schedule type. Creation of a user programmed command schedule may be achieved by accessing user interface controller through a communication channel constructed through communication module . User interface controller may form a user interface on a possibly remote end user device such as a computer a cell phone and the like on which user controls are provided to make changes to the control parameters and or process variable criteria. For example one user control may allow the user to modify the aforementioned unsafe overvoltage threshold from that in a default command schedule thereby creating a new command schedule. In another example user controls may be presented on the user interface by which a sequence of power related operations can be established and modified. The present invention is not limited to any set of control parameters command schedules and user controls by which such parameters and command schedules are established and modified. Many alternative configurations to those illustrated and described herein can be used in conjunction with the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

In there is illustrated an exemplary processing platform by which operation and control processes described with reference to PCS in can be carried out. Platform may include a processor such as a microprocessor or microcontroller a memory subsystem communicatively coupled to processor and an input output I O subsystem communicatively coupled to processor . Additionally platform may include one or more analog circuits by which controller inputs may be measured. For example analog circuits may include one or more power sensors that may be used to obtain signal representations of input power e.g. input voltage and or input current and signal representations of outlet power e.g. outlet voltage and or outlet load current. Such signal representations may be achieved by rectification of the supply AC voltage for example to a DC voltage and then converting the resulting DC voltage into a sequence of numerical samples indicative of the DC amplitude through the use of an analog to digital converter A D representatively illustrated at A D converter . Analog circuits may also include environmental sensors such as thermocouples digital thermometers humidity sensors accelerometers acoustic transducers and the like by which the environment within and surrounding PCS can be monitored. Such transducers produce an electrical signal indicative of the environmental variable for which they are adapted and the electrical signals may be converted into a sequence of numerical samples by another A D converter . The analog circuits produce values for process variables on which proper power control depends. Based on the values for the process variables the control of power is achieved through power control circuits which may include switches and relays and or semiconductor switch devices that distribute the received input power among outlets .

I O subsystem may be implemented in hardware and software to implement an interface between external systems and processor . Exemplary I O subsystem includes a network port such as an Ethernet port for communications with a communications network a serial port through which serial communications can be conducted and a general access port which may be used for connecting specialized equipment computer peripherals and the like. For example access port may be configured to provide signals to enunciators such as audible buzzers sirens and the like and indicators such as lamps light emitting diodes LEDs and the like as illustrated at component . Such enunciators and indicators may provide visual and audible notification of operations of PCS and of anomaly events detected thereby. The present invention is not limited to specific communication techniques and protocols and the ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize numerous such communication techniques that may be used in conjunction with the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

I O subsystem affords communications with a variety of external communication devices. For example a local interface device may implement a simple terminal through serial port by which among other things diagnostic operations can be performed. As another example an end user device may be communicatively coupled to platform through network port . Indeed end user device may be coupled to network port through a communication channel constructed in a wider network operating under the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP suite. End user device may include a user interface that includes a display and a set of Human Interface Devices HIDs . Additionally end user device may include a processor and storage by which a program may be executed to interact with platform through user interface process as will be described in more detail below.

Memory subsystem may be segmented into a code segment in which to store processor instructions and data segment in which to store variable data. Processor may be configured to execute the processor instructions stored in code segment to thereby carry out various processes implementing the processing control functionality of PCS . For example processor may execute system code to carry out system control process power control code to carry out power control process user interface code to carry out user interface process data logger code to carry out data logger process debugger code to carry out debugger process and communication code to carry out communication process .

System control process may implement the functionality of system controller in . System control process may in addition to those functions described above with regard to controller allocate memory allocate processor time coordinating time sharing among processes executing on processor and other such tasks as required to provide a stable data processing and control platform for purposes of power control. System control process may store the processor state during context switching and the like as well as other variable data in data segment as representatively illustrated at system data storage location . The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize numerous system control methodologies that may be used in conjunction with the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

Data logger process may implement the functionality of data logger in that is monitoring various inputs and system states that have been selected for logging formatting data indicative of characteristics of such inputs and system states in accordance with a predetermined data format and storing the formatted data in memory such as logged data in data memory segment .

Communication process cooperates with the communication ports in I O subsystem to implement the procedures required for carrying out communications over a communication channel via the corresponding port or . Communication process may for example perform data encoding and decoding buffer overflow control and the like. Buffers and network stacks may be allocated in data segment representatively illustrated at communication data .

In certain embodiments PCS may include a serial protocol by which terminal communications may be conducted with platform . Such a serial protocol may be a command response protocol whereby a command is issued through serial port and the result of the command is returned as a response. An example command list of an embodiment of a serial protocol is provided below in Table 1.

Access to debugger may be obtained through serial port . Debugger process may implement the functionality of the debugger by which processor states process states power control states and the like may be tracked and stored as debug data in data segment for system diagnostics. Through the serial protocol commands a debug level may be selected examples of which are given below in Table 2.

Once the debug level has been selected the features of debugger process may be enabled and or disabled using a setDebugFeature command. Example features are exemplified in Table 3 below.

The types of data that may be tracked by debugger process will vary with the application in which the invention is embodied. The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize various techniques and data by which a debugger may be implemented in the PCS .

Power control process may implement the functionality of power controller and outlet controllers in PCS . In there is illustrated an exemplary power control state machine and may be implemented by power control process . It is to be understood that state machine depicts a simplified configuration of a possibly much more complex power control system. The exemplary process illustrated in is provided for purposes of explanation of possible scenarios that may be encountered in an embodiment of the present invention. The ordinarily skilled artisan will appreciate other possible scenarios that may be implemented by way of the present invention upon review and understanding of this disclosure.

In an initial state PCS is initialized with initial values of control parameters that define the state transition boundaries of state machine . State machine then transitions into a Run state and remains in Run state as long as all process variables e.g. voltage current temperature humidity etc. are within operational bounds thereon established as Nominal for normal operation. State machine may transition out of Run state upon a process event or upon being compelled into a Terminal state upon occurrence of an Exit event which may occur upon ceasing control operations such as by removing system operating power from PCS . As used herein a process event occurs when a value of a process variable exceeds a state transition boundary defining the event. Process events may include ENTRY events Non critical Anomaly NCA events Critical Anomaly CA events Programmed PROG events and Completion events CMP . The transition boundaries defining these events may be appropriately established based on the severity of the consequences of crossing the boundary. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the foregoing events. Indeed embodiments of the invention that allow flexible programming of the state transition boundaries afford essentially unlimited number of events and corresponding states.

State machine may include a set of outlet state machines representatively illustrated at state machine comprising a conductive state and a non conductive state . Each outlet state machine is operable into one of states independently of the state or state transitions of other of the state machines . The outlet state machine remains in the state into which it was most recently transitioned while state machine is in Run state . Then depending on the process event that causes state machine to transition out of Run state one or more outlet state machines may receive a Compel Open CO event which compels outlet state machine into Non conductive state or a Compel Closed CC event which compels outlet state machine into Conductive state .

Upon an ENTRY event state machine may transition into Log state in which certain information such as the values of the process variables that triggered the ENTRY event the time of the event and so on are stored in log memory location by data logger process . Thus the state transition boundaries for an ENTRY event may be at essentially any level for any process variable. However to maximize the ratio of useful information to the amount of storage required for logging data the transition boundaries for an ENTRY event may be established at levels that may indicate potential problems in PCS operation power source quality and or in one or more loads connected to PCS . Once the pertinent data has been logged a CMP event occurs at which point state machine transitions into Run state .

An NCA event may occur upon detection of anomalies that require corrective action but do not rise to the level of imminent equipment damage or system failure. In response to an NCA event state machine may transition into Transition Necessary state at which one or more outlet state machines receive a CO event and transition into Non conductive state as necessary to counteract the anomaly. The number of outlet state machines and which outlet state machines are compelled into the Non conductive state depend on the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the NCA event. For example if the NCA event was caused by power consumption of one of the loads exceeding the transition boundary assigned thereto the outlet state machine controlling the outlet to which the offending load is connected may transition into the Non conductive state to the exclusion of any other of the outlet state machines . As another example if the NCA event is caused by environmental temperature exceeding the transition boundary established therefor certain of the outlet state machines may transition into Non conductive state in accordance with a predetermined power down scheme devised for reducing temperature. In certain cases outlet state machines may alternately cycle between Non conductive state and Conductive state in counter cycle with other outlet state machines . Once the conditions that caused the NCA event have been cleared a CMP event may occur whereby state machine is compelled back into Run state . The ordinarily skilled artisan will readily recognize other useful NCA events and power control schemes that can be used to counter act such events upon review of this disclosure.

In certain applications state transition boundaries on process variables may be established to trigger a CRIT event at which time immediate system wide action should be taken to prevent system failure or equipment damage. In such an event state machine may transition into Open All state which compels a CO event in all outlet state machines . Such a CRIT event may occur for example when an over voltage of sufficient magnitude threatens not only all loads but PCS as well. Once the offending process variables have returned to Nominal a CMP event may drive state machine into Run state . The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize other criticalities that can be anticipated by prudent selection of state transition boundaries on the appropriate process variables.

As discussed above arbitrary power control and system behavior of certain embodiments of the present invention may be achieved by constructing a command schedule. During execution of such a command schedule a PROG event may compel state machine into Transition Selected state . In Transition Selected state outlet state machines selected per the command schedule may be transitioned into either Conductive state or Non conductive state . Once the selected outlet state machines arrive at the selected state a CMP event may occur and state machine may transition into Run state . Certain command schedules may comprise a number of program steps the first step is executed upon entry into Transition Selected state in response to a PROG event. Upon the subsequent CMP event Run state is entered followed by a PROG event compelling the next step in the sequence. At each state in the sequence one or more CO and CC events may be compelled in outlet state machines . Accordingly numerous power up and power down procedures can be implemented. Command schedules may be created as will be described below and stored in a memory location in data segment .

It is to be understood that while the process states are described above with reference to changing outlet states other system functionality may be modified while state machine is in a state designed for such. Other control procedures may be implemented by embodiments of the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

Returning once again to user interface process may implement user interface controller . User interface process may provide remote access to memory location through I O . That is user control instructions in memory location may be retrieved by for example end user device through user interface process . The user control instructions may be stored in storage unit and executed by processor to generate a user control on UI . Through the generated user control various parameters may be established set and modified by manipulation thereof through HIDs . In certain embodiments operations of system control process user interface process and communication process may be coordinated to implement a Web server by which user control instructions are retrievable from memory through a properly formatted HTTP request. The user control instructions may include HTML compliant web pages having controls suitably embedded therein. Such embedded controls may be implemented by a suitable processor executable instruction set such as HTML form instructions Perl Java Javascript etc. Through the user controls in UI the end user device may alter power control data such as through another suitably formatted HTTP request. The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize other techniques by which a remote access device such as end user device may set power control data including by other application network protocols or dedicated communication sessions through a specialized interface.

In an exemplary web page is illustrated the instructions for rendering of which may be stored in memory location and retrieved therefrom through Web server . The instructions for Web page may be executed by processor to generate the graphical representation thereof illustrated in . Web page includes several graphically rendered controls that can be manipulated by a user through one or more HIDs . Among these controls are tab controls representatively illustrated at tab textual data entry controls representatively illustrated at for example textual data entry control drop down selection controls representatively illustrated at drop down selection control . The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize a wide variety of graphical user interface GUI controls that can be used in conjunction with the present invention and the present invention is not limited to any particular data entry or data presentation technique.

Through tab controls a user may select an interface into various functions implemented by PCS . In the illustrated example of such functionality is partitioned into groups a device interface illustrated as interface an outlets interface illustrated in as interface a programming interface illustrated in as interface an email interface illustrated in as interface and a log interface illustrated in as interface . It is to be understood that the interfaces are but a few examples of a wide variety of interface controls and groupings of such controls that can be implemented in conjunction with the present invention without deviating from the spirit and intended scope thereof. The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize other interfaces and controls that augment those described and illustrated upon appreciation of the adaptability of the present invention as disclosed herein.

Exemplary device interface includes a data entry field by which PCS as a unit may be assigned a descriptive name. In data entry field an Internet Protocol IP address may be provided for Web server . In certain embodiments the IP address of Web server may be assigned by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP and in other embodiments the IP address may be assigned a static value. In data entry field a Telnet port may be identified through which console communications may be carried out with PCS . In data entry fields and a user name and password may be provided such that access to Web server is denied without these proper credentials. In certain embodiments multiple authorized users may be identified each with a unique username and password. In such embodiments a separate interface may be created through which such user information can be entered. In data entry fields and console serial communications may be configured such as for local interface . The console interface may be used for both debugging and command line operations of PCS where the command line interface implements functionality similar to that described herein with reference to Web page interfaces.

Web page implements the outlet interface by which control parameters may be established for individual outlets through for example outlet controllers . The control for each outlet may be selected by for example a selection control and for the selected outlet as illustrated by the outlet selection of outlet various data entry controls may be presented. For example data entry fields may provide means by which bounds on an amount of load current flowing through the selected outlet are established outside of which an alarm may be issued. Similarly data entry fields may provide means by which bounds on a voltage at the selected outlet are established outside of which an alarm may be issued. In data entry field an amount of load current may be entered above which power is disconnected from the specified outlet and thus from connected load equipment. In data entry fields bounds on the outlet voltage may be set outside of which power is disconnected from the specified outlet and thus from connected load equipment. It should be appreciated that the data entered in fields and may be used to establish transition boundaries in state machine or outlet state machines .

In certain embodiments the processes of PCS illustrated and described with reference to may be accessible through an API through which specific single and multi step operations may be programmed. For example programmed operation of PCS may include steps that among others get or set selected outlet states obtain measured values for process variables e.g. voltage current power temperature etc. power cycle one or more outlets and so on. Certain embodiments further allow conditional logic to be constructed within a command schedule created through PCS programming. When so embodied a user can construct special purpose command schedules that can be executed upon user demand or as a part of a response to some predetermined condition. For example circumstances of an application may require that equipment be powered down or up in a prescribed manner such as when one piece of equipment connected to PCS relies on the state of another piece of equipment connected thereto for proper shutdown. The present invention is not limited to particular API functionality which may extend beyond that provided as examples below.

Web page implements an exemplary programming interface by which various single and multistep operations may be programmed. In the illustrated example panel displays the steps that have been programmed as well as the step that is currently being programmed. A programmer may add a step through user control delete a step through user control or clear an entire command schedule through user control . Once a command schedule has been completed it can be saved by activation of a suitable file save control representatively illustrated at save control . A previously programmed command schedule may be retrieved by activation of a suitable file system access control representatively illustrated at file access control . Once retrieved the steps in a command schedule may be modified added to and deleted via the programming controls such as through the exemplary operations described in the paragraphs that follow. Programmed command schedules may be stored in memory location in individual ones thereof may be retrieved and executed by power control process via a suitable file retrieval control such as file retrieval control .

With each step a set of programming controls may be presented through which the API functionality implemented thereby can be accessed to establish the step. In certain embodiments a set of outlet controls may be presented by which the separate outlets can be independently controlled in each step. For example outlet controls may include a connectivity state control by which the load connectivity at the corresponding outlet can be modified a selection control by which the corresponding outlet can be selected for programming in the current program step and conditional logic controls by which the state of the corresponding outlet is affected by an action entered in THEN field based on the evaluation results of a statement entered in the IF field . Connectivity state control may be embodied so that the connectivity state of the previous step is initially indicated. To change the connectivity state in the current step a user may activate selection control to indicate that the selected outlet is affected by operations of the current step and the connectivity state control may be toggled such as by suitably activating the control into the new state. Once all operations that are to occur during the current step have been established through programming controls the programmer may activate Apply control whereby the step is established in the command schedule. The programmer may continue adding steps as necessary to complete the desired programmed functionality.

In certain embodiments conditional logic may be programmed into one or more steps of a particular command schedule. As illustrated in the example of the conditional logic may be implemented by IF THEN statements through conditional logic controls where IF field contains a binary statement and THEN field contains an action that can be executed by PCS . In certain embodiments the IF and THEN controls are implemented through drop down selection controls in which all possible entries for each field are displayed in a manner by which the programmer can select the appropriate entry. The present invention is not limited to the form and extent of the conditional logic certain embodiments may allow only simple expressions in IF field whereas other embodiments may allow complex nested logic therein. As one example a programmer may enter the expression IF kW 1.5 THEN Alarm whereby the power drawn by the load connected to the corresponding outlet selected by outlet selection control would be measured and an alarm would be issued if the power is greater than 1.5 kW. The foregoing example assumes that the label kW identifies the process variable corresponding to outlet power. As another example the programmer may enter IF Temp 32 AND Curr 15 THEN Off AND Alarm in which case both the ambient temperature assuming Temp is the label for such must be greater than 32 C. and the current through the selected outlet assuming Curr is the label for such must be greater than 15 A in order for the expression to evaluate to TRUE. Upon such positive determination the selected outlet is transitioned to the Off state assuming Off is the label for such action and an alarm is issued. The number and format of the labels for process variables accessible for the conditional logic and the labels for the available actions for the conditional logic will vary with the application for which the present invention is embodied. The present invention is not limited by such implementation details.

As illustrated in an inter step delay may be introduced through user control . When a value is entered into the Step Delay data entry field a delay equal to the amount of time entered must lapse before the following step will be executed. Other such inter step functions may be implemented with the present invention without departing from the spirit and intended scope thereof.

Web page implements an exemplary email interface by which interested parties can be informed as to the status of PCS . Email interface may include a plurality of data entry controls by which recipient email addresses may be entered. In certain embodiments each email address is associated with a content level control by which the type of messages sent to the recipient is selected. For example one recipient may wish to receive all content which may vary by application but may include alarms log entry events timed events unexpected operations etc. On the other hand another recipient may wish to be notified only if critical events occur such as when the system has shut down to remove power from all connected loads. The present invention is not limited to granularity of content control or to a particular email message format. The message need only convey enough information so that the recipient can identify the condition for which the email was sent.

Web page implements an exemplary log interface by which logged data may be reviewed. Log interface may include an event selection control by which a time and date of a logged event may be selected as illustrated at selected event . Upon selection of the time and date panel may then display data pertinent to the particular event. In the illustrated example of a sequence of events occurred at 11 32 PM EST on Mar. 30 2012. First a power consumption threshold was crossed at outlet as indicated at event field . Also the temperature in and or around PCS was over a threshold value as indicated at event field . Outlet was then cycled off as indicated at event field . Each event field may contain pertinent data such as measured and threshold values of process variables at the time the data were logged. The present invention is not limited to the content or format of data logs entries may be made on system or programmed events or be made on a periodic basis regardless of the system state.

In operation it is determined whether the established connection is through serial port . If so operation determines whether a debug session has been initiated such as through a command line command. If so the debug session is afforded in operation . If the serial connection is not for a debug session as determined in operation a serial session is afforded whereby for example the API of PCS is accessed via a command line interface.

If in operation it is determined that the connection is other than a serial port connection it is determined in operation whether the Web server is being accessed by an HTTP request. If not process may proceed to operation whereby a session of some other network transfer protocol is afforded such as a Telnet session. If on the other hand the Web server is being accessed it may be determined in operation whether a request for the program interface page has been received. If not process may transition to operation whereby a user control session may be afforded through HTTP in operation . In such a user control session various Web pages such as those discussed above may be retrieved and various system functions may be initiated modified terminated etc. thereby. In one such operation a command schedule may be executed such as by the command schedule execution controls described above.

If it is determined in operation that the programming page has been retrieved process may transition to operation in whereby it is determined whether a new command schedule is being programmed. If not a previously programmed command schedule may be retrieved in operation . In operation it is determined whether a new step is being added to the command schedule. If not a previous step may be selected in operation such as through step selection control . In operations various API functions may be selected and added to the step as discussed above. It may then be determined in operation whether the step has been fully configured such as by detection of the activation of Apply control . If no the programming may continue at operation where it is determined whether a new step is desired.

Returning to it may be determined in operation whether the session established in operation is to be terminated. If so the connection may be terminated in accordance with the specifications of the corresponding connection. The connection will continue to be in effect as illustrated in operation as long as the session is not terminated.

Having described preferred embodiments of new and improved power conditioning management techniques it is believed that other modifications variations and changes will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings set forth herein. It is therefore to be understood that all such variations modifications and changes are believed to fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
