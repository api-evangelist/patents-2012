This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 533 600 filed on Sep. 12 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to remote care and monitoring and more particularly to a system and method for remote care and monitoring of the user of a mobile device such as a smartphone and for simplifying use of the mobile device by the user.

This invention provides a unique software solution and method for facilitating the use of a mobile smartphone device while also enabling authorized users e.g. care providers concerned family members to remotely interact with the mobile user provide them medical care information daily care instruction alerts and reminders general assistance immediately connect to the mobile user s phone without them answering provide the authorized users remote mobile phone control and tracking functions as well as remotely updating and maintaining the mobile user s mobile device.

Mobile phones historically developed for use by elderly children or special needs groups have consisted of traditional push button cell phones modified in certain ways via some combination of a simplified digital menu amplified speaker enlarged and or paired down buttons and sometimes the addition of an urgent call and or specialized operator button. The use of GPS or other locating device technologies has also been incorporated into some of these traditional phones for informational or emergency location purposes.

These traditional mobile phones however have not had the capabilities to facilitate a higher level of interaction between a mobile user and their care provider s . While some have had features for remotely updating contact information sending text messages or having an operator assist with dialing there are many features and capabilities that these telephones do not have. For example these traditional mobile phones do not have the following capabilities 

The introduction of smartphones mobile phones offering PC like capabilities with technologies such as contextually changing touch screens email Internet browsing Wi Fi GPS an accelerometer a magnetometer compass a graphical user interface operating system a camera and the capability to run a variety of software applications offer this potential. However smartphones are generally feature heavy and complicated to use even with the most basic configurations. While these smartphones may have some of the technology capabilities mentioned available such as software that provides location alerts or determines phone location or the capabilities to provide the features mentioned above the complexity and general feature rich design of the smartphone has made it difficult for elderly young children or people with special needs to adopt.

What is needed therefore is a system and method that can provide the aforementioned functionality through smartphone technology. The present invention satisfies this need.

The present invention comprises a system and method for remote care and monitoring of the user of a mobile device such as a smartphone and for simplifying use of the mobile device by the user. As used herein a smartphone or mobile device should be construed to include a smartphone sometimes referred to herein as a mobile phone or a primary mobile phone or device a mobile tablet and other similar portable computing devices which are able to communicate electronically through means of cellular wireless and or radio communication for which the invention could be deployed.

In the disclosed embodiment the system and method of the present invention comprises several components including software operable on the mobile device and or a remote device such as another smartphone a computer including for example a web based application system or other device sometimes referred to herein as a secondary device . More specifically the present invention comprises 

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description in conjunction with the appended claims.

The benefits and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.

It should be further understood that the title of this section of this specification does not imply nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.

In a disclosed embodiment the system and method of the present invention comprises the individual and aggregated feature set and or subsets of the capabilities and features described in the instant application for use in connecting primary users and authorized remote parties e.g. caregivers with one another for urgent and non urgent situations.

The feature set includes but is not limited to audio and or video direct connect automated remote connectivity automated call conferencing based on predetermined phone numbers location tracking automated picture and or video sending remote camera monitoring automated location tracking with photo and or video logging intelligent monitoring of urgent and non urgent situations including but not limited to lack of movement with the primary mobile phone lack of reaching a location by the primary mobile phone automated fall detection automated wellness checks custom actionable surveys as well as remotely updating and customizing the primary mobile phone application it will be appreciated that reference numeral refers to the primary mobile phone with software installed thereon sometimes referred to herein as the application for causing the primary mobile phone to operate in accordance with the principles of the system and method of the present invention in from a secure Internet application and or secondary mobile applications and a specialized user interface that compels the primary application user to utilize their phone though it is not required to make use of the application features described herein.

The system and method of the present invention is designed in part to interact with some of the innate programmed features of the mobile phone but mask the phone s standard user interface and navigation so that those innate features such as the dialer the user phone book the web browser the camera battery indicator and menu options are accessible to the user in a simplified easier to use interface presented to the primary mobile application user. Developing an interface that overlays an existing interface is a well documented process and is known to those skilled in the art. It is accomplished through basic level application programming interface API and or other coding utilized by the manufacturer and or operating system provider of the smartphone to connect and interact with the phone s hardware and operating system features.

The application interface is built through a series of screens that contain a combination of buttons text information graphics and or interactive objects that are part of the interface API functions of a smartphone. Examples of interactive objects include virtual graphic buttons physical buttons that are part of the phone itself text boxes selection lists radio buttons check boxes and other objects as are known to those skilled in the art. Interactive objects leverage user feedback in order to take action and are generally part of the smartphone s operating system API. The inclusion of the interface as a part of the instant invention is necessary not for the novelty of creating an interface but for the novelty of the interface itself and also for the novelty in how the interface is being applied to the utilization of the various embodiments of the invention described herein.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the system and method of the instant invention may be adapted to operate with any number of mobile device operating systems including without limitation iOS Android etc. mobile devices including without limitation iPhones iPads etc. and desktop operating systems Mac OS Windows etc. . All such mobile operating systems devices and desktop operating systems are included with the scope of the instant disclosure.

As seen in the system and method of the present invention provides a simplified mobile device interface. The exemplary interfaces illustrate simplified mobile device navigation and provide 

The details for the novel implementation of the collection of these features are further discussed in the instant application. For those comfortable with navigating a modern smartphone the interface of the primary smartphone application can be customized to hide and or to turn on and off other applications phone features and buttons such as the search button home button or the camera or web browser . The software of the system and method of the present invention can run in the background to provide the powerful caregiving connectivity features that assist with both resolving urgent situations and enhancing daily interactions even if the simplified interface is turned off.

If the interface is turned on it helps facilitate the navigation and use of the monitoring and caregiving features described herein through direct access to many of those features and the configuration of those features. Furthermore many of those would be primary mobile application users are not able and or willing to use the smartphone in its native form because of any combination of issues such as over complexity of the phone including features and functions that are foreign and wouldn t be utilized by the user small or difficult to read fonts and font size lack of enough contrast among graphics and text that make it difficult to see and or read difficulty configuring the phone with the functions desired difficulty navigating the phone because of concepts and features not found in traditional phones etc.

With the primary mobile application interface many of these users would now be able to successfully use a smartphone to make calls and then leverage the smartphone to interact with loved ones and caregivers because the interface provides an easy intuitive way for them to use a smartphone and a direct easy and intuitive way to perform the many helpful caregiving functions of the primary mobile application described in this document. If enabled the primary mobile application interface will run as soon as the smartphone itself is booted up as part of the start sequence in order to mask other smart phone functions via the interface.

The primary mobile application functions by resting in a home state and then being triggered to change states based on a variety of internal and or external triggers. The application then takes action in those different states sometimes switching among the states until completing the series of tasks and returning to the home state configuration.

The home state is the default starting point for the system. In the home state the application displays a simplified interface for the user to interact with the primary smartphone unless the user has turned off the interface as described above. If the interface is disabled the user interacts with the mobile phone operating system regularly while the primary application core activities run in the background. The smartphone s operating system API allows users to create activities processes and have them run in the background. Either way interface enabled or disabled in the home state some core activities run in the background idle until they are triggered. Examples include a logging b fall detection c idleness checks d wellness safety checks e other monitoring and notification functions and f direct connect receiver that are described herein.

These background activities of the primary mobile application system each described briefly below and then in further detail later in the instant application may or may not prompt user interaction at different points. When invoked these background activities may change the state of the phone to require an interaction either from the primary mobile user or remotely from an authorized remote user .

The states displayed in and shown below illustrate a sampling of changes from the home state that may prompt a user interaction 

The purpose of a direct connection is to allow an authorized remote user the ability to see hear and interact with the primary mobile application user at the authorized remote user s discretion and to connect with the primary application user which may be a care recipient for primarily concerning urgent or potentially urgent situations. The authorized remote user might also leverage the information gathered through the monitoring processes and logged from the primary smartphone application in order to help illustrate what may have transpired recently with the primary mobile application user .

In just one example of a direct connection in accordance with the principles of the system and method of the instant invention the primary mobile application user responds negatively to a wellness check survey from the primary mobile application perhaps indicating they aren t feeling well. The primary mobile application recognizes the input response as a negative response because response options are pre configured in the primary mobile application as positive negative or neutral. The application may respond to the primary application user with a follow up question based on the logic tree of the wellness check or perhaps it may recommend calling a doctor or 911. The primary user may choose to take action or may choose not to call or take action.

Regardless the primary mobile application may send an electronic notification email SMS and or securely through the web portal application and or the secondary mobile application to inform the remote authorized user s of wellness check outcome and subsequent activities of the primary mobile application and primary mobile phone including but not limited to any calls made date time stamped history of location s to which the phone traveled tagged with or without pictures and or video taken at those periodic intervals throughout the day and or any relevant urgent or non urgent producing notifications. The remote authorized user may then have called the primary application user with no response. The remote authorized user having special permission in the primary mobile application configuration may then initiate a direct connect to turn on the primary authorized user s phone to try and interact with them to make sure they are alright and taking the appropriate actions.

As shown in the steps for a direct connection in one embodiment of the system and method of the present invention comprise 

A remote authorized user presses a button to initiate a direct connection from either a web application or a secondary mobile phone application . As shown in Urgent Connect Now on the web application and Direct Connect on the secondary mobile application are exemplary buttons. In one embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the option to press the button is available only to pre authorized users whose electronic profile has been specially flagged in the primary application system data store stored on a suitable computer system and or communicated to the primary smartphone application data store during either the application setup or configuration processes and stored in the configuration data that is shared among the primary application system the primary smartphone and the web portal application and secondary mobile phone application as being allowed to initiate a direct connection.

If the direct connection was initiated through a web portal application interface the system and method of the present invention will initiate an Internet based Voice Over IP VOIP call cellular call and or hybrid VOIP cellular call to the primary mobile smartphone through the primary application system or another method. If the smartphone has video conference capabilities then the web portal application via the primary application system will initiate a video conference call instead. The primary system application will recognize video conference capabilities through configured settings in the primary application system data store that maintain status of whether the primary smartphone has the hardware and software capability for video conferencing. In one embodiment of the invention such information is linked and stored during the setup and or configuration process and stored in the configuration data that is shared among the primary application system the primary smartphone and the web portal application and secondary mobile phone application .

If the direct connect was initiated through a secondary mobile phone the system and method of the present invention will directly call the primary mobile phone through a cellular network VOIP and or hybrid VOIP cellular call or indirectly call the primary mobile phone via the primary application system using cellular network VOIP and or hybrid VOIP cellular call. If the system and method of the present invention both the primary smartphone and the secondary mobile phone have video conference capabilities then the secondary mobile or smartphone application will initiate a video conference call instead that may go directly to the primary mobile phone or indirectly through the primary application system . The primary smartphone application and or the primary application system will recognize video conference capabilities through configured settings in the primary application system data store that maintain status of whether the primary smartphone has the hardware and software capability for video conferencing.

In parallel the clicking of the direct connect button in web portal application and secondary mobile application will also notify the primary application system that a direct connect call is being placed as well as set specialized flags in the primary application system and or the secondary mobile application system that a direct connect call is being requested.

The web portal application and or the secondary mobile phone application of the system and method of the present invention will electronically notify the primary application system that a direct connection call is being requested as well as set specialized flags in the primary application system and or the secondary mobile application system that a direct connect call is being requested.

The primary mobile smartphone application will recognize the caller or the source of the call audio and or video call as it is pre configured with authorized user identifiable information and or secondary mobile phone identifiable information. The primary mobile smartphone application will pick up any combination of the source phone number source IP address and or other user identifiable information associated with the person initiating the direct connection as obtained by logging into the web portal application and or the secondary mobile application . There are two primary options based on this alternative 

Option The primary mobile smartphone application recognizes the source as having permission to direct connect and automatically causes the primary smartphone itself to connect pick up the direct call and or video conference call if video conferencing is available and enabled . If video conferencing is not enabled then the primary mobile phone may enable it and then connect or respond video conference dial to the initiating web portal and or secondary mobile phone application .

Option The primary mobile smartphone makes an electronic authorization and validation request of the primary application system to ensure 

B. To validate that the requesting source is not only authorized but actually requesting a direct connection as opposed to simply requesting a regular call video conference connection .

Upon authorizing and validating the primary mobile smartphone application causes the primary smartphone to pick up the call or call back the source through cellular VOIP and or hybrid cellular VOIP means. If video conferencing is not enabled then the primary mobile phone may enable it and then connect or respond with video conference dial to the initiating web portal and or secondary mobile phone application .

The primary application system will electronically notify the primary mobile smartphone that an authorized direct connection is being requested via a web based Internet application data transfer text message email or other electronic means .

At that point the primary smartphone application will automatically call the requesting web portal user and or secondary mobile phone user through cellular VOIP and or hybrid cellular VOIP means. If video conferencing is requested then if it is not enabled then the primary mobile phone may enable it and then connect or respond with video conference dial to the initiating web portal and or secondary mobile phone application . The web portal application as linked with the primary application system and or the secondary mobile phone application will have had a flag set to automatically pick up call from the primary smartphone and or the primary application system from Step .

In both alternatives the primary mobile smartphone application will with reference to turn on the speakerphone s microphone turn up the volume identify primary smartphone location turning on location identification features if they are disabled turn on camera and snap pictures not snapping pictures if video conferencing is selected via the phone s API group link the information together and send it to the primary application server via the notification system .

Alternative Option Primary smartphone application automatically picks up phone call. For video conference viewing primary smartphone application enables camera module and automatically connects via video conference.

Alternative Option Secondary mobile application and or web portal interface automatically picks up phone call. For video conference viewing primary smartphone application automatically connects via video conference. An indicator flag in the secondary mobile application and or web portal interface informs the respective application to automatically pickup connect.

Alternative Secondary mobile application and or web portal interface automatically picks up phone call. For video conference viewing primary smartphone application automatically connects via video conference. An indicator flag in the secondary mobile application and or web portal interface informs the respective application to automatically pickup connect.

In all three paths the primary application system will package up all the information gathered and sent from the primary smartphone in Step and make it available to authorized users for viewing via the web portal interface and or the secondary mobile application . The information can be viewed simultaneously before and or after the call and or video call is made.

In all three paths the primary smartphone application may also cause a loud ring and or automated voice to inform user that a direct connect is underway and also may cause the primary smartphone to visually cue the user through changes in color text vibration and or possibly other cues.

For example the direct connection request has been received by the primary mobile application perhaps through SMS or email electronic communication. The request may have come directly from the remote authorized user s phone via the secondary mobile application or through the primary application system via the secondary mobile application or from the web portal application interface . The monitoring process of the primary mobile application recognizes the direct connection request and triggers the intelligent event identification engine to collect phone data around whether the primary phone can connect to the Internet and if the connection is strong and fast enough.

If not able to connect or if connection is not sufficient the monitoring process would trigger the mobile application to look up the phone number of the authorized remote caregiver in the primary application data storage database and initiate an audio cellular call back to that phone number. In one instance the requestor application i.e. the secondary mobile application and or the web portal application having flagged itself as attempting to direct connect to a particular phone in its own configuration would identify the incoming phone number as belonging to the primary mobile application recognizing it as pre authorized automatically answer the call. In another example the phone could ring until the remote authorized user picked up the auto returned phone call.

In a separate example of a direct connection with an audio cellular call back as described above instead of dialing the initiating remote authorized caregiver s phone the primary mobile application may dial a bridge number into the primary application system which may then bridge dial the remote authorized user s phone through telephonic bridging PBX private branch exchange conferencing technology. Alternatively the remote authorized user s phone may already have dialed into the primary application system s PBX conferencing technology and be conferenced with the primary mobile phone .

In a different example the primary application may recognize Internet access as existent and sufficient however the initiating secondary mobile application may detect lack of Internet connectivity or sufficient Internet bandwidth speed. In such an instance the secondary mobile application may initiate a cellular audio only direct connect to the primary mobile application with a special flag indicating that an Internet connection will not suffice. The primary mobile application will interpret the flag and not attempt an Internet video and or VOIP connection but only an audio cellular direct connection as previously described.

In another example Internet connectivity from both the initiating phone or web application as well as from the primary mobile application is existent and sufficient. In this case a call back is initiated by the primary mobile application via its VOIP voice over IP client that connects to a VOIP server as part of the primary application system . The VOIP server also connects to the secondary mobile application and or the web application in advance of notifying the primary mobile application or after notifying or after the primary mobile application has a VOIP connection with the VOIP server. The VOIP server therefore bridges creates the connection then between the primary mobile application and the initiating secondary mobile application and or web application interface .

As described a direct connect call results in creating a live phone call and or live video conference without the user of the primary mobile phone taking action. As shown in the type of call possible will depend on the quality of connection if the cellular internet connectivity is fast enough to support video calling that would take preference over or audio calling. In that case as a backup the system and method of the present invention uses a cellular audio call.

Internet existence and sufficiency is determined through API calls checking signal existence and strength of cellular Internet networks and wireless network detections. Pinging certain websites and or servers using internet protocol calls and timing and comparing response rates is another method that may be used. Such checks are performed on both sides of the connection the secondary mobile application or web application and the primary mobile application . Notifications are sent among systems using electronic communication usually some any combination of SMS texting email and or Internet protocol though also possibly via modem or other electronic communication methods that basic operating systems and possibly their APIs interact with. Audio calls and call answering are triggered through the device s APIs. VOIP video conference connections may be established over Internet protocol through interfacing with VOIP clients and server APIs.

The purpose of the information made available is to provide a broad and deep picture of what has been and is going on with the primary mobile phone application and the primary mobile user and to also help manage the daily caregiving features urgent connectivity features interface features and general phone features of the primary mobile application and primary mobile phone . The information can help determine the primary user s whereabouts their well being status in part through status of status and or wellness checks indicate whether any alarming incidents occurred such as dialing 911 and or a fall detection and related details indicate whether they have been following certain patterns of behavior and indicating whether the phone and the user have not moved for a period of time and or that the phone and the user did not reach an intended destination.

The information can also indicate whether the user has indicated that they have been taking medication whether the user confirmed certain alarm reminders whether the user has been making phone calls and to when and to whom they have been calling whether or not the user have been sending and or receiving messages and or whether the phone battery died or the phone is not in signal range cellular and or internet cellular and or Wi Fi .

The information may also prompt the remote authorized user to take action s which may include among the many actions described in the present invention editing altering adding or removing reminders including medication reminders such as taking refilling and or renewing medication updating medical profile information editing altering adding or removing particular automated wellness checks setting location reminders sending messages or information updating or changing the primary mobile application user interface updating numbers for auto conferencing on the primary mobile application updating caregiver notification settings and so on.

This sample information also illustrated in is provided and accessible to the user e.g. caregiver or authorized user who may be initiating a direct connect call on either the web portal application and the secondary mobile application and also to the primary smartphone user on the web portal application and the primary mobile application . The method and process of the invention calls for any and all of the information illustrated in to be available. The sample information should not be construed as exhaustively conveying all possible relevant information being made available and those skilled in the art will recognize that other types of information may be shared without departing for the scope of the instant disclosure.

In further detail the sample information may include in one embodiment of the system and method of the present invention with reference to 

a. The current and historical location and movement history as determined through GPS wireless and or cellular location determination systems and accelerometer logged with primary phone date and time from internal clock as periodically checked through the monitoring processes and configured through the configuration processes of the primary smartphone application . Additionally location and movement history may have photo and or video snippets tagged from the camera module being engaged periodically by the monitoring processes and configuration processes that can be viewed. Location and movement history may be displayed in a textual format and or via one or more markings or images of locations overlaid upon one or more map images. Furthermore clicking on a particular location via a map or link or inputting a particular location into input fields on the primary web interface and or secondary mobile application can search the historical logs database for other instances of the primary mobile application recording being at or around within a predetermined distance radius that location and return a listing of those instances with date times duration and potential pictures and or videos that may have been tagged and logged. The process flow for the logging process itself for most types of logging is shown and described in .

b. The phone call history log of inbound outbound missed and connected calls may also be available for view. Those calls that were auto third party conferenced via the primary mobile application may also be specially marked. Furthermore clicking on a particular phone number or inputting a particular phone number into input field s on the primary web interface and or secondary mobile application can search the historical logs database for other instances of the primary mobile application and or phone recording making those phone calls and return a listing of those instances with date times duration and potential location information that may have been tagged and logged. The logging process flow for most types of logging is shown and described in .

c. The current and historical phone status of the primary smartphone application may also be available. The basic logging process is shown and described in . The FEATURES logged may include current and historical information on the primary smartphone s battery life charging history when the phone s signal status has been strong weak or non existent availability of 3G and or 4G networks location date time stamping as well as the current status of key phone features which includes enabled or disabled status of camera module microphone speakerphones GPS accelerometer wireless radio LAN cellular system Bluetooth radio touch screen internal clock and other relevant phone features .

The user may be able to enable or disable any of these phone features remotely through the web portal application and or the secondary mobile application . Doing so consists of changes to the configuration files that get pushed to the primary smartphone from the secondary mobile application and or the web portal application and pushed through directly or via the primary application system .

d. A history of the outcome status of status and or wellness check ins as well as a log of the status and wellness check ins including the questions user responses and phone actions and corresponding notifications may also be available for view. Status and wellness checks are performed via the process shown and described in . As well the information and status around any fall detection phone shaking and or 911 calls by the primary smartphone application may be made available.

e. Urgent notifications. In the case of a fall shaking the primary smartphone fall detection process would be triggered. The process indicating how this is done is shown and described in . For example if the phone fell or was shaken the phone would recognize this event and trigger a check to see if the user has indeed fallen. The user can indicate to the primary smartphone application that they were alright causing the alert to be dropped but the event would still be logged in the system. In a different scenario if the phone fell or was shaken and the user did not respond or did respond but responded negatively that response information as well as the details around the phone calls and or notification s initiated by the primary smartphone application would also be made available.

f. A history of alerts and reminders for the primary smartphone user as well as medication reminders the primary smartphone user s responses and any notification s and or subsequent action s that the primary smartphone application may have taken based on user responses may also be available.

g. The primary smartphone application s medical profile and history of changes to the medical profile as well as any medication reminder history and changes may be made available.

h. The current configuration of the primary smartphone application which includes settings around the user interface settings for urgent connectivity and monitoring as well as settings for non urgent daily interactions may also be available for viewing and altering. Any changes made on the web portal application and or secondary mobile application are saved as configuration file changes and pushed out to the primary mobile application to incorporate the new configuration changes either directly or through the primary application system .

A novel portion of the system and method of the present invention are the monitoring processes that look listen for and act on a series of triggers including but not limited to primary phone application usage remote authorized user interactions and location based and other situational triggers including potentially urgent situations. These triggers in combination with the monitoring processes allow for the unique and high level of caregiving interactivity described. Below is further detail around the monitoring processes.

The monitoring processes digests the data collected from the various described phone features and other relevant phone features . This data collected includes current and historical status of the various monitoring processes as they are configured . An intelligent event identification engine IEIE looks for pattern matches against predetermined scenarios and rules set in the configuration and monitoring processes engines. The IEIE may be setup to utilize various rules and analysis to help in capturing events.

For example the IEIE can compare a series of readings collected from the location sensor to identify locations visited in the day. In another example the IEIE can evaluate data from accelerometers to identify movement e.g. is the user moving . That information is then processed for appropriate event notification based on notification configuration . The intelligent inferences themselves as well as the notification events that occurred based on the inferences may be made available.

The intelligent inferences themselves may also be used as triggers to create notification or other events including initiate a direct connection to authorized remote users or other relevant parties including 911 or urgent call centers and or to trigger some other monitoring process logging event and or trigger some other action within the primary smartphone application primary application system the web portal application and or the secondary mobile application .

Included here are a series of disclosed embodiments of the invention that utilize the specialized monitoring processes and the intelligent event identification engine . These embodiments are not exhaustive but are a sampling of the kind of unique capabilities of the system and methods described here.

In the disclosed embodiment of the invention the primary phone hasn t moved for several hours during the day this is called an idleness situation. The monitoring process records movement at several intervals and compares each as shown and described in . The idle behavior is identified by comparing the location of the primary smartphone with previous location readings. Location readings are taken according to a polling frequency for collecting location data here PFREQ and stores those location readings in a log via the process identified in . If the location has been the same or within a proximate distance defined as within LOCATION RANGE and a time period equal or greater than that defined in TGT PERIOD has elapsed the system identifies this as an idle situation. Otherwise if distance is not within the LOCATION RANGE the phone is considered to have moved and the process is reset for the next PFREQ. If the distance is within the LOCATION RANGE but the TGT PERIOD has not been reached the monitoring process will wait for further data points.

Once an idle situation is determined the information is logged as an idle event in the primary mobile application system. The information is logged in the system log potentially transmitted as an event notification to the primary application system and an idle status check is initiated. The idle check is an interactive messaging to the user and may involve validating with the user their status asking if they are alright indicating that the phone hasn t moved in TGT PERIOD and creating notifications for the appropriate recipients. If the user indicates they are ok and or have moved in the TGT PERIOD the system goes back to waiting for the next reading according to PFREQ. If the user does not indicate that they are alright or indicates a negative response then the system may perform other notification events to authorized users and or 911 based on the primary smartphone application s configuration.

In this example the monitoring process recognizes that both location and phone position haven t moved. It also may recognize that there has not been user activity on the phone in the form of moving or carrying the phone making phone calls or navigating in the phone in any way. Other data points may also be considered into the idleness assessment.

For example the monitoring process also may recognize that on that particular day or date during that particular time period the phone is normally at or near a different location perhaps at a particular address . This is done by the IEIE through a comparison of historical data dates times and locations and looking for patterns in movement to the same locations and deviations from those patterns. It may also recognize that an authorized remote user e.g. caregiver has specified that if the phone doesn t move during that period of time then to notify specified contacts registered in the configuration and in the primary smartphone application . Examples of contacts authorized remote users include but are not limited too that remote user other remote users family friends professional caregivers medical providers medical centers specialized living facilities and or urgent call centers.

The intelligent event identification engine recognizes these patterns and makes inferences that lead to notification of specified contacts and or a wellness status check in direct connection and or other action of the primary smartphone application to the primary smartphone application user . The responses of that user are processed and may lead to a notification of specified contacts logging to be made available for further monitoring processes to leverage the intelligent event identification engine direct connection and or other actions specified in the primary smartphone application .

In the disclosed embodiment of the invention the primary smartphone application monitoring processes recognizes that the phone hasn t reached a destination that it regularly does during that date day and or time period or a location that was specified by an authorized remote user in the configuration . The monitoring processes may also record lack of movement and or other indicators that a problem may exist. The intelligent event identification engine will identify pattern matches of problems and or look for specific problems and take appropriate actions and notifications as specified in the primary smartphone application possibly including but not limited to wellness status check ins and or creating a direct connection.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the monitoring processes record movement of the phone over time. Based on the frequency and pattern of location and or accelerometer positioning movement the intelligent event identification engine may infer that the user is walking versus driving or vice versa. That information may then be recorded for further inferences by the intelligent event identification engine or used to notify authorized parties direct connect automated check in and or take some other action of the primary smartphone application .

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the monitoring processes record movement of the phone over time. The monitoring processes may also cause the phone s camera module to record one or more photographs and or video. The primary smartphone application may recognize the photo as dark and the intelligent event identification engine may recognize that a dark picture along with the frequency and positioning of the primary smartphone as determined by the GPS accelerometer wireless radio WAN and cellular system imply that the primary smartphone application user is a walking and may be carrying the primary smartphone in a bag or purse.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention camera module is used to take a picture of a prescription perhaps on a prescription bottle or carton or any other medium. The monitoring processes and specifically the intelligent event identification engine can use image character recognition and determine that the contents of the image are indeed a prescription based on characteristics common to all prescriptions such as medication name dosage frequency number of refills prescribing physician etc. . The primary smartphone application will then automatically directly through notification to the primary application system may electronically contact the pharmacy and or medical practice to request a refill and or renewal. The prescription information could also be redirected to create medication reminder alerts to take and or to refill that particular medication using the alerts capabilities of the primary smartphone application and or to update the medical profile on the primary smartphone application and or other third party software.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the monitoring processes may monitor the primary smartphone s battery for dissipation status and patterns of dissipation that may correlate with various dates days and or times. Similarly the monitoring processes may monitor the primary smartphone s signal strength for patterns of signal strength and loss based on location pattern and or date day and or time. In both situations the intelligent event identification engine may look for patterns to anticipate for the primary smartphone application user when the battery might run low and or signal strength might dissipate. In anticipating such an event an event notification may be triggered to notify the primary smartphone application user and or authorized external parties and may direct specific action such as ringing the primary smartphone application user and telling user visually and or audibly to plug in the phone and or to make any necessary calls now perhaps with reasons as to anticipated future phone status depending on the situation .

The same monitoring process and intelligent event identification engine are also used in several of the features of the invention described in the instant application.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention cellular and Internet connectivity to a mobile phone can be established automatically and or remotely when the mobile phone has been idle not having had a cellular and or Internet connection for some period.

In such instances a primary application system will send an electronic notification to the primary mobile smartphone via one or a combination of methods such as SMS text message cellular call VOIP call email or Internet connection. The primary mobile smartphone application will recognize the source of the call as being from the primary application system as pre configured in the software and will immediately initiate Internet protocol communication to the primary application system and or cellular communication to the phone s cellular network. If a connection cannot be made immediately the primary smartphone application can be configured to periodically re attempt both connection types Internet and or cellular connection until contact is made.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to periodically and or through a series of predetermined times and or via a pre determined trigger s as identified in the monitoring processes automatically turn on the mobile phone s location positioning features e.g. such as GPS multilateration of radio signals and or other mobile positioning technologies if location positioning features had been off then once on log the phone s location position with a date time stamp optionally automatically snap picture s and or video s and send all that linked data information via Internet cellular or other remote electronic connection to another user via an Internet website an email text message and or other form of electronic message.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to automatically send an event notification in the form of a call electronic and or otherwise or subsequent notification action and or trigger to the primary smartphone application the primary smartphone application user the primary application system the secondary smartphone application the web portal interface and or to an authorized external party e.g. 911 an urgent call center and or authorized care providers and or an Internet site if the mobile phone is dropped has not been moved or moved from a geographical location for a predetermined amount of time if the phone has not reached a predetermined geographical destination by a certain date and time if the mobile user has not checked in by pressing a special button on the phone by not satisfactorily answering a wellness check or mobile medical survey on the mobile phone and or by pressing a button on a separate wireless device linked connected with the mobile phone . All of these notification triggers are recognized through the intelligent event identification engine and processed accordingly. The monitoring process will recognize if any kind of action or notification event required partly based on the notification configuration . If so an event notification may be triggered.

The primary smartphone mobile application can be configured to remain in a listening status via its monitoring processes to automatically take action as defined above upon one or more of the following occurring 

The mobile application system can be configured to immediately notify user s and or primary application system immediately upon one of the foregoing events occurring and or initiate an inquiry to the mobile user and or remote user to check on the primary mobile application user s status. For example the mobile application can ask the user if they are alright visually and or audibly through texts pictures voice and or rings alarms and then listen for a response via a button press and or audio response possibly using voice recognition input of the monitoring processes . If the inquiry response is negative or there is no response the application system can then notify the authorized user s and or and or primary application systems and or for further action. Notification can be in any combination of the forms described above as well as logged for future access by authorized user s . The notification process flow for the primary smartphone application is shown and described in .

Notifications can be automated periodic events or asynchronous events caused by the primary smartphone application monitoring processes or through interactions or physical requests from primary mobile application users and or remote authorized users as described in this document and in the description of log triggering events in . As illustrated in a notification event is triggered. The monitoring processes will first identify recipients that are flagged to be notified for that particular notification event based on the primary smartphone application s configuration. The monitoring process will then determine if the notification is flagged as a critical event notification. If it is the notification will be sent to the predetermined recipients either directly and or through the primary application server . It will then return to the home or previous state.

If the notification event is not flagged as a critical notification then the monitoring process will check if the SYNC PERIOD time interval has been reached. If not the monitoring process will wait until the SYNC PERIOD time interval has been reached. Once the SYNC PERIOD time interval has been has been reached the monitoring process will check the battery status. If the battery power is below a minimum threshold BATT MIN the notification event will be logged and queued for the monitoring process to attempt at the next SYNC PERIOD time interval. If the battery power is sufficient at or greater than BATT MIN then the monitoring process will confirm whether any kind of call regular or direct connect is in session with the primary smartphone. If the primary smartphone application is unable to send the notification event while a call is in session it will log the event and queue it to send either when the call is completed or at the next SYNC PERIOD.

If the primary smartphone application can send during a call or if the primary smartphone is not in a call then the notification will be sent to the identified recipients either directly and or through the primary application server and the phone will then return to the home or previous state.

Option A. A predetermined time schedule determines periodic logging. LOGPERIOD denotes the time between logging runs as stored in the primary smartphone application database. The monitoring processes described in recognize when a scheduled logging is going to occur. For example LOGPERIOD could be set at every hour at which time the data called for to be logged in that log type is pooled together.

Option B. A change or event driven log. Examples include but are not limited to logging the responses of a wellness check logging if a user shakes the primary mobile smartphone to indicate an urgent 911 dial or dials 911 directly or through hot button logging a fall detection and user responses and or logging reminders and user responses.

Option C. An authorized remote user such as a caregiver can request a log of certain data related to the primary smartphone application including but not limited to phone movement history such as GPS location movement phone logging data around delivery and responses to wellness checks and or reminders including medication related reminders phone idleness any alerts etc. An example of when this might be attempted if a caregiver was concerned about the primary smartphone application user and the data visible as illustrated in was not as recent as the caregiver would like. In this case the caregiver could press a button on their secondary mobile application or the Internet portal application and trigger a collection of data to be logged and sent to the primary application system to be viewed on either system .

Each notification trigger of any notification trigger type will have FEATURES of data and information to be collected and logged. The monitoring processes include preconfigured definitions of these triggers and the data to be collected in regard to each. For example a periodic log may track location movement e.g. GPS or other location determining system phone movement even if in same location capture photos and or video to link with the location and phone movement and a date time stamp. The monitoring processes recognize the different data requirements of that log as determined in the configuration.

The monitoring processes will then look at the status of the battery life of the primary smartphone to see if the battery life is greater than a minimum power requirement BATT MIN. If the battery is below the BATT MIN level the primary smartphone application will add a local log on the primary smartphone application database indicating battery is too low to send the pooled data to the primary application server . It will abort the log attempt. However in a slightly altered version if the primary smartphone application determines that the primary smartphone has enough battery to send a basic message around the battery log but not enough battery to send the larger pooled data collection it may send a notification message to the primary application server indicating as such.

If there is enough battery power the monitoring processes will then determine whether the primary smartphone is on a call cellular or Internet VOIP based including whether it is a standard typical phone call or a direct connect call as described in this application. If any call type is in session the primary smartphone application will wait for a period of time to re attempt the call logging action as defined in LOG REATTEMPT. This assumes that the primary smartphone application is unable to log data at the same time a call is in session. If the smartphone allows the data to be logged while a call is in session and or if the mobile carrier allows for data to be separately sent while in a call then this step can be bypassed.

The monitoring processes of the primary smartphone application will then collect the data regarding the identified FEATURES. The monitoring processes will turn on if necessary any primary smartphone hardware or software component such as those identified in or primary smartphone application feature necessary to collect that data and then collect the data. Otherwise the data will simply be collected from the data store in the primary mobile application .

The data will then be written to the system log of the primary mobile application . It may also be sent to the primary application server as a notification event. The primary application will then return to the previous state of the application prior to the logging event.

The monitoring process for identifying a fall is illustrated in . In this example the primary smartphone application is actively listening and collecting the phone s accelerometer orientation positioning information according to a predefined interval PFREQ and storing the data in a log for comparison on the primary smartphone application . The application is then comparing the log of the data accelerometer orientation positioning data and determining whether the difference in the movement data points over a predetermined period of time PREQ is equal to or greater than ACCEL MAX indicating a high acceleration to warrant a consideration of a falling event.

Similarly the application is then comparing the log of the data accelerometer orientation positioning data and determining whether the vertical height location difference is equal to or greater than HGHT MAX indicating that the fall was from a large enough height to consider it a falling event for the purposes of checking in with the phone user .

If neither ACCEL MAX or HGHT MAX criteria are met the monitoring processes continue to listen for further events. However if both criteria as described are met then a falling event is stored in the log on the primary mobile application and potentially sent to the Primary Application System PAS . The user is then prompted to see if they are alright. If the user responds they are alright then the monitoring process resets and waits for the next event. If the user indicates they are not alright or does not respond at all the monitoring process logs event locally and may create a notification event to inform the PAS authorized remote user s and or 911.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to automatically notify specified users e.g. care providers via web portal application and secondary mobile application if calls are made to a predetermined list of phone number s . For example automatically notify authorized users via call electronic message or otherwise when the mobile user s doctors nurses therapists etc. are dialed and called and then log and or send that information with date time stamp via Internet and or cellular network using email SMS Internet upload or other electronic connectivity.

The smartphone application software can be configured to take specialized action based on a user making calls to certain phone numbers and or specified users. The actions can include notification events e.g. call electronic message or otherwise to authorized user s as well as logging of information in the primary system for later access by authorized user s . To initiate a third party conference or to take other kinds of actions described here the monitoring processes check call attempts against the configuration setup and matching numbers result in an event notification to corresponding systems and parties based on notification configuration .

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to automatically party conference the mobile phone with pre determined specified user s care provider s via telephonic and or Internet connectivity cellular VOIP hybrid cellular VOIP PBX and or other call conferencing technology when calls are made to specific predetermined phone number s . The smartphone application system can be pre configured and or updated through the configuration process with specific phone numbers that when dialed from the primary smartphone result in a party line conference call to pre determined specified user s via telephonic and or Internet connectivity.

In one example a call to predetermined phone number results in a notification to an authorized third party via SMS email or secondary mobile application . The secondary mobile application will receive a notification with optional response button s . Clicking the response buttons results in either direct notification to the primary smartphone application via electronic communication SMS internet or other causing the primary smartphone to auto conference the secondary mobile application s phone number or indirect notification to the primary smartphone application via electronic communication SMS internet or other to the primary application system that notifies the primary smartphone application to initiate a conference call inclusive of the secondary smartphone application and the intended phone number. Alternatively the primary application system may initiate the party conference to the primary smartphone application the secondary smartphone application and the intended phone number.

It should be noted that all embodiments of the method and system descried in the instant application related to auto conferencing should be construed to include conferencing in pre authorized users on any phone in addition or substitution to a secondary mobile application phone and or to the pre authorized user s web portal application . However the secondary mobile application and the web portal application allows for the interactivity of response including but not limited to prompting the pre authorized user to be conference called by the system or possibly to have the primary smartphone application or primary application system record the phone call or simply ignore the call. This type of interactive response may also be achieved by other phones not running the secondary smartphone application software through either specific text SMS interaction and responses and or audio request with voice recognition and or number responses on the phone keypad that are interpreted by the primary smartphone application and or primary application system to take one or any of the actions described above.

The conferencing process of the system may work as described above and or in one or a combination of the following three methods 

Option The primary smartphone application system uses the cellular network s party conference capability to automatically dial the number being called as well as the pre authorized user s .

Option The primary smartphone application does not actually dial the number specified but alternatively dials a different phone number that connects with a remote application system via cellular Internet and or hybrid cellular Internet method or other . The remote application system creates a party conference with the primary smartphone user the originally intended phone number and the pre authorized user s .

In either process the primary smartphone application will send an electronic notification to the remote application system either before making the call as in Option or upon pressing the dial button as in Option . The remote application system via monitoring processes will then recognize the call as a party conference call log the action request optionally notify pre authorized users via electronic application notification text and or email and or other notification event and initiate the telephone calls.

Option Upon pressing the dial button the initiating primary smartphone application first sends a notification to pre configured authorized user s phones which as previously described may or may not use a secondary mobile application or web portal application as well as to a remote application system via electronic data and or telephonic means including using cellular Internet and or hybrid cellular Internet means . The authorized user s may see the action being initiated through a secondary remote application on their mobile phone and or via a text message email Internet web portal and or other electronic and or telephonic notification. The authorized user s can then respond to the notification to 

If the authorized user responds that they would not like the call to be placed the call is not placed and the original user may be notified via the primary smartphone application the remote application system and or directly via an electronic and or telephonic means to the initiating primary smartphone .

If the authorized user responds that they would like to participate in the call the electronic and or telephone response is sent either directly to the initiating primary smartphone or indirectly via the remote application system . At that point the party conference can be created either directly from the initiating primary smartphone as described in Option or from the remote application system as described in Option .

Using either process the smartphone application can be set to automatically record the conversation via the primary smartphone application or the primary application system . Either system can also be set to automatically send notification using the same means as described herein.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to allow the primary mobile user or an authorized user care provider to create custom automated wellness checks or surveys that the mobile user responds to once or periodically and which can have custom actions associated with particular responses and or results based on software customization. illustrates an example of an automated wellness check question according to the principles of the system and method of the present invention.

In the disclosed embodiment of the system and method of the present invention the system and method of the present invention is configured to recognize a shaking pattern and or a voice through voice recognition that results in the primary mobile phone answering the phone and or resulting in taking other pre determined actions instead of pushing a button to answer the phone or take an action .

A predefined physical shaking pattern is into the primary mobile smartphone application which then senses changes in movement based on the accelerometer gyroscopic technology embedded in the phone. In a process similar to the fall detection monitoring process shown and described in if the primary mobile user shakes the phone in a manner consistent with a predefined pattern in which acceleration timing is greater than a minimum pre defined value and direction change indicates a pattern of movement over a short distance less than a pre defined value followed abruptly by inverted movement over a similar short distance and then repeated at minimum a number of predefined number of times the primary mobile smartphone application can recognize the pattern via the monitoring processes and the intelligent event identification engine and take predetermined actions such as answering an incoming call and or taking the response to mean an answer to a question such as yes or no to a phone survey as described elsewhere in the instant application or to initiate a call to a phone number such as 911 or an urgent call center that has been pre linked to a particular pattern.

In the disclosed embodiment of the invention the primary mobile smartphone application can prompt the mobile user for whether they would like to answer the phone dial a user and or take similar action and then utilize established voice recognition VR technology via APIs into that VR software to await a predetermined voice response such as Yes or Answer . Using the monitoring processes previously described the intelligent event identification engine can recognize and match the pattern it sees consult the configuration and create appropriate event notifications .

In the disclosed embodiment of the invention the primary mobile smartphone application and or the secondary mobile application is configured to allow the mobile user to switch back and forth between standard telephonic cellular based audio phone connectivity and a VOIP Internet based audio and or video connection including while a phone call is underway or while it may appear to the user that the phone call is underway.

While a call is underway the user can switch among a standard telephonic cellular based audio call a VOIP based audio call and a VOIP based audio video call. This is initiated by either the primary mobile user pressing a button to switch as illustrated in on the primary mobile application in call screen or by a remote user such as a remote authorized user pressing a similar button on their in call screen of the secondary mobile application the web portal application interface and or a special version of a secondary mobile application that is designed specifically for possibly non authorized remote users in order to leverage the video streaming VOIP client that the primary application system utilizes and requires to make a video VOIP call. Such as connection switch between audio and or video and audio may be accomplished as follows 

When the existing call is standard telephonic cellular based audio call and the initiating user clicks to switch to either a VOIP based audio or audio video call the process of the system and method of the present invention as illustrated in is as follows 

When the initiating user is in a standard telephonic cellular based audio call they will have the option to select a button that indicates they can switch to a VOIP call and possibly given choice whether to maintain audio only or go to video and audio VOIP call . The VOIP call button is only active if the local application which could be or of the initiating user has that particular contact in the phonebook flagged in the local database as having VOIP access. Alternatively the local application can check that the remote application has VOIP connectivity after the initiating user clicks on the switch button. Upon clicking the switch button the application may confirm intentions with the initiating user. A positive response results in the initiating application showing a message to initiating user to wait while the VOIP connection is established. The initiating application s or VOIP client will then initiate a VOIP connection to the same contact as the telephonic phone number as linked in the local application or database. This will be accomplished through the primary application server s PAS VOIP server. The PAS will electronically confirm the recipient mobile application s status of its VOIP client to confirm that it exists is enabled and possibly that it is connected to the Internet and possibly the strength of connection.

If unable to confirm these facets the PAS will send an electronic message to the initiating mobile application that the other party does not have VOIP available and the standard telephonic audio call will continue. If the call has already been dropped for any reason including dropped by the initiating application in order to attempt a VOIP connection then the message from the PAS will trigger the initiating application to auto dial the original contact phone number and the recipient mobile application will recognize the phone number and may automatically pick up the standard telephonic phone call.

If the PAS is able to confirm that the recipient mobile application s VOIP client s status i.e. that it exists is enabled and possibly that it is connected to the Internet and possibly connection strength then the PAS s VOIP server will reach out to the recipient application s VOIP client and establish a bridge connection with the initiating application s VOIP client.

At any point after initiating the switch either the initiating mobile application or the PAS will have notified the recipient remote application to disconnect the standard telephonic audio call and enable if disabled the recipient mobile application s VOIP client. If the notification came from the initiating mobile application then the initiating mobile application will also disconnect the audio call on its own phone. If the notification came from the PAS the PAS will also notify the initiating mobile application to disconnect from the standard telephonic call likely after confirming that a VOIP connection could be established.

When the existing call is a VOIP based audio or audio video call and the initiating user wants to switch between VOIP based audio and audio video the VOIP connection will toggle back and forth in what is an established process for the VOIP connection.

When the existing call is a VOIP based audio or audio video call and the initiating user wants to switch to a standard telephonic cellular based audio call perhaps because the Internet connection is not strong at the moment and the initiating mobile application indicates to user that cellular signal strength is strong the initiating user clicks on a button to switch during the call and the process of the system and method of the present invention as illustrated in is as follows 

When the initiating user is in a VOIP based audio or audio video call they will have the option to select a button that indicates they can switch to a standard telephonic audio based cellular call. Upon clicking the switch button the application may confirm intentions with the initiating user. A positive response will cause the initiating application to then check whether a cellular signal is available and possibly strong enough . If not a message will indicate this to the user and the existing VOIP based call will continue. Alternatively initiating application could continuously check status of cellular signal and disable switch when cellular signal is not available.

Assuming the cellular signal is present and possibly strong enough the initiating application will message the initiating user to wait while a standard call is established. The initiating application will then initiate a cellular call to the recipient application s phone.

If both initiating and recipient application s are able to maintain both a VOIP connection and standard cellular connection simultaneously then the recipient application will recognize the phone number via the contact link in the application s database and automatically pick up the phone. At that point the VOIP connection could be dropped by the initiating application the receiving application or the PAS s VOIP server.

If either the initiating or recipient application s phone or both are unable to simultaneously maintain a VOIP connection and standard cellular connection simultaneously then either the initiating application the recipient application or the PAS will cause the VOIP client to drop the connection prior to initiating the cellular call. The initiating mobile application would have electronically communicated the intention of the connection switch to both the PAS and recipient application via electronic communication methods possibly including via VOIP connection other internet connection or SMS.

In the disclosed embodiment of the invention VOIP calls can be made from the outset not only switched during calls via the primary mobile application the secondary mobile application and or the web application system . The local phonebook database within all those applications is configured to register whether a contact has registered a compatible VOIP client with the PAS .
