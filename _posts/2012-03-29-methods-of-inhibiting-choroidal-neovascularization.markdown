This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10 665 203 filed Sep. 18 2003 which issued on Apr. 24 2012 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 163 726 B2 which is a nonprovisional application of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 412 088 filed on Sep. 18 2002 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was supported in part by Grant Nos. Y12727 from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to compositions and methods for inhibiting unwanted angiogenesis including that of ocular tissues. In particular compositions and methods for the treatment of choroidal neovasculature CNV in ocular diseases are provided. While the invention is exemplified with respect to rapamycin sirolimus and tacrolimus the invention provides for the use of the family of limus compounds to inhibit unwanted angiogenesis.

The retina of the eye contains the cones and rods that detect colors. In the center of the retina is the macula lutea which is about to cm in diameter. The macula provides detailed vision particularly in the center the fovea because the cones are higher in density. Blood vessels ganglion cells inner nuclear layer and cells and the plexiform layers are all displaced to one side rather than resting above the cones thereby allowing light a more direct path to the cones.

Under the retina are the choroid comprising a collection of blood vessels embedded within a fibrous tissue and the deeply pigmented epithelium which overlays the choroid layer. The choroidal blood vessels provide nutrition to the retina particularly its visual cells .

There are a variety of retinal disorders whose current treatment is not optimal. The retina may tear form holes and separate from the underlying choroid.

Age related macular degeneration AMD is the major cause of severe visual loss in the United States for individuals over the age of 55. AMD occurs in either an atrophic or less commonly an exudative form. In exudative AMD blood vessels grow from the choriocapillaris through defects in Bruch s membrane and in some cases the underlying retinal pigment epithelium choroidal neovascularization or angiogenesis . Organization of serous or hemorrhagic exudates escaping from these vessels results in fibrovascular scarring of the macular region with attendant degeneration of the neuroretina detachment and tears of the retinal pigment epithelium vitreous hemorrhage and permanent loss of central vision. This process is responsible for more than 80 of cases of significant visual loss in patients with AMD.

Several studies have recently described the use of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of initial or recurrent neovascular lesions associated with AMD Macular Photocoagulation Study Groups 1991 in 109 1220 109 1232 109 1242 . Unfortunately AMD patients with subfoveal lesions subjected to laser treatment experienced a rather precipitous reduction in visual acuity mean 3 lines at 3 months follow up. Moreover at two years post treatment treated eyes had only marginally better visual acuity than their untreated counterparts means of 20 320 and 20 400 respectively . Another drawback of the procedure is that vision after surgery is immediately worse.

Choroidal neovascularization CNV has proven recalcitrant to treatment in most cases. Laser treatment can ablate CNV and help to preserve vision in selected cases not involving the center of the retina but this is limited to only about 10 of the cases. There is no other treatment available to correct CNV. Unfortunately even with successful laser photocoagulation the neovascularization recurs in about 50 70 of eyes 50 over 3 years and 60 at 5 years . Macular Photocoagulation Study Group 204 694 701 1986 . In addition many patients who develop CNV are not good candidates for laser therapy because the CNV is too large for laser treatment or the location cannot be determined so that the physician cannot accurately aim the laser. Thus until the present invention there has been a long felt need for methods that will prevent or significantly inhibit choroidal neovascularization.

In addition to AMD choroidal neovascularization is caused by such retinal disorders as presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome myopic degeneration angioid streaks and ocular trauma. Angiogenic damage associated with retinal and intravitreal neovascularization occurs in a wide range of disorders including diabetic retinopathy venous occlusions sickle cell retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity retinal detachment ocular ischemia and trauma.

Citation of the above documents is not intended as an admission that any of the foregoing is pertinent prior art. All statements as to the date or representation as to the contents of these documents is based on the information available to the applicant and does not constitute any admission as to the correctness of the dates or contents of these documents.

The present invention provides compositions and methods that are effective in inhibiting unwanted angiogenesis specifically choroidal neovascularization CNV that is associated with ocular diseases such as age related macular degeneration AMD and histoplasmosis syndrome. Compositions of the invention for inhibiting angiogenesis comprise active agents in the limus family of compounds which bind to members of the immunophilin family of cellular proteins including cyclophilins and FK506 binding proteins FKBPs to inhibit angiogenesis in choroidal membranes. Non limiting members of the limus family of compounds include sirolimus rapamycin and its water soluble analog SDZ RAD tacrolimus everolimus pimecrolimus CCI 779 Wyeth AP23841 Ariad and ABT 578 Abbott Laboratories as well as analogs and derivatives thereof.

A therapeutic amount of the active agents of the invention may be administered to a patient by a variety of different routes and can be given in dosages that are safe and provide angiogenic inhibition at internal sites. The present invention thus provides methods of treating mammalian diseases characterized by undesired and uncontrolled angiogenesis by administering a composition comprising one or more active agents of the invention. In a particular embodiment of the invention methods to inhibit or treat choroidal neovascularization CNV of the eye are provided.

Thus the present invention is especially useful for treating certain ocular neovascular diseases such as macular degeneration including age related macular degeneration AMD . The invention is particularly useful in the treatment or inhibition of the wet form of AMD wherein blood vessels grow from their normal location in the choroids into an undesirable position under the retina. Leakage and bleeding from these new blood vessels results in vision loss and possibly blindness. The invention also provides methods for inhibiting the transition from the dry form of AMD wherein the retinal pigment epithelium or RPE degenerates and leads to photoreceptor cell death and the formation of yellow deposits called drusen under the retina to the wet form of AMD. The invention thus also provides methods for the treatment of the dry form of AMD.

Compounds which are contemplated for use in the present invention are administered to the patient to halt the progression of the disease and permit reductions in or regression of the neovascularization. Other diseases that can be treated using the present invention include but are not limited to diabetic retinopathy neovascular glaucoma and retrolental fibroplasia.

Accordingly and in a first aspect the invention provides compounds compositions kits and methods to inhibit unwanted angiogenesis as well as neovascularization in the retina of a human or animal. In a second aspect the invention provides a treatment for diseases mediated by angiogenesis or choroidal neovascularization in a subject. In a further aspect the invention provides methods for preventing inhibiting or treating the wet form of AMD including inhibiting the loss of vision associated therewith.

Another aspect of the invention is the use of the above described methods in combination with other methods known for the treatment of angiogenesis neovascularization and the wet form of AMD as well as reducing the loss of visual acuity associated therewith. Moreover the invention provides methods for the visualization of blood vessels by use of lipophilic dyes in a body as well as an animal model for choroidal neovascularization that can be applied as an assay for rapid identification of additional anti angiogenic anti neovascularization and anti AMD compounds.

Advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description examples and figures which follow all of which are intended to be for illustrative purposes only and not intended in any way to limit the invention and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art on examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention.

The invention provides methods for the treatment of disorders involving angiogenesis and neovascularization including ophthalmic disorders and in particular retinal disorders involving macular degeneration choroidal neovascularization and the like in the retina or between the retina and its underlying choroidal tissue or involving choroidal tissue as described above. The methods comprise a novel use for the immune suppressor rapamycin which is also known as macrocyclic lactone sirolimus commercially available as Rapamune Wyeth Ayerst See Physician s Desk Reference 55.sup.th edition . According to the Merck Index 12.sup.th edition Rapamune is also known as RAPA RPM sirolimus AY22989 and NSC 226080.

Although Sirolimus is known as an immunosuppressant it has been reported as an anti angiogenic compound in the context of primary and metastatic tumors Guba et al. Nature Medicine 18 2 128 135 February 2002 and Guba et al. Chir. Forum Exp. Klin. Forsch. Band 30 pages 37 39 2001 . In those studies there is no discussion related to other types of neovascularization such as choroidal neovascularization. Instead there is a discussion of the involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and the serum levels thereof. VEGF is a factor implicated in numerous indications without certainty that therapies directed thereto are efficacious in treating said indications. For example VEGF has been suggested as involved in the formation of pathogenic new vessels in AMD although VEGF activity has never been tested in an animal model with regard to AMD. Therefore the ability to treat AMD by targeting VEGF activity remains experimental.

In addition to the use of sirolimus the invention provides for the use of other immunophilin binding compounds as well as rapamycin derivatives and analogs to treat angiogenesis and neovascularization. Non limiting examples of such compounds include SDZ RAD tacrolimus everolimus pimecrolimus CCI 779 Wyeth AP23841 Ariad and ABT 578 Abbott Laboratories as well as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 527 907 6 376 517 and 6 329 386. Additional derivatives include those disclosed in published U.S. Patent application 2002 0123505. All of these documents are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth.

The invention also provides for the use of the above agents in combination with other agents and therapies for the treatment of angiogenesis or neovascularization particularly CNV. Non limiting examples of such additional agents and therapies include pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate NF.kappa.B inhibitor squalamine TPN 470 analogue and fumagillin PKC protein kinase C inhibitors Tie 1 and Tie 2 kinase inhibitors inhibitors of VEGF receptor kinase proteasome inhibitors such as Velcade bortezomib for injection ranibizumab Lucentis and other antibodies directed to the same target pegaptanib Macugen vitronectin receptor antagonists such as cyclic peptide antagonists of vitronectin receptor type integrins .alpha. v .beta. 3 integrin antagonists .alpha. v .beta. 1 integrin antagonists thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone or troglitazone interferon including .gamma. interferon or interferon targeted to CNV by use of dextran and metal coordination pigment epithelium derived factor PEDF endostatin angiostatin anecortave acetate acetonide triamcinolone tetrathiomolybdate RNA silencing or RNA interference RNAi of angiogenic factors including ribozymes that target VEGF expression Accutane 13 cis retinoic acid ACE inhibitors such as quinapril or perindopril inhibitors of mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin 3 aminothalidomide pentoxifylline 2 methoxyestradiol colchicines AMG 1470 cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as nepafenac rofecoxib and diclofenac t RNA synthase modulator metalloprotease 13 inhibitor acetylcholinesterase inhibitor potassium channel blockers endorepellin purine analog of 6 thioguanine cyclic peroxide ANO 2 recombinant arginine deiminase epigallocatechin 3 gallate cerivastatin analogues of suramin VEGF trap molecules Visudyne and other photosensitizers with photodynamic therapy PDT and laser photocoagulation.

 Macular degeneration is characterized by the excessive buildup of fibrovascular deposits in or beneath the macula and retina and the atrophy and or dislodgement of the retinal pigment epithelium RPE . The administration of rapamycin appears to limit excessive angiogenesis such as choroidal neovascularization in age related macular degeneration AMD which may occur without such treatment. As used herein the term angiogenesis means the generation of new blood vessels neovascularization into a tissue or organ. An angiogenesis mediated disease or condition of the eye or retina is one in which new blood vessels are generated in a pathogenic manner in the eye or retina resulting in loss of vision or other problem e.g. choroidal neovascularization associated with AMD.

The methods of the invention include a preferred embodiment using rapamycin and or other active agents in vitro or in vivo. When administered in vitro the method is used for example to screen for or assay the effects of additional candidate active agents for the activity of controlling or reducing neovascularization or angiogenesis in retinal or choroidal tissue or cells. This may be used as a helpful assay for additional anti angiogenesis or CNV agents. When administered in vivo the method is used for example to treat a patient having a predisposition to develop the choroidal neovascularization typically seen in AMD or to prevent or inhibit choroidal neovascularization in such a patient or to reduce choroidal neovascularization in an AMD patient. Prevent inhibit and reduce are given their ordinary meanings with regard to the effect of the active agents of the invention on choroidal neovascularization. A patient having a predisposition or in need of prevention may be identified by the skilled practitioner by established methods and criteria in the field. The skilled practitioner may also readily diagnose individuals as in need of inhibition or treatment based upon established criteria in the field for identifying unwanted angiogenesis and or neovascularization.

An effective amount of the drug is that amount which provides the therapeutic effect sought e.g. an therapeutically effective dose of rapamycin or drug equivalent would be the amount which reduces choroidal neovascularization in an AMD patient or which inhibits or completely prevents choroidal neovascularization in a patient predisposed to AMD or who even without predisposition shows early signs of AMD. Thus the therapeutically effective dose may not be the same in every patient treated with rapamycin. An effective amount also refers to the amount of drug which inhibits angiogenesis or neovascularization in a model or assay therefor such as that disclosed by the present invention.

 Patient preferably refers to a subject who has or who may develop choroidal neovascularization associated with exudative AMD unless treated by the preferred methods of the present invention. Such a patient is preferably a mammal more preferably a human although the present methods are also application to model experimental animals and veterinary animal subjects.

An active agent of the invention such as rapamycin is preferably administered orally intravenously topically intraocularly intramuscularly locally or in an ocular device. More preferably the mode of administration is selected from the following intraocular injection subretinal injection subscleral injection intrachoroidal injection subconjunctival injection topical administration oral administration and parenteral administration. Most preferably the active agent is directly administered to the retinal area by subretinal injection although less invasive modes of administration may be developed that are equally as effective. Formulations for timed release or delayed release over time are also provided by the present invention.

The dosage of the active agent will depend on the condition being treated the particular agent and other clinical factors such as weight and condition of the human or animal and the route of administration of the agent. It is to be understood that the present invention has application for both human and veterinary use. For administration to humans an effective dosage is one that inhibits choroidal neovascularization. In the case of rapamycin an inhibiting amount that can be employed ranges generally between about 0.1 to 300 mg kg day preferably between approximately 0.5 and 50 mg kg day and most preferably between approximately 1 to 10 mg kg day. Dosages of various agents of the invention for treating various conditions can be refined by the use of clinical trials on the present invention. Additionally dose ranges for the practice of the invention include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 376 517 and 5 387 589 which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth.

An active agent of the invention such as rapamycin may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and or may contain conventional adjuvants such as preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers buffers etc. The agents may also be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for clinical use to produce a pharmaceutical composition. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oil in water liquid emulsion or a water in oil emulsion and as a bolus etc. Stated differently the active agents of the invention may be used to prepare a medicament for the treatment of any of the conditions described herein.

For administration an active agent such as rapamycin may be combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate for the indicated route of administration. The active agent may be admixed with lactose sucrose starch powder cellulose esters of alkanoic acids stearic acid talc magnesium stearate magnesium oxide sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulphuric acids acacia gelatin sodium alginate polyvinylpyrrolidine and or polyvinyl alcohol and tableted or encapsulated for conventional administration. Alternatively the compounds of this invention may be dissolved in polyethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethyl cellulose colloidal solutions ethanol corn oil peanut oil cottonseed oil sesame oil tragacanth gum and or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well known in the pharmaceutical art and may be used in the practice of the invention. The carrier or diluent may include time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax or other materials well known in the art.

The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral ophthalmic including intravitreal or intracameral nasal topical including buccal and sublingual or parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intratracheal and epidural administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier s or excipient s . In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into associate the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Further provided in another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent of the invention such as rapamycin and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for administration to the eye or eye tissue.

In addition a kit is provided comprising at least one vial comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent of the invention such as rapamycin and a second vial comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for administration to the eye or eye tissue. Other kits of the invention comprise components such as the active agent of the invention for use in the practice of the methods disclosed herein wherein containers each with one or more of the various reagents typically in concentrated form utilized in the methods including for example buffers and other reagents as necessary are also included. A label or indicator describing or a set of instructions for use of kit components in a method of the present invention will also be typically included where the instructions may be associated with a package insert and or the packaging of the kit or the components thereof.

Diseases associated with retinal choroidal neovascularization that can be treated according to the present invention include but are not limited to diabetic retinopathy macular degeneration retinopathy of prematurity infections causing a retinitis or choroiditis presumed ocular histoplasmosis myopic degeneration angioid streaks ocular trauma and AMD. Other non limiting examples of diseases and unwanted conditions that may be treated with the present invention include but are not limited to pseudoxanthoma elasticum vein occlusion artery occlusion carotid obstructive disease Sickle Cell anemia Eales disease myopia chronic retinal detachment hyperviscosity syndromes toxoplasmosis trauma and post laser complications. Other diseases include but are not limited to diseases associated with rubeosis neovascularization of the angle and diseases caused by the abnormal proliferation of fibrovascular or fibrous tissue including all forms of proliferative vitreoretinopathy whether or not associated with diabetes.

In addition to the compositions and methods for the treatment of unwanted conditions the invention also provides methods for the visualization of blood vessels in a body. Such methods may also be viewed as methods of detectably labeling blood vessels in a body for subsequent visualization. Conventional ways to process tissue samples for blood vessel visualization are both labor intensive and time consuming. To improve the efficiency in tissue preparation a technique called Vessel Painting is provided by the present invention. The basic concept of Vessel Painting is to selectively stain the inner lining of blood vessels with fluorescent dye. Blood vessels are lined with endothelial cell membrane a lipid bilayer membrane that can be stained directly with a lipophilic dye. The key to this technique is a specially formulated solution the Vessel Paint which contains a lipophilic dye. Non limiting examples of such dyes are available from Molecular Probes and they include DiI DiO DiO DiD DiA and DiR which are long chain dialkylcarbocyanines and dialkylaminostyryl dyes used as neuronal tracers. By intracardiac perfusion of an animal with Vessel Paint followed by a wash optionally in a fixative solution such as but not limited to 4 paraformaldehyde solution blood vessels are stained instantaneously. Tissues can be viewed by fluorescence microscopy immediately after perfusion. The staining is remarkably bright with very low background so that high contrast images can be obtained using objective lenses of different magnification powers.

The invention also provides for an animal model of ocular neovascularization. The model is discussed in detail below but generally it is based upon the injection of material into the subretinal space of an animal s eye. Any suitable non human animal model for ocular disease may be used and the injected material may range from Matrigel an extract of extracellular matrix ECM proteins from the murine EHS Engelbreth Holm Swarm tumor that is widely used as reconstituted basement membrane in cell culture experiments to a simple solution of rat tail collagen I bovine collagen I and human collagen I such as that available from BD Biosciences . See Gautreau A. et. al. PNAS 96 7300. 1999 Abir R. et al. Hum Reprod 14 299. 1999 and Abir R. et al. Fertil Steril 75 141. 2001 . Other sources of collagen may be used including those produced by using lyophilized collagen such as rat tail collagen from Roche dissolved in 0.1 DME pH 4.0 DME power from Life technologies without NaHCO make a 10 solution but with the pH color indicator and use HCl to adjust pH to 4.0 then dilute this solution with water to make the 0.1 DME solution and a 10 acetic acid solution.

Without being bound by theory and offered to improve the understanding of the invention the injection of a collagen or protein solution is believed to be sufficient to mimic the abnormal deposits that occur in AMD after injection into the subretinal space of rats to induce new blood vessels invasion. Such animal models may be advantageously used to screen candidate active agents of the invention for activity against angiogenesis neovascularization such as CNV and AMD. Non limiting examples of such methods include those comprising the administration by any method disclosed herein of a candidate agent to said animal and determining the effect increase decrease or no change on angiogenesis or neovascularization in said animal.

The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent that the experiments below are all and only experiments performed. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used e.g. amounts temperature etc. but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise parts are parts by weight molecular weight is weight average molecular weight temperature is in degrees Celsius and pressure is at or near atmospheric.

Within this application unless otherwise stated the techniques utilized may be found in any of several well known references such as Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 Guide to Protein Purification in M. P. Deutshcer ed. 1990 Academic Press Inc. 2nd Ed. Liss Inc. New York N.Y. 1987 .

In search of effective treatments for CNV a simple animal model was created by injecting 2 3.mu.l Matrigel to the subretinal space of adult Sprague Dawley rats using a 33 gauge needle connected to a 10.mu.l Hamilton microsyringe. A week or more later the animals were sacrificed by CO.sub.2 inhalation and perfused with Vessel Paint a new visualization technique recently developed in the inventors lab that enables screening agents including chemical compounds and proteins for their potential in inhibiting CNV Wen ARVO Abstract March 2002 . Vessel Painting comprises the use of a solution containing DiI followed by 4 paraformaldehyde solution and is discussed further below.

The anterior portion of the eye including the cornea and lens was removed and the eyecup was imbedded in 5 agarose. Serial thick sections 100.mu.m of the eye were cut on a vibratome and mounted on glass slides. Eye sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy for neovascularization in the Matrigel deposit. Serial optical sections were obtained using confocal microscopy. Three dimensional reconstruction of newly developed blood vessels was achieved using Auto Visualiz 3D Autoquant Imaging Inc. . Protein leakage of the new vessels was detected by assessing color change in the Matrigel deposit after intravenous injection of Evan s Blue dye.

Neovascularization was observed as early as 7 days after Matrigel injection and extensive CNV was evident 10 days after Matrigel injection in all of the eyes injected. New blood vessels originated from choriocapillaris exclusively invaded the Matrigel deposit and formed extensive networks 14 days after Matrigel injection. Three dimensional reconstruction clearly showed that the new vessels originated from the choroid. The Matrigel deposit became light blue in color after Evan s blue injection as compared with pale white surrounding tissue indicating the lack of barrier. Disciform scar was observed 30 days after Matrigel injection.

Thus the subretinal Matrigel deposits induce CNV in the subretinal space mimicking the pathology seen in exudative or wet form AMD and thereby providing an improved animal model for researching the pathology of CNV and for testing potential therapies.

In the initial characterization of the model it was suspected that there was a possible involvement of an inflammatory reaction to Matrigel in the generation of neovascularization. As a result two known immunosuppressants were tested cyclosporin and rapamycin.

Oral administration of cyclosporin 15 mg kg d given 4 days before Matrigel injection thorough 10 days after injection had no effect on CNV. In marked contrast however oral rapamycin Rapamune 1.5 mg kg d given 4 days before Matrigel injection thorough 10 days after injection resulted in complete inhibition of CNV development in the 16 eyes tested. Rapamycin is commercially available as oral solution marketed as Rapamune Oral Solution by Wyeth Ayerst. Thus the anti CNV properties of rapamycin by local administration were further examined.

Since rapamycin is not soluble in water it was either dissolved in DMSO tested in 8 eyes or suspended in PBS tested in 6 eyes then mixed with Matrigel . The mixed Matrigel containing rapamycin was injected to the subretinal space. At a dose of 25 rapamycin or 30 g injection since each injection used 1.2 l of Matrigel there was again a complete inhibition of CNV in rapamycin treated eyes.

In further experiments and using the methods described above the amount of rapamycin was reduced to 2.5 g L. At this amount the word concentration is not being used since rapamycin is not soluble in water the crystals of rapamycin were clearly visible even after 10 days. In each case there was no detectable neovascularization in treated eyes. Concerns with insolubility if they exist may be addressed by the use of soluble active agents of the invention such as but not limited to SDZ RAD.

Rapamycin thus has the potential to inhibit or prevent CNV in human patients. In addition local administration of rapamycin is evidently a practical approach to CNV treatment which is particularly advantageous given the potential disadvantages effects of systemic administration.

The retina from a normal 3 months old Sprague Dawley rat sacrificed by COoverdose was perfused with Vessel Paint DiI 0.1 mg ml followed by 4 paraformaldehyde. The retina was dissected and postfixed in the same fixative for 1 hr rinsed in phosphate buffered saline PBS and flat mounted on glass slides. Microphotographs were taken on a Nikon E800 microscope.

Microphotographs of the flat mount retina showed that vessels stain brightly with a low background. Endothelial cell nuclei were also stained and easily identifiable. The spatial structure of the vasculature was well preserved and the deep retinal capillaries were also visible.

The vascular network is better appreciated by images to show its three dimensionality. Excellent 3 D images of vasculature can be obtained using the corrosion casting technique and scanning electron microscopy SEM see Konerding M A 1991 Scanning electron microscopy of corrosion casting in medicine. 5 851 865. However corrosion casting is technically challenging and time consuming as is SEM. Alternatively 3 D images can be reconstructed from a stack of serial optical sections by confocal microscopy. Bright staining and a high signal to noise ratio by Vessel Painting make it possible to obtain serial optical sections of samples as thick as 100 150 m by laser scanning confocal microscopy without significant deterioration of signal from the bottom of the sample even using objective lenses of low magnification power. High quality of 3 D images at different viewing angles can be reconstructed from a stack of 2 D digital images using commercially available software. shows 3 D reconstructed images of a flat mounted retina processed as described above. A stack of 78 optical sections along the Z axis z step 1 m was taken by confocal microscopy using a 20 objective lens on a Bio Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Three D images were reconstructed to show the retinal vasculature at an angle of 0 or 180 . Both depict an artery on the retinal surface with connections to the deep capillaries.

Matrigel is an extract of extracellular matrix ECM proteins from the murine EHS Engelbreth Holm Swarm tumor and is widely used as reconstituted basement membrane in cell culture experiments. It is also used to assess angiogenic or antiangiogenic agents in an in vivo assay the Matrigel plug assay Passaniti A Taylor R M Pili R et al. 1992 A simple quantitative method for assessing angiogenesis and antiangiogenic agents using reconstituted basement membrane heparin and fibroblast growth factor. 67 519 528 . Pathological studies indicate an association between CNV and abnormal deposits of extracellular matrix ECM in the location between the retinal pigment epithelium RPE and Bruch s membrane. In order to mimic the abnormal deposits that occur in AMD Matrigel was injected into the subretinal space of rats. New blood vessels invade Matrigel deposits shortly after Matrigel injection.

In the following Matrigel 1.2 l was introduced to the subretinal space by injection into eyes of Sprague Dawley rats. At a given time after injection the animal was sacrificed and perfused with Vessel Paint followed by 4 paraformaldehyde solution. The anterior portion of the eye was removed and the eyecup was then embedded in 5 agarose. Serial cross sections 100 m thick were cut on a vibratome.

New blood vessels originating from the choriocapillaris were detectable as early as 4 days after Matrigel injection and became well developed by 10 days after injection. A DIC image of a cross section of an eye from a 2 month old animal 10 days after Matrigel injection is shown in . The DIC image was superimposed with an optical section to show CNV along with choroidal and retinal vasculature . New blood vessels penetrate Bruch s membrane at a single site yellow arrowhead and then ramify in the Matrigel layer between the RPE and the retina. A stack of 42 optical sections were taken from this sample and a 3 D image was reconstructed . The 3 D image clearly shows that the new blood vessels originated from the choriocapillaris through a single penetration site yellow arrowhead .

The permeability of newly formed blood vessels was assessed by Evans Blue assay. Evans Blue 60 mg kg in PBS was injected intravenously to a Sprague Dawley rat whose eyes had been injected with Matrigel 10 days before. A choroid retina preparation was dissected flat mounted and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Evans Blue staining was only seen in the Matrigel injected area indicating the leaky nature of the new vessels.

Adult Sprague Dawley rats n 22 were injected with Matrigel to the subretinal space. Animals were fed with rapamycin once a day at a dose of 3 mg kg started 4 days before Matrigel injection. Eyes were collected at 10 days n 18 or 20 days n 4 after Matrigel injection and processed as described in Example 4. Tissue sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy. None of the eyes collected at 10 days contained any new blood vessels invading the subretinal space in rapamycin treated animals. In the 20 days group some newly formed blood vessels started to invade the Matrigel area. The amount of CNV in this group was semiquantified as . In comparison CNV in control animals 10 days were graded as as shown in .

In another group of animals rapamycin was mixed with Matrigel suspension 1 g l n 6 10 g l n 11 and co injected to the subretinal space with Matrigel in gel delivery . Eyes were collected 10 days after injection and processed as described in Example 4. No CNV was found in any of the eyes treated with rapamycin by in gel delivery. shows a DIC image of a section from an eye injected with Matrigel and rapamycin mixture at a high dose 10 g l suspension 10 days before tissue collection to show rapamycin particles in the subretinal space. Rapamycin particles in Matrigel are clearly seen in the DIC image which is superimposed on a confocal image of Vessel Paint staining to show the choroidal and retinal blood vessels. No CNV was found in any eyes injected with rapamycin.

In all experiments rapamycin had no discernable effect on the normal vasculature of the eye. Cyclosporin also an immunosuppressant failed to inhibit CNV formation either when administrated orally 100 mg kg d n 3 or in gel 25 g l n 3 by the same experimental paradigm.

FK506 which is not water soluble was mixed with Matrigel as a suspension at 10 g l and 1.2 l were injected into the subretinal space as described above. Eyes were collected 10 days after injection and blood vessels were stained with Vessel Paint. Eyes were embedded in 5 agarose and serial sections were cut 100 m thick on a vibratome. CNV was examined by fluorescence microscopy and CNV index of each eye was calculated. Results are shown below.
