This is a continuation in part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 346 247 filed Jan. 9 2012 and titled Filtering Content Based on Acquiring Data Associated with Language Identification the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

This disclosure relates in general to providing filtered content to a user and more particularly to filtering content based on acquired data associated with language identification.

A wide array of content for viewing may be obtained through different technologies. Movies television shows educational videos etc. may be downloaded using personal computers laptop computers tablet slate devices smart phones and other Internet capable devices. Documents books articles and other texts may also be viewed or downloaded. Cable and satellite systems also provide access to many types of content such as television programs movies video on demand content pay per view content etc.

To discover content of interest to a user search engines program guides push services and other filtering technologies may be used. Without such tools the plethora of available content would be overwhelming. However even with such tools a user is often inundated with content that is in a language that the user lacks proficiency in reading and or understanding.

For example electronic program guides EPG and interactive program guides provide users of television radio and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying broadcast programming content or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming content. Non interactive electronic program guides EPG present a digitally displayed non interactive menu of programming content on a dedicated channel. EPGs are broadcast by specialized video character generation CG equipment housed within each such provider s central television distribution facility. By tuning into an EPG channel a menu is displayed that lists current and upcoming television programs on all available channels.

A more modern form of the EPG is the interactive program guide IPG . An IPG allows user to navigate scheduling information menus interactively selecting and discovering programming by time title station or genre using an input device such as a keypad computer keyboard or TV remote control. Its interactive menus are generated entirely within local receiving or display equipment using raw scheduling data sent by individual broadcast stations or centralized scheduling information providers. A typical IPG provides information covering the next 7 or 14 days.

Data to populate an interactive EPG may be distributed over the Internet either for a charge or free of charge and implemented on equipment connected directly or through a computer to the Internet. Television based IPGs can also facilitate the selection of programs for recording with digital video recorders DVRs also known as personal video recorders PVRs .

The aspect of an IPG most noticed by users is its graphical user interface GUI which is typically implemented as a grid or table listing channel names and program titles and times Web and Television based IPG interfaces allow the user to highlight any given listing and call up additional information about it supplied by the EPG provider. IPGs also allow users the option of searching or filtering content by genre as well as immediate one touch access to or recording of a selected program. Reminders and parental control functions may also often be included. The IPGs may also be configured to control a DVR. However as can be seen current EPGs filter content based on a parameter selected by the user e.g. genre. Filter setup is performed manually by configuring the filters using the guide.

Other filtering tools such as search engines data mining tools social media filters etc. are also limited in how parameters are used to filter results. For example a search for a movie of a particular title may generate results that include an English version a Spanish version an English version having French subtitles a Spanish language book of the title an English language book of the title etc. Thus the user is forced to scan through the search results to identify results that the user is interested in viewing or downloading.

It can be seen then that there is a need for providing content filtering based on acquired data associated with language identification.

To overcome the limitations described above and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification embodiments for filtering content based on acquired data associated with language identification are disclosed.

Content is filtered based on acquiring data associated with language identification. Data is acquired from a plurality of sources.

A method for filtering content based on acquiring data associated with language identification is disclosed. The method includes acquiring data associated with language identification and filtering content based on a preferred language identified using the acquired data.

In another embodiment a system for filtering content based on acquiring data associated with language identification is disclosed. The system includes a language preference model for acquiring data associated with language identification and processing the acquired data to identify a preferred language and a recommendation engine receiving the identified preferred language from the language preference model and filtering content based on the identified preferred language.

In another embodiment a computer readable storage medium that includes instructions that when executed filters content based on acquiring data associated with language identification is disclosed. The instructions include acquiring data associated with language identification and filtering content based on a preferred language identified using the acquired data.

These and various other advantages and features of novelty are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However for a better understanding of the disclosed embodiments the advantages and the objects obtained reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof and to accompanying descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of the disclosed embodiments.

Embodiments are directed to filtering content based on acquired data associated with language identification. Data is acquired from a plurality of sources. A language preference model provides a recommendation of a preferred language and determines a source of the acquired data having a highest priority. The acquired data is stored in a user profile.

The CATV system is in the form of a distributed client server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network between server side services providers e.g. cable television services providers via a server side head end and a client side customer via a client side set top box STB functionally connected to a customer receiving device such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art modern CATV systems may provide a variety of services across the HFC network including traditional digital and analog video programming telephone services high speed Internet access video on demand and information services.

On the client side of the CATV system digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set via the set top box STB . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in the STB is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor memory and an input output mechanism. The input output mechanism receives input from server side processes via the HFC network and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device and the keyboard . The remote control device and the keyboard may communicate with the STB via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The remote control device may include a biometric input module . The STB also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set via a cable communication transport . A multi channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB and the server side head end system described below.

The STB also includes an operating system for directing the functions of the STB in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example if a client application requires a news flash from a third party news source to be displayed on the television the operating system may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB for example to output the news flash to the television at the direction of the client application responsible for displaying news items.

Because a variety of different operating systems may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set top boxes a middleware layer may be provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment the middleware layer may include a set of application programming interfaces APIs that are exposed to client applications and operating systems that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system for facilitating communication between the server side application server and the client side STB . The middleware layer of the server side application server and the middleware layer of the client side STB may format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language XML .

The set top box passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television via a one way communication transport . The STB may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system via the HFC network through a video data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system to the server side of the CATV system via the HFC network via one data uplink. The video data downlink is an in band downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system through the HFC network to the set top box for use by the STB and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art the in band signaling space operates at a relative high frequency e.g. between 54 and 860 megahertz. The signaling space is generally divided into channels in which may be transmitted as a single analog signal or a greater number e.g. ten of digital signals.

The data downlink and the data uplink illustrated in between the HFC network and the set top box comprise out of band data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art the out of band frequency range is generally at a lower frequency than in band signaling. For example the out of band frequency range may be between zero and 54 megahertz. Data flow between the client side set top box and the server side application server is typically passed through the out of band data links. Alternatively an in band data carousel may be positioned in an in band channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server side application server through the HFC network to the client side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system described with reference to is well known to those skilled in the art.

Referring still to the head end of the CATV system is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network to client side STBs for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above a number of services may be provided by the CATV system including digital and analog video programming interactive television services telephone services video on demand services targeted advertising and provision of information content.

The application server is a general purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client side set top box via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set top box the application server includes a middleware layer for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system for receipt and use by the client side set top box . For example the application server via the middleware layer may obtain data from third party services via the Internet for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network and the set top box . For example a weather report from a third party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server receives the downloaded weather report the middleware layer may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set top box .

According to one embodiment data obtained and managed by the middleware layer of the application server is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set top box through the HFC network where the XML formatted data may be utilized by a client application in concert with the middleware layer as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art a variety of third party services data including news data weather data sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server via distributed computing environments such as the Internet for provision to customers via the HFC network and the set top box .

According to embodiments the application server obtains customer support services data including billing data information on customer work order status answers to frequently asked questions services provider contact information and the like from data services for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in the services provider data services include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system which may include data on a given customer.

A billing system may include information such as a customer s name street address business identification number Social Security number credit history and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments the billing system may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.

A customer information database may include general information about customers such as place of employment business address business telephone number and demographic information such as age gender educational level and the like. The customer information database may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices departments. As should be understood this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider.

Referring still to web services system is illustrated between the application server and the data services . According to embodiments web services system serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . According to embodiments when the application server requires customer services data from one or more of the data services the application server passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is the application server is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems nor is the application server required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server for ultimate processing via the middleware layer as described above.

A language recommendation engine is provided according to an embodiment to filter out content based on obtaining data associated with language identification such as from a setting indicating a language or based on behavior of a user or a user device such as STB remote control device keyboard or other computing device such as a tablet slate computer smart phone etc. STB provides a filter interface for presenting filtered programming content via STB on the TV . While the filter interface may be implemented using STBs the person having ordinary skills in the art will understand that the filter interface may be provided through wireless device any type of network media device or any device capable of interfacing with a STB or in a server or other module on the head end side . Such devices may include DVRs wireless phones PCs laptop computers tablet slate computers media viewing devices or equivalents thereof. Further filter interface may be provided through a STB. A translator may be accessed by the filter interface for providing translations for example using a language identified as most often used.

An authentication system may include information such as secure user names subscriber profiles subscriber IDs and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services. As should be understood by those skilled in the art the disparate systems may be integrated or provided in any combination of separate systems wherein shows only one example.

Referring to as an example a recommendation engine that includes a language preference model uses data associated with language identification that is obtained from a user device or derived from behavior of the user device . For example the data associated with language identification may be obtained from a setting on the device indicating a language or may be based on capturing the user s behavior of the user device . The language preference model may be a mathematical model for determining a preferred language that may be used to filter content to provide content associated with a determined preferred language e.g. movies in a certain language or having subtitles in a certain language etc. Data associated with language identification such as from a setting indicating a language or based on behavior of a user or a user device is obtained and content is filtered based on the obtained data associated with language identification. For example content may be filtered based on the language choice of the keyboard of the device based on the language that is mostly used on the device the language chosen of the guide or certain behavior on the device such as closed captioning or subtitling programs viewed the most. Also a user may filter content based on a desired language by manually selecting a preferred language using a user interface see user interface in . The preferred language setting may be associated with one device or could be extended to all registered devices. For example if the keyboard language is Spanish content may be filtered so that only Spanish content is displayed to the user. The customer can disable this feature or enable it through a user interface .

Content may be filtered from an Electronic Program Guide EPG or from search result obtained while browsing the Internet looking for programming content video content . User interface may be used to expand to all content i.e. turn the language filtering off if the customer chooses. If the customer uses another language for search or viewing content e.g. by setting Secondary Audio Programming SAP using the user interface then content may be filtered based on the selected SAP. If the customer chooses SAP then the language to be displayed may be predicted using the language preference model and EPG content may be filtered based on the chosen language. For wireless device the invention may filter content based on the chosen language of a particular device when a user sets a language for the device .

Content may be filtered automatically to display programs based on the desired language of the device. If the customer owns more than one device but chooses the language for one of the device then content may be filtered across the multiple devices by maintaining a user profile database that includes an identification of device associated with a user. Additionally after finding the chosen language or the mostly used language across multiple devices or one device the recommendation engine uses the identified preferred language to recommend content based on the identified preferred language associated with a device associated with the user.

Content may be filtered based on the chosen language for subtitling a preferred language for closed captioning and or when certain language subtitles have been used. The language preference model predicts and adjusts automatically according to the language used by the user and through using a statistical model the content will be sorted out based the language mostly used less used etc. However the preferred language may be selected manually through the user interface .

Other filters may also be applied using the same mechanism. For example if a customer will be watching football in 2 weeks all football games may be filtered on the EPG and presented to the user when navigating the EPG. The user may also simply view a listing of filtered programs. The language preference model may use a statistical method or a linear prediction for the more complicated options. In addition linear prediction may also be provided based on the identified preferred language.

Once data associated with language identification is obtained a language recommendation engine generates a recommended language . For example a mathematical model may be applied to the data to provide a recommendation of a preferred language. In addition business rules may be used to decide which block has the highest priority. A statistical or prediction algorithm may be used to decide which block has the highest priority. Gaming theory may also be used to choose the block having the highest priority.

Next actions may be prioritized and an action having the highest priority may be chosen . This information may be stored in a user profile for interpolating from stored data and provided to a recommendation engine . The user profile may also be provided to sales personnel so that dynamic offers may be provided to customers . In addition the user profile may be used to provide targeted advertising .

A determination is made whether a preferred language is identified . If not 462 a manual setting may be used to filter content . When a preferred language is identified content is filtered based on the data obtained from a user device or derived form behavior of the user device . Dynamic changes may be made to the user interface based on the identification of a preferred language .
