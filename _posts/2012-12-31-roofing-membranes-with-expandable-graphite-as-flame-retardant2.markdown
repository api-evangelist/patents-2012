This application is the national stage application of International Application Serial No. PCT US2012 072309 filed Dec. 31 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 581 179 filed on Dec. 29 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to polymeric sheeting materials such as EPDM membranes for roofing applications that include expandable graphite as a flame retardant.

Ethylene propylene diene terpolymer EPDM is extensively used in a variety of applications. For example it is particularly useful as a polymeric sheeting material that because of its physical properties flexibility weathering resistance low temperature properties and heat aging resistance has gained acceptance as a roofing membrane for covering industrial and commercial roofs. These rubber roofing membranes are typically applied to the roof surface in a vulcanized or cured state and serve as an effective barrier to prevent the penetration of moisture to the covered roof.

These roofing membranes are typically prepared by compounding the base polymer of EPDM with appropriate fillers processing oils and other desired ingredients such as plasticizers antidegradants adhesive enhancing promoters etc. in a suitable mixer and calendering the resulting compound into the desired thickness. The roofing membrane may also be cured by vulcanizing the resultant sheet in the presence of one or more vulcanizing agents and or compatible vulcanizing accelerators.

Mineral fillers such as clay talc silicas mica calcium carbonate and the like are typically added to a roofing membrane formulation to increase burn resistivity such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 468 550.

Roofing membranes typically also include flame retardants FR . Decabromodiphenyl oxide DBDPO is a well known halogen containing FR used in EPDM roofing membranes. However DBDPO has become an environmental concern due to its high bromine content 83 wt . Due to these concerns and also to address regulatory changes in the industry there exists a need for DBDPO free polymeric compositions which also provide flame retardant properties.

There is an ongoing desire to find materials that are useful as flame retardants within rubber roofing membranes and that do not have a deleterious impact on the rubber roofing membranes.

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a roofing membrane comprising at least one layer of a cured rubber and expandable graphite dispersed within the cured rubber.

Embodiments of the present invention are based upon the discovery of a rubber roofing membrane including expandable graphite as a flame retardant. Advantageously the membranes of one or more embodiments meet the performance standards as set forth in UL 94 and UL 790 even though the membranes are substantially devoid of halogen containing flame retardants. Practice of the present invention has been found to be particularly useful in rubber membranes such as EPDM membranes and these membranes advantageously meet the performance standards of ASTM D 4637.

In one or more embodiments the membranes of the present invention include cured rubber expandable graphite a filler and an extender. Additionally these membranes which may be black or non black may include other constituents that are employed in rubber membranes or rubber compounds. The membranes include a cured network deriving from a vulcanizable rubber composition. The various other ingredients may be dispersed throughout the cured network. The membrane may also be referred to as a sheet. The membrane may further comprise fabric reinforcement. In certain embodiments the membranes are devoid of halogen containing flame retardants.

In one or more embodiments the EPDM membrane employed in practice of the present invention includes a cured sheet of ethylene propylene diene copolymer rubber EPDM . Dispersed within the crosslinked network of ethylene propylene diene copolymer may be various additives including but not limited to filler oil wax antioxidant antiozonant flame retardant and the like. The EPDM sheet may be a single ply sheet or a multi ply sheet. The EPDM sheet may be devoid of fabric reinforcement or it may include a fabric reinforcement positioned between two or more plies or layers of rubber.

In one or more embodiments the membranes although commonly referred to as single ply roofing membranes may include two or more layers that are compositionally distinct. The layers may be formed by calendering. For example first and second sheets may be formed from first and second respective rubber compositions and then the respective sheets can be mated and further calendered or laminated to one another optionally with a reinforcing fabric therebetween. The skilled person will recognize however that these layers may be integral to the extent that the calendering and or curing process creates an interface at some level and the layers are generally inseparable. Nonetheless reference can be made to the individual layers especially where the layers derive from distinct compositions. Reference may also be made a multi layered sheet.

In one or more embodiments each layer of a multi layered membrane or sheet may include expandable graphite according to the present invention. In other embodiments a first layer may include expandable graphite and a second is devoid or substantially devoid of expandable graphite. Substantially devoid refers to the absence of that amount of expandable graphite that would otherwise have an appreciable impact on practice of the present invention. For example in one embodiment the membrane of the invention is a calendered sheet wherein a first composition including expandable graphite is calendered to form a first layer of the membrane and a second composition that devoid or substantially devoid of expandable graphite is calendered to form a second layer of the membrane.

In one or more embodiments the membranes of the present invention are two layered membranes wherein the first membrane is black in color and the second layer is non black in color e.g. white or generally white . As those skilled in the art appreciate the black layer can derive from a black composition that would generally include carbon black as a filler. The black layer includes expandable graphite as contemplated by the present invention. The white layer can derive from a white composition that would generally include non black fillers such as silica titanium dioxide and or clay. White EPDM membranes or membranes having a white EPDM layer are known in the art as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 12 389 145 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Generally the thickness of the sheet ranges from about 20 to about 100 mils in other embodiments from about 35 to about 95 mils and in other embodiments from about 45 to about 90 mils. In one or more embodiments the EPDM sheet meets the performance standards of ASTM D4637.

The roofing membrane of the present invention can be prepared by conventional means using conventional rubber compounding equipment such as Brabender Banbury Sigma blade mixer two roll mill or other mixers suitable for forming viscous relatively uniform admixtures. Mixing techniques depend on a variety of factors such as the specific types of polymers used and the fillers processing oils waxes and other ingredients used. In one or more embodiments the ingredients can be added together in a single shot. In other embodiments some of the ingredients such as fillers oils etc. can first be loaded followed by the polymer. In other embodiments a more conventional manner can be employed where the polymer added first followed by the other ingredients.

Mixing cycles generally range from about 2 to 6 minutes. In certain embodiments an incremental procedure can be used whereby the base polymer and part of the fillers are added first with little or no process oil the remaining fillers and process oil are added in additional increments. In other embodiments part of the EPDM can be added on top of the fillers plasticizers etc. This procedure can be further modified by withholding part of the process oil and then adding it later. In one or more embodiments two stage mixing can be employed.

The sulfur cure package sulfur accelerator can be added near the end of the mixing cycle and at lower temperatures to prevent premature crosslinking of the EPDM polymer chains. When utilizing a type B Banbury internal mixer the dry or powdery materials such as the carbon black and non black mineral fillers i.e. untreated clay treated clays talc mica and the like can be added first followed by the liquid process oil and finally the polymer this type of mixing can be referred to as an upside down mixing technique .

Once mixed the rubber composition can then be formed into a sheet via calendering. The compositions of the invention can also be formed into various types of articles using other techniques such as extrusion.

The resultant rubbery compositions may be prepared in sheet form in any known manner such as by calendering or extrusion. The sheet may also be cut to a desired dimension. In one or more embodiments the resulting admixture can be sheeted to thicknesses ranging from 5 to 200 mils in other embodiments from 35 to 90 mils by using conventional sheeting methods for example milling calendering or extrusion. In one or more embodiments the admixture is sheeted to at least 40 mils 0.040 inches which is the minimum thickness specified in manufacturing standards established by the Roofing Council of the Rubber Manufacturers Association RMA for non reinforced EPDM rubber sheets for use in roofing applications. In other embodiments the admixture is sheeted to a thickness of about 45 mils which is the thickness for a large percentage of single ply roofing membranes used commercially. The sheeting can be visually inspected and cut to the desired length and width dimensions after curing.

The calendered sheeting itself should show good uniform release from the upper and lower calendar rolls and have a smooth surface appearance substantially free of bubbles voids fish eyes tear drops etc. . It should also have uniform release from the suction vacuum caps at the splicing table and uniform surface dusting at the dust box.

The membranes of the present invention can be optionally reinforced with scrim. In other embodiments the membranes are devoid of scrim.

The roof sheeting membranes can be evaluated for physical properties using test methods developed for mechanical rubber goods. Typical properties include among others tensile strength modulus ultimate elongation tear resistance ozone resistance water absorption burn resistivity and cured compound hardness.

In one or more embodiments the membranes of the invention demonstrate burn resistivity that meets or exceeds standards of flame spread such as tested by UL 94 and or UL 790. Further the membranes of the invention meet standards of resistance to wind uplift as tested in accordance with test method UL 1897. In these or other embodiments the membranes of the present invention meet the performance standards of ASTM D 4637.

The membranes of this invention may be unrolled over a roof substructure in a conventional fashion wherein the seams of adjacent sheets are overlapped and mated by using for example an adhesive. The width of the seam can vary depending on the requirements specified by the architect building contractor or roofing contractor and they thus do not constitute a limitation of the present invention. Seams can be joined with conventional adhesives such as for instance a butyl based lap splice adhesive which is commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company as SA 1065. Application can be facilitated by spray brush swab or other means known in the art. Also field seams can be formed by using tape and companion primer such as QuickSeam tape and Quick Prime Plus primer both of which are commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company of Carmel Ind.

Also as is known in the art these membranes can be secured to the roof substructure by using for example mechanical fasteners adhesives which are often employed to prepare a fully adhered roofing system or ballasting.

Four non black rubber formulations were prepared and tested for processing properties. Each rubber formulation included EPDM polymer together with the following ingredients which amounts are based upon 100 parts by weight of the rubber about 51 parts by weight pbw silica about 58 pbw titanium dioxide about 59 pbw oil about 2 pbw hydrocarbon wax about 5 pbw polyethylene wax about 5 pbw zinc oxide about 3.25 pbw stearic acid about 2 pbw silane coupling agent about 1.5 pbw sulfur about 1.5 pbw of a dithiocarbamate accelerator and about 0.3 pbw of a thiazole accelerator as well as those additional ingredients provided in Table I the ingredients are provided in parts by weight . The formulations were mixed by employing a two step mixing procedure wherein the curative accelerators and a portion of the stearic acid were added in a second low temperature mixing step.

Expandable Graphite I was obtained under the tradename Asbury 1721 graphite Asbury Carbons and was characterized by a particle size nominal size U.S. Sieve of 20 50 corresponding to particles having a nominal size greater than 300 m a pH of about 1 to about 6 an expansion ratio of 290 to 1 cc g and an on set expansion temperature of about 200 C. Expandable Graphite II was obtained under the tradename Asbury 3772 graphite Asbury Carbons and was characterized by a particle size nominal size U.S. Sieve of 20 50 corresponding to particles having a nominal size greater than 300 m a pH of about 5 to about 10 an expansion ratio of 290 to 1 cc g and an on set expansion temperature of about 200 C. Expandable Graphite III was obtained under the tradename Asbury 3626 graphite Asbury Carbons and was characterized by a particle size nominal size U.S. Sieve of 60 200 corresponding to particles having a nominal size greater than 75 m a pH of about 5 to about 10 an expansion ratio of 150 to 1 cc g and an on set expansion temperature of about 105 C.

The processing properties of each composition were evaluated within a Rubber Processing Analyzer set at 160 C. for 45 minutes at 100 cycles per minute and 0.5 deg. The analyzer was set to mimic a moving dirheometer MDR at 1.1. The results of the test data are provided in Table I.

Twelve additional non black EPDM samples were prepared in a similar fashion to those samples provided in Table I. These samples were cured into test specimens for mechanical testing according to ASTM D 412 puncture testing according to ASTM D 4833 die C tear testing as well as cured 6 6 samples for burn resistivity testing. Specifically the burn resistivity testing included stapling the rubber sample to a half inch ISO board on a sample holder that places the membrane and ISO board at a 45 degree angle to the ground. A propane torch with a two inch flame is positioned such that the flame contacts the end of the membrane. The flame is applied for two minutes and care is taken so that the flame does not contact the ISO board. The burn resistivity of the membrane was visually observed and ranked in numerical fashion from 1 to 5 with 5 representing those membranes providing the best burn resistivity. The ability of the membrane to self extinguish was also determined by visual inspection and the self extinguishing nature of the membrane is recorded in Table II.

The relevant ingredients employed in each sample together with the results of the testing are provided in Table II.

Five black EPDM samples were prepared and tested for physical properties as well as burn resistivity and self extinguishing properties. Each formulation included EPDM polymer and the following ingredients based upon 100 parts by weight pbw of the rubber 117 pbw carbon black 45 pbw talc 67 pbw oil 5 pbw zinc oxide 2 pbw stearic acid 1.3 pbw sulfur 0.2 pbw of a thiuram accelerator and 3.6 pbw of a benzothiazole sulfenamide accelerator as well as those additional ingredients provided in Table III. The formulation was mixed by using a two step mixing procedure where the curative and accelerators were mixed in a low temperature mixing stage. The results of the physical testing and burn resistivity testing are provided in Table III.
