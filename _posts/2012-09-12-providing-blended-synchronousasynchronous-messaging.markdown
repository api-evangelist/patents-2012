title: Providing blended synchronous/asynchronous messaging
abstract: A system for blending synchronous and asynchronous computer communication applications that determines when a user of a synchronous communication application, such as an instant messaging application, attempts to send a message to another user that is unavailable for synchronous communications, and that forwards the message from the synchronous communication application to an asynchronous communication application for delivery. The forwarded message may be an email message, and the system may operate to determine a destination electronic mail address of the destination user for inclusion in the forwarded message, and include an indication in the forwarded message that it has been forwarded from the synchronous communication application. This indication enables the asynchronous communication application to perform special processing with regard to the forwarded message.

The present application is a Continuation application under 35 U.S.C. 120 of commonly owned prior application Ser. No. 11 141 172 filed on May 31 2005 in the names of Michael R. O Brien et al. now allowed all disclosures of which are hereby included by reference herein.

The present invention relates generally to electronic communication systems and more specifically to a method and system for providing blended synchronous and asynchronous electronic communications between computer system users.

In modern computer systems communication between users is provided through a variety of software applications. Two of the most popular are instant messaging and electronic mail email . As it is generally known instant messaging systems are an example of what are referred to as synchronous communication systems. In synchronous communication systems communication is possible only between users that are simultaneously online. Electronic mail is an example of what are referred to as asynchronous communication systems in which messages can be sent from a sending user to a receiving user regardless of whether both users are currently online. When an email message is sent to a user that is currently unavailable for synchronous communications the email software receives the message on behalf of the user and stores it for later retrieval. When the unavailable user subsequently goes online he or she can retrieve the stored message by accessing it from an Inbox data structure or the like.

A problem may arise when a user of a synchronous communication system tries to communicate with another user that is either not currently online or has indicated to their communication software that they are not to be disturbed by synchronous messages. In existing systems such a situation may prevent the user wishing to send the message from sending the message using their current or preferred synchronous communication application. Moreover if a synchronous communication system user begins entering a lengthy message for another user who is initially online but then subsequently becomes disconnected before the message is completely entered and sent the entered message may not be deliverable using the synchronous communication system. Under these circumstances the sending user may have to completely re enter the message into the synchronous communication application later when the other user is online. Alternatively the sending user may have to cut or otherwise extract the entered message from the synchronous communication system and then paste it into a message entry interface of a separate asynchronous communication application such as an email application. While some existing synchronous messaging systems provide a notification indicating when the other goes online the user attempting to send the synchronous message may themselves not be online at that later time. These problems are increasing significant in view of the growing popularity of instant messaging services such as AOL s Instant Messenger AIM AOL s ICQ Microsoft s MSN Messenger Windows Messenger and Yahoo Messenger and others such as Cerulean Studio s Trillian which is a single instant messaging program that works with all of these services as well as the Internet s traditional IRC Internet Relay Chat chat rooms.

For the above reasons and others it would be desirable to have a new communication system that blends features of synchronous and asynchronous communication systems to allow online users to more conveniently communicate with offline users without having to manually switch between multiple independent application programs and or having to re enter or move message content from a synchronous communication system message interface to a message entry interface of an asynchronous communication system.

To address the above described and other shortcomings of prior solutions a new method and system for blending synchronous and asynchronous computer communication applications is disclosed. In the disclosed system when a user of a synchronous communication application such as an instant messaging application attempts to send a message to another user that is unavailable for synchronous communications the disclosed system forwards the message from the synchronous communication application to an asynchronous communication application for delivery to the other user. The asynchronous communication system may for example be an electronic mail email application or the like and the forwarded message may similarly be an email message or other appropriate message type. A user may be considered unavailable for synchronous communications if that user is currently offline is away from their computer or has indicated to the synchronous communication application that they are currently unavailable.

In order to forward the message entered into the synchronous communication application to the asynchronous communication application the disclosed system may operate to determine a destination address of the destination user that is understood by the asynchronous communication application such as an email address. Such a determination may require maintenance of and reference to a mapping between user names understood by the synchronous communication application and the asynchronous communication application.

The message forwarded from the synchronous communication application to the asynchronous communication application may be provided with an indication that the message has been forwarded from the synchronous communication application. This indication is provided so that the asynchronous communication application can perform special processing when the receiving user retrieves it from an Inbox data structure or the like. This special processing may include automatically determining whether the sending user is currently available for synchronous communications using the synchronous communication application. In the event that the sending user is currently available for synchronous communications the asynchronous communication application may operate to automatically initiate a synchronous communication session between the receiving user and the sending user in response to the receiving user retrieving the forwarded message from the asynchronous communication application. Alternatively in response to the receiving user retrieving the forwarded message the asynchronous communication application may provide a button or other user interface option allowing the receiving user to initiate a synchronous communication session with the sending user. If the sending user is not currently available for synchronous communications the receiving user is provided with the option of responding to the forwarded message using the asynchronous communication application.

Thus there is disclosed a new communication system that blends features of synchronous and asynchronous communication systems to allow online users to more conveniently communicate with offline users without having to manually switch between multiple independent application programs and or having to re enter or move message content from a synchronous communication system message interface to a message entry interface of an asynchronous communication system.

As shown in an illustrative embodiment of the disclosed system operates using a number of software components executing on a number of client computer systems shown for purposes of illustration as the client computer systems and and potentially also on a number of server computer systems shown for purposes of illustration as server computer system s . The client computer systems and and server computer system s may for example each include at least one processor program storage such as memory for storing program code executable on the processor and one or more input output devices and or interfaces such as data communication and or peripheral devices and or interfaces. The client computer systems and and server computer system are communicably connected by a data communication network such as a Local Area Network LAN the Internet or the like which may also be connected to a number of other client and or server computer systems. The client computer systems and and server computer system s may further include appropriate operating system software.

The embodiment of the disclosed system shown in facilitates communication between a user of a client computer system shown as user and another user of a another client computer system shown as user . User may be provided with an asynchronous communication application user interface as well as a synchronous communication application user interface . The asynchronous communication application user interface and synchronous communication application user interface are provided by asynchronous communication application client software and synchronous communication application client software . Communication application blending client software is also shown executing on the client computer system .

User may similarly be provided with an asynchronous communication application user interface and synchronous communication application user interface provided respectively by an asynchronous communication application client and a synchronous communication application client . Communication application blending client software is also shown executing on the client computer system .

A server computer system s is also shown in executing synchronous communication application server software asynchronous communication application server and communication application blending server software .

The synchronous communication application components and of may for example be components of an instant messaging service. The instant messaging service may be of any specific type including those based on proprietary or non proprietary protocols and operates by exchanging messages in real time between users. The instant messaging service requires that parties be logged onto the instant messaging service and therefore considered to be online at the same time for messages to be exchanged. The asynchronous communication application components and may for example be components of an electronic mail email application. The email application may be of any specific type and operates by accepting and storing messages on behalf of recipient users regardless of whether they are logged in or online for later retrieval. For example the asynchronous communication application clients an may operate to pull messages for the respective users and from the asynchronous communication application server .

A messaging system providing store and forward capability such as the Internet s Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP may be used by or contained partly or wholly within the asynchronous communication application components and . The asynchronous communication application clients and and synchronous communication application components and may for example consist of specific individual client programs or may consist of separate application services provided through a Web browser program or through an integrated application platform executing on the client computer systems and . The various software components of may be designed and or configured to exchange data or messages with each other through various application programming interfaces APIs .

During operation of the components shown in user attempts to send a message to user by entering the message into the synchronous communication application user interface . However prior to the message being delivered to user through the synchronous communication application user interface user becomes unavailable for receiving such synchronous messages. For example user may have become unavailable because they have logged off from an instant messaging service because they have indicated that they should not be disturbed by instant messages or for some other reason. The disclosed system detects that user has become unavailable for receiving synchronous messages and operates to forward the message entered into the synchronous communication application user interface to user through the asynchronous communication application. For example the communication application blending server and or communication application blending client may detect that user is unavailable for synchronous messages and that user has attempted to send user a synchronous messages for example from user availability information in the synchronous communication application server and or synchronous communication application client . In response the communication application blending client and or communication application blending server forms an email message that is sent to an email destination address associated with user .

The application blending client and or communication application blending server may determine an email address of user in a variety of ways. For example a directory or database including instant messaging screen names or handles recognized by the synchronous communication application components and as well as corresponding email addresses recognized by the asynchronous communication application components and may be stored in the server computer system s and accessible to the communication application blending server software . In such an embodiment the communication application blending server software operates to look up the email address of user based on an instant messaging handle associated with user . If both user and user are users of a corporate network such information may be extracted from a corporation wide centrally managed employee contact information directory. If it is determined that the synchronous communication application handle and email address for user are the same for example in a system in which all synchronous communication application handles and email addresses are the same then no separate lookup is required to determine the email address.

The email message sent to user includes the contents of the message entered by user into the synchronous communication application user interface and may also include an indication such as a flag or special code contained within a header field or body of the email message that the email message includes a forwarded synchronous communication application message. The email message sent to user may further include the synchronous communication application handle of user an email address of user and a chat history reflecting previous communications between user and user performed using the synchronous communication application components and . Once the email message is formed it can be sent to user for example through an SMTP software component accessible to or contained by either the communication application blending client or the communication application blending server . The asynchronous communication application server receives the email message on behalf of the user .

The email message is subsequently passed to the client computer system for example in an Inbox structure of the asynchronous communication application client and presented to user through the asynchronous communication application user interface . The disclosed system performs special processing of the email message in response to the indication contained in the email message that it contains a forwarded synchronous communication application message. Such special processing may include automatically detecting the email message in the Inbox for user for example by an agent process within the communication application blending client and attempting to form a synchronous communication application session or chat session between user and user in response to such detection. Such a synchronous communication application session would be successfully formed if at the time the email message containing the forwarded synchronous communication application message is detected in the Inbox for user both user and user are available for receiving. synchronous communication application messages. Moreover user may further be provided with an initial option of expressly declining or accepting the synchronous communication application session with user through either the asynchronous communication application user interface or the synchronous communication application user interface . User may alternatively reply to the email message by sending another email message back to user through the asynchronous communication application components and . In the event that a synchronous communication application session is formed between user and user it may initially be set up to include the chat history between user and user contained in the email message also containing the forwarded synchronous communication application message.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that while the embodiment of is based on a client server model implementation in which the functions of the disclosed system are distributed across client and server computer platforms the present invention is not so limited. Accordingly the disclosed system may alternatively be embodied using various other architectural approaches such that the functions of the disclosed system are provided completely within software executing on or within a client or server platform on a peer system within a peer to peer network within the synchronous communication application and or asynchronous communication application or in some other functional distribution or configuration.

During operation of the disclosed system a local user associated with the handle Fred enters a message into the message window to be included in a chat session with another user identified by the handle Joe in the recipient field . When the local user hits carriage return or clicks on the send button the message is sent to Joe. A chat history of previous messages between Fred and Joe is contained in the chat window .

The entries in the availability list indicate whether other users are currently available to receive instant messages. A user can indicate that they are currently not available to receive instant messages or the system may automatically detect when a user is off line or unavailable for some other reason. In the example of Joe is indicated to be available. Accordingly the local user Fred may have begun entering message while Joe was indicated as available to receive synchronous messages and eventually hit carriage return or clicked on the send button to cause message to be sent to Joe. Alternatively Fred may have entered message while Joe was indicated as unavailable for receiving synchronous messages. The present system may be embodied to allow the local user to initiate sending of the message even when the indicated recipient s status has changed to unavailable. In either case for purposes of explanation at some point in time Joe becomes unavailable to receive instant messages prior to delivery of message . The disclosed system may operate to provide a notification in the user interface at some point indicating that Joe is unavailable and that accordingly message cannot be delivered as an instant message but can be included in an email message forwarded to Joel. Such a notification may include a window having buttons display objects or the like allowing the local user to select or reject the option of sending message as an email message. Alternatively the disclosed system may simply detect that the local user has sent message at a time when Joe is unavailable and automatically forward message in an email message sent to an email address corresponding to the screen name Joe. The email message including message may further include the sender screen name Fred as well as the chat history .

If the user selects the button to initiate a synchronous communication session and the original sender is currently available for such a session a user interface such as that shown in may be generated. The synchronous communication session user interface may include a synchronous message as well as an associated chat history conveyed in the asynchronous message.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that while the user interface of is shown providing button display objects for a user to select either a synchronous or asynchronous response to the received asynchronous message the present invention is not limited to these specific mechanisms. Accordingly any other user interface mechanisms may alternatively or additionally be presented in this regard as appropriate for a given embodiment or configuration.

At step the disclosed system operates to detect that an asynchronous message has been forwarded to the second user that contains a forwarded asynchronous message. The detection at step may be in response to the second user retrieving the asynchronous message from an Inbox structure or in response to the automatic detection of the message within the Inbox structure by an agent process monitoring the Inbox for such messages. In response to the detection at step the disclosed system operates at step to enable the receiving second user to respond to the asynchronous message by either initiating a synchronous communication session with the first user or by sending an asynchronous message to the first user.

As shown in the partial screen shot of an Inbox user interface of an asynchronous communication application program such as an electronic mail application shows a number of unread messages that have not yet been selected for retrieval by a local user. The unread messages are shown including a number of forwarded synchronous messages . In one embodiment of the disclosed system a software agent operates to detect each of the forwarded synchronous messages and automatically determines whether the sender of each such message is currently available for establishment of a synchronous communication session. If the sender of such a message is currently available then a synchronous communication session such as a chat or instant messaging session is automatically established between the sender and the local user associated with the asynchronous communication application providing the user interface . The software process that operates to monitor the Inbox for the local user and to cause the establishment of the synchronous communication session s may for example include the communication application blending client or as shown in .

Those skilled in the art should readily appreciate that programs defining the functions of the present invention can be delivered to a computer in many forms including but not limited to a information permanently stored on non writable storage media e.g. read only memory devices within a computer such as ROM or CD ROM disks readable by a computer I O attachment b information alterably stored on writable storage media e.g. floppy disks and hard drives or c information conveyed to a computer through communication media for example using wireless baseband signaling or broadband signaling techniques including carrier wave signaling techniques such as over computer or telephone networks via a modem.

While the invention is described through the above exemplary embodiments it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that modification to and variation of the illustrated embodiments may be made without departing from the inventive concepts herein disclosed. Moreover while the preferred embodiments are described in connection with various illustrative program command structures one skilled in the art will recognize that they may be embodied using a variety of specific command structures.
