This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 344 434 filed on Dec. 12 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 266 202 which claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 275 182 filed on Nov. 20 2008 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 989 795 filed on Nov. 21 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention is related to development of Web sites and Web applications. More specifically the present invention relates to JavaScript proxies and meta proxies.

Prior to Rich Internet Applications traditional Web applications involved a client server architecture with all of the processing on the server side and the client side used to display the HTML web pages served by the server. Each time a user desired to view a new Web page a HTTP request was sent to the server and the requested Web page was served to the Web browser on the client side. Such a traditional system is shown in with a Web server on a server side receiving requests over the Internet from a Web browser on a client side.

Rich Internet Applications such as Ajax greatly improved on the traditional client server architecture by allowing the client machine to dynamically render and partially refresh web pages based on an initial set of instructions from the server user input and small amounts of subsequent data dynamically requested from the server. As shown in the client machine processes Ajax instructions to render a Web page for the user.

Early Web applications allowed a user s browser to send a request to a server. The server processed the request and responded to the browser with a Web page. When the user wanted to view a new page another request was sent to the server and the server responded to the browser with a new Web page. Such a process resulted in a waste of bandwidth since much of the Web contents in the first Web page were also contained in the second web page. The need to resend the same information led to a much slower user interface of a Web application than that of a native application.

An emerging technology called Ajax Asynchronous and JavaScript XML was developed for refreshing part of a page instead of refreshing the whole page on every interaction between the user and application. In an Ajax application when a user submits a form in a page a script program usually a JavaScript program resident on the Web browser receives the user s request and sends a XML Extended Markup Language HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol request to the Web server in background so as to retrieve only the needed Web contents instead of the whole page and perform corresponding processing to partly refresh the page when receiving a response from the Web server. In this way the application response time is shortened because the amount of data exchanged between the Web browser and the Web server is greatly reduced. And the processing time of the Web server is saved because much of the processing is performed at the client side.

Ajax is the use of dynamic HTML JavaScript and CSS to create dynamic and usually interactive Web sites and applications. A more detailed explanation of Ajax is set forth in Edmond Woychowsky Prentice Hall 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Application Programming Interface API is a collection of computer software code usually a set of class definitions that can perform a set of related complex tasks but has a limited set of controls that may be manipulated by other software code entities. The set of controls is deliberately limited for the sake of clarity and case of use so that programmers do not have to work with the detail contained within the given. API itself.

Document Object Model DOM Element is an object contained in a Document Object Model DOM . The term DOM is generally used to refer to the particular DOM held in the memory region being used by the Web browser. Such a DOM controls the Graphical Respondent Interface GRI or Graphical User Interface GUI . The DOM is generated according to the information that the Web browser reads from the HTML file and or from direct JavaScript software instructions. Generally there exists a unique DOM element for every unique HTML element. DOM elements are sometimes referred to as HTML DOM elements because the DOM element exists only because HTML code that was read by the Web browser listed some HTML element that had not previously existed and thereby caused the Web browser to create that DOM element. Often specific elements of the greater set of HTML DOM elements are identified by specifying an HTML DOM checkbox element or an HTML DOM text input element. A more detailed explanation of the document object model is set forth in Jeremy Keith friendsof 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

There are three types of JavaScript 1 Client side JavaScript 2 Server side JavaScript and 3 Core JavaScript. Client side JavaScript is generally an extended version of JavaScript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers. Server side JavaScript is an extended version of JavaScript that enables back end access to databases file systems and servers. Core JavaScript is the base JavaScript.

Core JavaScript includes the following objects array date math number and string. Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript have additional objects and functions that are specific to client side or server side functionality. Generally any JavaScript libraries .js files created in core JavaScript can be used on both the client and the server without changes. Client side JavaScript is composed of a Core JavaScript and additional objects such as document form frame and window. The objects in Client side JavaScript enable manipulation of HTML documents checking form fields submitting forms creating dynamic pages and the browser directing the browser to load other HTML pages display messages . Server side JavaScript is composed of Core JavaScript and additional objects and functions for accessing databases and file systems and sending email. Server side JavaScript enables Web developers to efficiently create database driven web applications. Server side JavaScript is generally used to create and customize server based applications by scripting the interaction between objects. Client side JavaScript may be served by any server but only displayed by JavaScript enabled browsers. Server side JavaScript must be served by a JavaScript enabled server but can be displayed by any browser.

However current technologies that operate Server side JavaScript fail to offer complete interactions which are the hallmark of rich web sites and applications. When a developer designates some code to run on the server and be callable from the client they are logically defining a web service or an RPC Remote Procedure Call entry point.

The Present Invention overcomes the obstacles of the prior art. The present invention realizes a RPC and by default also assumes that the only page from which this code should be called client side is the page that included that code server side. The present invention therefore automatically removes and stores the server side code and then injects into the client side page new JavaScript code with the same name the proxy code. The proxy code will accept on the client the same inputs as the original server side function it will package up the data and then remotely call the server which will verify that the call came from the same page it was defined in find or reconstitute the original code pass it the data and when that function completes the returned data if any is packaged up returned to the client and becomes the return value from the proxy code. All of this is done automatically with the present invention. Moreover the present invention architecture also allows the insertion of meta proxy code code that upon arrival on the client or upon other client side events will then create the necessary proxies. For example if a large library is callable from the client but may or may not actually get called the present invention simply emits a meta proxy to the client and does not store the entire library server side. Instead the meta proxy would listen for any invocation of the library on the client and when it detects that it will call the server which will return the set of proxies that need to dynamically be created on the client for full access to that library. The server can also load that library dynamically as it s needed either when the meta proxy first detects the call or when the proxy functions are invoked

One aspect of the present invention is a method for automatically generating proxies. The method includes providing a code operating on a server side and callable from a client side. The method also includes assuming a page of the code which is callable from the client side is a page which includes the code server side. The method further includes automatically removing and storing the server side code. The method further includes injecting into a client side page proxy code with a same name as the original code.

Another aspect of the present invention is a method for automatically generating meta proxies. The method includes providing a code operating on a server side and callable from a client side. The method also includes assuming a page of the code which is callable from the client side is a page which includes the code server side. The method further includes automatically removing and storing the server side code. The method further includes injecting into a client side page meta proxy code with a same name as the original code. The method further includes generating a plurality of proxies on the client side upon a client side event.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is a JavaScript server architecture which includes means for automatically processing an original code for a HTML page running on a server side and callable on a client side to remove and store the original code and a framework written in JavaScript. The framework includes means for generating a proxy code for the original code and means for injecting the proxy code into the HTML page.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method for automatically generating proxies for synchronous calls and asynchronous calls. The method includes providing a code operating on a server side and callable from a client side. The method also includes assuming a page of the code which is callable from the client side is a page which includes the code server side. The method further includes automatically removing and storing the server side code. The method further includes injecting into a client side page a first proxy code with a same name as the original code and a second proxy code with a different name.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method for automatically generating meta proxies for synchronous calls and asynchronous calls. The method includes providing a code operating on a server side and callable from a client side. The method also includes assuming a page of the code which is callable from the client side is a page which includes the code server side. The method further includes automatically removing and storing the server side code. The method further includes injecting into a client side page a first meta proxy code with a same name as the original code and a second meta proxy code with a different name. The method further includes generating a plurality of proxies on the client side upon a client side event.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is a JavaScript server architecture which includes means for automatically processing an original code for a HTML page running on a server side and callable synchronously and asynchronously on a client side to remove and store the original code and a framework written in JavaScript. The framework includes means for generating a first proxy code for the original code for synchronous calls and a second proxy code for asynchronous calls and means for injecting the first proxy code and the second proxy code into the HTML page.

To understand the differences between the server and browser sides it s important to keep in mind the page lifecycle. The page request from the browser is received by the Web server which fetches the appropriate HTML document either from the file system or perhaps from another handler such as PHP or Ruby or Java . The Web server Apache server then feeds the document to the script server of the present invention which begins to parse the HTML document and builds up the DOM tree. When the script server encounters tags the script server not only adds them to the DOM but may also execute them if they have a runat attribute that indicates they should run on the server. During the parsing and execution external content may also be fetched and loaded into the document via elements and Jaxer.load . . . for JavaScript code or via or for HTML content or via XMLHttpRequests for any content. After the DOM is fully loaded the onserverload event is fired. This is the server side equivalent of the onload event on the browser. The onserverload event is named differently so that a developer s code can react separately to onserverload and onload events. The script server post processes the DOM to carry out its built in logic and prepare the DOM for sending to the browser removing blocks meant only for the server replacing functions to be proxied with proxies saving as needed functions that should be available on callbacks . . . etc. Finally the DOM is serialized back to HTML and that HTML is streamed back via the Web server to the browser.

The resulting HTML page is sent back to the browser as the response to the browser s request. The browser begins to parse the HTML building up the DOM. When the browser encounters tags the browser not only adds them to the DOM but also executes them. External JavaScript code or any other content may also be loaded. The onload event fires. Of course the page is progressively rendered throughout much of this flow and also the user can interact with it.

Callbacks from the browser to server side functions are handled via XMLHttpRequests. When the script server receives such a request it creates a new empty document unless configured to use a different static document . The script server retrieves the saved functions that are needed to be made available during callbacks to this page. If a function called oncallback is found it is executed. This is usually used to create the environment needed during a callback if the saved functions are not enough. The callback function itself is executed. Finally the result of that execution is packaged and returned as the response to the XMLHttpRequest.

While a DOM is available during callback processing it is not serialized as HTML and returned as the response as it was during the regular non callback page processing flow. The DOM on script server and the DOM on the browser typically are not synchronized. Both are created from the same HTML source but they are often subject to processing by different JavaScript code and both come to life at different points in the page lifecycle the DOM on the script server exists temporarily when the page is processed by the script server and is eliminated after it s been serialized into the HTML sent to the browser the DOM in the browser is built on the browser from that HTML and is the DOM that s rendered to the user and with which the end user interacts.

While script server and the browser may well share some code e.g. when using runat both usually the JavaScript code designated to run on script server and interacting with the script server DOM is different than the code designated to run on the client. The latter exists e.g. as a tag in the script server DOM but is not executed in script server.

Remember that the only things sent to the browser at the end of page processing is what s actually in the DOM and what the script server of the present invention has added such as proxies clientData and injected scripts. For example if a developer added an expando property which is an in memory change to the DOM that will not get serialized it will not appear on the client side.

On the browser the div is present with an id of myDiv but without a userId property. For this same reason setting event handlers programatically rather than in the DOM will not translate to DOM changes and hence will not propagate to the browser. For example with a button 

A developer could add an onclick . . . attribute to the tag but this does not assist with adding the event handler programatically. The script server of the present invention provides Jaxer.setEvent domElement eventName handler function that does the right thing in the script server as well as on the browser. var btn document.getElementById myButton function sayHi alert hi sayHi.runat client Jaxer.setEvent btn onclick sayHi 

The function used as the event handler should be made available to the browser. When setEvent is executed on the server as above it results in the following change to the myButton element This is sent to the browser since it is a DOM change. If the function passed into setEvent has no name its body source is used as the value of the attribute var btn

Which is useful for short functions but is easier to pass in the code to execute as a string var btn 

Having briefly described the present invention the above and further objects features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As shown in a system of the invention generally includes a server side a client side and a network or preferably the Internet . The server side includes a web server a handler and a JavaScript server preferably having a server core and a server framework . The client side includes a Web browser has a client framework a client side JavaScript code and a rendering engine . The server framework accesses filesystems and databases as well as the Internet . A more detailed description of the abilities of the running JavaScript on the server side and client side is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 270 817 filed Nov. 13 2008 for A Web Server Based On The Same Paradigms As Web Clients which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In the system is shown during a callback operation. The callback begins at the client side JavaScript code with a callback request sent to the client framework . A HTTP GET request is transmitted over the Internet to the server side and received at the Web server . The HTTP GET request is sent to the server core which sends the HTTP GET request as a callback to the server framework . The server framework receives the callback deserializes performs the get functions invokes serializes and sends the response to the callback to the server core . The server core sends the response to the Web server which sends the response over the Internet to client framework on the Web browser .

In the system is shown during a normal process. The process begins with a HTTP GET request for a Web page sent over the Internet from the Web browser on the client side to the server side . The HTTP Request is sent to the handler server . The HTML Web page is then sent to the script server architecture . The server core of the script server architecture parses the HTML Web page to create a HTML DOM of the HTML Web page. The server core also parses and interprets the JavaScript of the HTML Web page. The server framework accesses databases and filesystems to respond to the Requests for the HTML Web page. The server framework also injects proxies to modify the HTML Web page. The server core serializes the DOM back to the HTML Web page and the web server transmits the HTML Web page to the client side where the Web browser renders the HTML Web page for display for a user. As shown in a Web server e.g. apache server receives a request from the client side. The request is sent to the handler server PHP Ruby or Java language . The handler server feeds the HTML document to script server core which begins to parse the HTML document thereby building the DOM tree for the HTML document on the server side. Events and callbacks are sent to the script server framework . The script server adds tags to the DOM and executes them if the has a runat attribute that indicates the should be run on the server. During the parsing and execution external content from filesystems databases and the like are fetched and loaded into the HTML document. After the DOM is loaded the onserverload event is fired from the script server framework . The script server architecture post processes the DOM to perform its built in logic and prepare the DOM for transmission to the client side. This post process includes removing block meant only for the server replacing function to be proxied with proxies saving functions that should be available as callbacks and the like. The DOM is serialized back to HTML and the HTML is streamed back via the web server to the browser. A more detailed explanation of event driven JavaScript architecture is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 273 539 filed on Nov. 18 2008 for a Flexible Event Driven JavaScript Server Architecture which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As shown in the present invention allows the server to execute the JavaScript functions that are set to runat server or runat both . These functions might call databases file systems communicate across network sockets or get session data. And since the server side engine has a HTML DOM just like the browser the HTML page can be manipulated through standard DOM APIs and your favorite Ajax libraries. The present invention also has session objects that can be used to persist data for users during a session or transaction. Any functions set to runat server are stripped from what gets sent to the browser . Specifically at 1 the page executes on the server and a resulting HTML page is sent to the browser . A more detailed description of the runat function is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 270 868 filed on Nov. 14 2008 for a System And Method For Tagging Code To Determine Where The Code Runs which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

After server sends the resulting HTML page to the browser at 2 the browser interprets the HTML page and executes the JavaScript within the HTML page. If JavaScript functions tagged to runat server proxy are included then the present invention automatically strips out the bodies of those functions and replaces the bodies with a new functions by the same name that know how to invoke the original function on the server using Ajax calls and return the result either synchronously or asynchronously. Ajax communications do not need to be written using the present invention. Any functions not tagged with a runat attribute or set to runat client or runat both are processed by the browser .

Any functions set to runat server proxy can now be called from the browser . The function is called as if it were running on the browser and the present invention automatically via XHR communications with the server marshals the parameters to the server where the function executes calling databases getting info from the session data etc. . . . and returns the result to the browser . The server proxy functions can be invoked either synchronously or asynchronously. At 3 the browser calls the server asynchronously for new information.

The server computer program of the present invention is pre configured for preferable use as a plug in to the APACHE 2.x web server. To provide standards compliant JavaScript and DOM capabilities server side the server computer program is built on the MOZILLA engine which is the same engine used in the popular FIREFOX browser. The server computer program of the present invention is layered into APACHE as an input and output filter for use to modify dynamic pages created by other languages such as PHP or Ruby.

The server computer program of the present invention is preferably a combination of C C Core code and a server side JavaScript Framework. The server core provides the JavaScript parser and runtime HTML parser and DOM engine and an event architecture that calls the server framework as the document is being processed on the server side . The server framework provides the logic for example deciding which code to run on the server side and which on the client side creating proxies on the client side for callable server side functions serializing and deserializing data and other related activities.

On the server side a developer s JavaScript environment is enhanced by the server framework which provides access to the database e.g. MySQL file system network the HTTP Request and Response data and the external server side platforms such as Java PHP and Ruby.

An example of code written by a developer and prior to processing by the present invention is set forth below.

Processing of the code by the present invention results in the code being formatted as set forth below 

As shown in a server computer contains server architecture . The server architecture includes the server core and the server framework . The server core includes a JavaScript parser . The server computer is preferably a conventional server computer available from IBM HP APPLE DELL and SUN.

As shown in a user computer contains a Web browser . The Web browser preferably includes the client framework client side JavaScript code and the rendering engine . The user computer is preferably a conventional user computer such as a PC available from HP DELL and GATEWAY or a MAC available from APPLE. The Web browser is preferably MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER NETSCAPE APPLE SAFARI MOZILLA FIREFOX or OPERA.

A general method of the present invention is shown in . At block a code operating on a server side is provided and callable from a client side. At block a page of the code which is callable from the client side is assumed to be a page which includes the code server side. At block the server side code is automatically removed and stored. At block proxy code with the same name as the original code is injected into the client side page. Alternatively at block a first proxy code with the same name as the original code and a second proxy code with a different name are injected into the client side page.

A more specific method of the present invention for automatically generating meta proxies is shown in . At block a code operating on a server side is provided and callable from a client side. At block a page of the code which is callable from the client side is assumed to be a page which includes the code server side. At block the server side code is automatically removed and stored. At block meta proxy code with the same name as the original code is injected into the client side page. Alternatively at block a first meta proxy code with the same name as the original code and a second meta proxy code with a different name are injected into the client side page. At block multiple proxies are generated on the client side upon a client side event.

A more specific method of the present invention is shown in . At block on the client side a proxy code with the same name as an original code accepts the same inputs as an original server side function. At block the data is packaged and the server is called. At block the server verifies that the call came from the same page as the proxy code was defined in. At block the server finds the original code or reconstitutes the original code. At block the data is passed to the original code and the function is completed. At block the return data if any is packaged. At block the packaged return data is returned to the client side where it becomes the return value from the proxy code.

Another specific method of the present invention is illustrated in . At block an HTML document starts life on the server either as a static HTML file read from disk or as a dynamic page generated by PHP Ruby Java etc. At block the server core receives the HTML document as an output post process filter from APACHE and starts to parse and execute the HTML document similar to a browser. The server core creates and populates the DOM executes the JavaScript code designated to run on the server side and continues until the entire HTML document is completed. At block the server framework modifies the DOM by generating proxies that automatically replace server side client callable functions. At block the new DOM is serialized as an HTML document on the server core and streamed out to the client side . At block the client side receives the HTML document and the processing continues recreating the DOM from HTML document and executing the remaining client side JavaScript. At block one of the client side proxy functions is called and its parameters are automatically serialized into JSON. A XML HTTP request is sent to the server to invoke the original function with the parameters. At block the server receives the XML HTTP request. The parameters are deserialized. The function to be invoked is restored and called with these parameters. The results and any exception are serialized back into JSON. At block the data is returned to the client side where it is deserialized and returned as the result of the proxy.

Server side functions can be declared to be proxied so they are callable from the client side. This is achieved by specifying a proxy property on the function object. The possible values for this property are true or false. This is only required for enabling the proxying of the function. By default in a block the functions are not proxied. Note that if a function is not proxied it isn t just that proxies are not inserted into the client to facilitate calling it it s actually marked as not callable on the server so hacking the client to try to call the function on the server will not work.

The following example illustrates one simple way of using the proxy options in a typical code scenario. Group all the server side code in one script block and explicitly designate a subset of function to be proxied. Then all client side code goes in a different script block where there isn t even the option of programmatically changing it by setting a different runat or proxy value . Of course those skilled in the pertinent art may choose different ways of organizing the code. Further for large amounts of code one has the option to extract the code into reusable external JavaScript files.

The  login.js file referenced in the example illustrated in the code below which contains some functions that explicitly override the runat server directive specified on the script tag used to load the file.

Below is an illustration of object inside an Aptana namespace to allow the proxy functions to be declared in a single group within JavaScript code.

This code is presented in such a way that it is executed by the server prior to DOM serialization. One can also use this code to remove the proxied functions by setting the value to null. Also Aptana.proxies is not a complete collection of the functions being proxied by the server it is just a convenient way to express the myFunc.proxy true syntax for multiple function references.

In another example code written by a Web developer prior to processing by script server architecture of the present invention is set forth below.

Then after processing by the script server architecture of present invention the code is as set forth below.
