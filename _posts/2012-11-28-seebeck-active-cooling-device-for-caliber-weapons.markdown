In particular, the cooling device employs a plurality of thermoelectric devices that convert the energy from the heat produced by the hot barrel during the operation to an electric current. The electric current powers a series of electric fans, which in turn, cool the barrel.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically this invention relates to an improved means of cooling the barrel of a weapon which offers the potential to reduce its weight to remove the need for a second barrel and to improve its barrel life. In particular the present invention uses a thermoelectric device to convert the energy from the heat produced by a hot barrel during operation to power a fan that cools the barrel.

The weight reduction of small arms weapons is a significant concern for a soldier. A significant portion of the weight of individual and crew served weapons is in the barrel of the weapon. Much of the additional weight is necessary not only to withstand the pressure of firing the cartridge but also as a heat sink to absorb the thermal energy of firing the weapon.

In fact machine guns typically have a removable secondary barrel for the purpose of replacing the barrel after firing for a short time in order to allow the primary barrel to cool. This additional barrel adds weight and complexity to the weapon.

What is therefore needed is a device for cooling the weapon barrel with significant weight reduction. In other terms it would be desirable to solve the cooling problem and to remove the redundant weight associated with the need for a second barrel. Furthermore since the barrel life is primarily a function of the barrel temperature barrels fired at lower temperatures last significantly longer. As a result it would be desirable to extend the life of the barrel by reducing its operation temperature. Prior to the advent of the present invention the need for such a cooling means has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and describes a barrel cooling device and method collectively referred to as the present device the present method or the present system . The present device captures the energy from the heat produced by a hot barrel during operation and converts the captured energy into electric power that energizes one or more thermoelectric fans to cool the barrel.

Barrel cooling typically occurs through natural convection of the airflow around the barrel. Generally forced air convection can result in significant improvement of cooling compared to natural convection. The barrel cooling device of the present device uses the heat of the barrel during firing as a means to cool the barrel.

The barrel cooling device uses a thermoelectric generator that is mounted to the barrel which produces electricity as the barrel heats up from firing. The generated electrical current drives a series of electric fans to cool the barrel.

The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a difference in temperature on opposite sides of semiconductors to produce electrical energy.

To this end when the thermoelectric device is placed on a hot barrel it uses the recaptured heat energy to power a series of thermoelectric fans. This effect accelerates the air cooling of the barrel. A cooler barrel increases the lifespan of the barrel and allows the weight of the barrel to be reduced because less material is required for a heat sink.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

While four thermoelectric fans are shown in it should be clear that a different number of thermoelectric fans and corresponding devices could be used. In addition while the present invention will be described in connection with the machine gun it should be clearly understood that the present invention may be used with other weapons and weapon systems including but not limited to rifles.

In one embodiment the thermoelectric fans include three thermoelectric fans that are generally equally spaced between the gas block and the chamber and a fourth thermoelectric fan that is located between the gas block and the front sight of the machine gun.

As used herein thermoelectric fans are electric fans that are powered by the thermoelectric effect. The thermoelectric effect is also referred to as the Seebeck effect and is used to generate electricity. Generally the thermoelectric effect encompasses three separately identified effects the Seebeck effect the Peltier effect and the Thomson effect.

In general a thermoelectric device includes one or a series of p type semiconductor elements and one or a series of n type semiconductor elements that are electrically connected. When the two dissimilar elements are subjected to different temperatures the Seebeck effect causes a voltage to be generated across the junctions between the p type and n type semiconductor elements.

While illustrates the electric fan as a bladed fan it should be clear that a bladeless fan or any other available and suitable electric fan might be used instead.

The thermoelectric device may be comprised of any available or suitable thermoelectric modules such as the HZ 2 thermoelectric modules from Hi Z Technology Inc. Quantum well and lead telluride modules or other available thermoelectric devices may be used.

The electric fan model PSD1204PBB1 A from SUNON or any other suitable or available electric fan may be used. The electric fan may for example be approximately 40 mm 40 mm 24 mm in dimensions and can produce approximately 21.6 CFM of airflow.

The wire may for example be nickel plated copper insulated with mica tape and a fiberglass jacket. It should be noted that other suitable conductors may alternatively be used.

When the thermoelectric device is placed in contact with the hot barrel it uses the recaptured heat energy to power the electric fan which will accelerate the air circulation within the cooling chamber to cool the barrel . This increases the lifespan of the barrel and has the potential to reduce the weight of the barrel because less material is required for a heat sink.

The electric fan provides the desired cooling effect to the barrel .

In summary the electric fan e.g. is automatically powered by the heat emanating from the barrel to cool the barrel . It should be understood that the other thermoelectric fans that form the cooling device operate similarly to the thermoelectric fan to respectively cool adjacent sections of the barrel . It should also be understood that the different thermoelectric fans are included here to illustrate several different potential fan configurations and that a single configuration may be used for all thermoelectric fans in the device.

Experimentally and with further reference to the thermoelectric devices provide sufficient power to a reasonable configuration of electric fans respectively. A computer simulation was done of a barrel firing 100 rounds per minute with four similar thermoelectric fans both ON and OFF. The fan configuration chosen was four fans over the barrel which would produce a total of about 85 CFM of airflow over the barrel .

Each one of the thermoelectric fans requires approximately 6 Watts of power at 12 Volts which can be achieved using 3 to 4 thermoelectric devices per electric fan.

With reference to it illustrates another preferred embodiment of the present invention and shows a thermoelectric cooling assembly to be mounted onto the machine gun barrel as explained earlier in connection with the thermoelectric cooling devices of . The cooling assembly includes at least one bladeless thermoelectric fan also referred to as Dyson fan .
