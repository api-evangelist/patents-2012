The present technology relates generally to data center management and more specifically to locating IT components in a data center using a virtual representation of the data center.

In some implementations a data center can provide computer processing and or storage resources. A data center can support performing one or more prescribed processing tasks. In some common applications for example a data center can be used to implement any kind of network accessible service such as an Email service search service etc. . In some common applications a data center can be used to implement storage backup and or archival functionality.

A data center can include various physical resources to support and provide e.g. computer processing and or storage. A data center can include IT components such as racks servers data storage devices disk drives networking equipment and uninterruptible power supplies UPSs . Data centers can include supporting resources such as HVAC units chillers cooling equipment generators and battery backup systems. In some cases the physical resources of a data center can be housed in an enclosure such as a room or building. For a large scale service a data center can require a large number of physical resources occupying one or more buildings.

There have been recent developments in mobile computing devices such as laptops smart phones and tablets. In particular mobile computing devices can provide a variety of functions such as a digital camera capable of functioning as an optical code scanner. Mobile computing devices can provide accelerometers GPS receivers and other sensors.

Optical code scanners can be used in applications that rely on optical codes such as bar codes Quick Response QR codes or other matrix codes to store information. Industries such as retail airline self service automotive parcel delivery pharmaceutical and healthcare use optical codes to provide inventory control customer identification item tracking and many other functions. Optical code scanners scan or read an optical code that is typically attached to or printed on an object. A typical optical code is comprised of a number of bars or modules. Information is encoded in an optical code by the arrangement of bars or modules. When an optical code is placed within the field of view of a scanner the scanner can read the bars or modules comprising the optical code and then use this data to decode the information encoded in the optical code. This operation is called decoding an optical code. The information produced by decoding an optical code can take the form of an alphanumeric string numeric string or binary string.
