The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to improving accuracy in targeting of short range munitions. In particular the invention relates to guiding mortar projectiles for improved down range accuracy.

Presently mortars are unguided which results in large dispersions. Examples have been given in the public literature that two 120 mm mortar system mortars may land more than a kilometer from each other at a range of seven kilometers 7 km . See e.g. Trohanowsky R. 120 mm Mortar System Accuracy Analysis 17 May 2005.

Operations in urban environments require accuracies adequate to enable individual rooms in structures to be targeted. An example might be an enemy sniper operating from a building. The sniper is limited to the use of direct fire and the ability to target the sniper with indirect fire lessens the risk to friendlies and improves unit maneuverability in urban environments.

Conventional guidance methods yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular unguided short range ballistic projectiles such as mortars yield down range errors that may be unacceptable for some mission scenarios.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a method for guiding a projectile fired longitudinally from a launcher along a ballistic trajectory including providing a laser emitter and an optical sensor on the launcher directed longitudinally the emitter transmitting a longitudinally directed laser beam providing a laser reflector on an aft facing surface of the projectile to reflect said laser beam as a reflected signal and guiding the projectile by adjusting control fin position to minimize yaw and pitch moments. These techniques enable a mortar projectile to be guided for improved down range accuracy to the target.

More particularly the method provides for guiding a projectile fired longitudinally from a launcher along a ballistic trajectory. The method includes providing a first inertial navigation system INS a laser emitter and optical sensor on the launcher providing a second INS and a laser reflector on the projectile and presetting the second INS to an initial reference position prior to firing the projectile. Subsequent to launch the method further includes emitting a longitudinally directed laser beam from the emitter to the reflector receiving the reflected signal to the optical sensor establishing a position and velocity of the projectile based on the reflected signal transmitting a correction signal to the projectile from the launcher resetting the second INS at a position prior to reaching maximum altitude and guiding the projectile along the trajectory by adjusting control fin orientation.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a method to improve the accuracy of short range munitions such as mortars to allow use in urban environments. The acceleration of gun or mortar launch causes an inertial navigation system INS to saturate during the launch and a continuous navigation solution is not available from a pre launch initialization. After launch the INS solution no longer maintains validity.

The issue of increased accuracy has been addressed for longer range munitions by the addition of Global Positioning System GPS satellites and micro electromechanical systems MEMS based INS. For guided missiles its INS is typically initialized by the INS of the carrier vehicle prior to launch and the missile s INS is able to track motion throughout the flight for an accurate navigation solution.

Longer range munitions have sufficient time to acquire a GPS signal and use this to recalibrate their INS. The calibration of the attitude angles of the INS solution requires 10 to 30 seconds 10 30 sec beyond the initial acquisition of the GPS signal. For mortars this timeline is unacceptable because the maximum time of flight is typically less than 40 seconds at maximum range.

Beyond the short timeline issue associated with the necessity to recalibrate the INS by GPS another issue associated with mortar operations renders GPS calibration of the INS problematic in particular the relative altitude of the mortar trajectory as compared to artillery launched munitions such as the 155 mm M1 Long Tom field gun with about an order of magnitude longer range than the 60 mm M2 smoothbore mortar both used in the Second World War.

At high altitudes avoidance of ground based jamming can be readily accomplished by the use of body shielding and GPS antenna gain pattern shaping to reject any signals from the ground. But at low altitudes associated with mortar trajectories the line of sight angles from GPS jammers located on tall buildings to the vehicles places the jammers close to the horizon angle for the vehicle. Thus building an antenna system to reject GPS jammers for the mortar in the urban environment can be difficult.

The GPS calibration of the INS for mortars presents a number of problems that render that technique untenable for adjusting trajectory to minimize target error. Conventionally an alternative is to use an INS only system. In this approach the INS is reset to a pre launch value after exit from the tube based on the desired range to the target which sets the charges used and the barrel angle. Gun launch survivable INS designs using MEMS have made great strides in the past decade to reduce drift rates and bias errors that often drive free inertial navigation errors. A free inertial system can correct for the errors associated with metrological unknowns that increase the dispersions of unguided round. However the absence of feedback restricts ability to improve accuracy from other factors.

Because setting the velocity of the round must be based on pre launch estimates the dispersions are dominated by the uncertainty in the performance of the launch charges and the resulting velocity of the mortar. The tabular list in includes a set of dispersions associated with a generic mortar system. The velocity errors are obtained from Trohanowsky. The remainder of the variations is taken either from Trohanowsky or from LeFevre V. C. et al. MEMS IMU Common Guidance 4028 Apr. 2005.

As can be observed the majority of the miss distance is caused by the uncertainty in the achieved velocity of the round due to the round to round variation of charges. Current propellant technology limits the minimization of the round to round one standard deviation variation to about two meters per second 2 m s from Trohanowsky. The exemplary method embodiments provide a direct measurement of the achieved speed at the exit from the barrel that is used to calibrate the INS after launch and to reduce the errors.

Root Mean Square RSS Analysis of Miss As review upon identification of all the major sources of error the overall effect can be evaluated statistically by taking the RSS of all the Component Errors square root over where called sigma represents the standard deviation of the system characteristic of being evaluated and u represents sensitivity.

Sigma can represent precision error the bias error or a combination of both. In this example sans subscript represents the total system error in range. For components i error represents the standard deviation of each individual source of error. For example test data may show that the muzzle velocity for a given lot of ammunition has a standard deviation of 2.5 m sec in which case velocity error 2.5 m sec.

The parameter urepresents sensitivity of to . This sensitivity value represents how much is affected by a unit change in . For example if a variation of 1 m sec in muzzle velocity can affect range by 14.4 m then sensitivity u 14.4 m m sec . These values are also referred to as a unit effects or partial effects. The cross product of u represents the component error or the effect that each individual source of error has on the total system error.

A comparison of error sources can be shown to identify source contributions for reduction. as a tabular list with an error source in the left column and standard deviation in the right column. In particular the list of source contributions including muzzle velocity environmental conditions and orientation . A list of standard deviations shows the relative differences in spread that produce inaccuracies in aim. The largest contributors include muzzle velocity and range wind.

Various exemplary embodiments provide for resetting the INS after launch by the use of ground position velocity and attitude measured directly after launch instead of pre set values. shows an equipment configuration featuring a laser emitter equipped with an optical sensor and mounted in a precisely known alignment on the mortar launcher . The laser emitter transmits a coherent photon beam continuous or pulse to the mortar round or projectile . The beam is directed at a retro reflector on the projectile . shows a detail view of the projectile . In particular the beam illuminates a conical zone that aims at the retro reflector mounted at the projectile s aft end that may be equipped with aerodynamic fins for flight stability and control. The reflector further includes a laser receiver for receiving course correction signal commands from the launcher to relay to the guidance instruments on the projectile .

A launcher receiver associated with the emitter receives the reflection signal from the reflector . The ground position velocity and attitude of the launcher either stationary or mounted to a mobile platform can be measured accurately and combined with the laser measurement to obtain the ground position velocity and attitude of the projectile . After obtaining measurements of the projectile s position velocity and attitude based on the reflected signal course corrections are transmitted by an encoded laser signal to the laser receiver on the projectile to reset the INS.

This resetting instrument consists of the laser emitter that sends a short pulse beam to the retro reflector located on the projectile aft end within a millisecond after the projectile exists from the launcher . At this stage of the trajectory the projectile can be directly ahead of the laser emitter . The reflector returns the reflection signal to the origin of the initial laser pulse beam which is received by a launch sensor coexisting with the emitter . Then the instrument of the various exemplary embodiments uses a process such as phase detection or an interferometer to measure the distance between the launcher and the projectile . The velocity of the projectile can then be determined by differencing the position of the projectile from at least two very short and rapid pulses or by a direct measurement of the Doppler frequency shift of the reflected light. Such short pulses can be separated by intervals of less than a millisecond.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a method in which the pitch and yaw angle attitude of the projectile can also be measured. The reflection efficiency of the retro reflector is designed to be monotonically dependent on the pitch and yaw angle combination at which the laser beam arrives at the retro reflector . The magnitude of the reflected return signal may then be used to determine the attitude of the projectile in terms of the pitch and yaw angle using computational processing. Within a required resolution grid each pitch and yaw angle combination has a unique reflection efficiency. Knowledge of the emitter s signal strength the distance of the projectile from the launcher as measured by the launcher s receiver based on the return signal the retro reflector map enables the pitch and yaw angles to be determined based on the roll angle of the projectile .

As a summary of the process various exemplary embodiments include the following operations. A method provides for guiding a projectile fired longitudinally from a launcher along a ballistic trajectory and includes providing prior to launch a first inertial navigation system INS a laser emitter and optical sensor on the launcher providing a second INS and a laser reflector on the projectile and presetting the second INS to an initial reference position prior to firing the projectile. Subsequent to launch the method further includes emitting a longitudinally directed laser beam from the emitter to the reflector less than one millisecond subsequent to firing the projectile receiving the reflected signal to the optical sensor on the launcher determining a ground position altitude and velocity of the projectile based on the reflected signal transmitting a correction signal including the measured projectile s position altitude and velocity relative to the launcher as well as the time of measurement to the projectile from the launcher resetting position altitude and velocity for the second INS at a position prior to reaching maximum altitude based on extrapolation from the correction signal and guiding the projectile by orientation adjustment of the control fins .

The advantages of the exemplary system include increased accuracy and lethality of indirect short range munitions while maintaining a relatively low cost mortar design. The new feature is the resetting of the INS of the guided mortar by the direct measurement of the mortar position velocity and attitude by a simple laser device attached to the mortar launcher. The linking of this information to the mortar round in flight by an encoded laser beam to a receiver on the mortar round and resetting the ground position altitude and velocity states of the second INS on the projectile constitute new features.

Alternatives to these exemplary methods include the use of very fast acquisition GPS receivers that can reject jamming signals near the vehicle horizon angle. If such receivers could be built to survive launch accelerations these would increase the cost of size of the round and make pre launch operations more complex because of the need to load the GPS ephemeris into the round before launch. Thus these alternatives provide disadvantages that are mitigated by various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
