title: Deployment system for multi-node applications
abstract: A deployment system provides the ability to deploy a multi-node distributed application, such as a cloud computing platform application, which has a plurality of interconnected nodes performing specialized jobs. The deployment system includes a deployment director that provisions an infrastructure that includes one or more virtual machines (VMs) for hosting the plurality of nodes of the cloud computing platform application. The deployment director distributes a plurality of jobs (e.g., application packages and configurations) to deployment agents executing on the provisioned VMs, based on a mapping in the deployment manifest between the infrastructure and the plurality of specialized jobs to be performed by the cloud computing platform application. The deployment agents apply the jobs to their respective VM (e.g., launching applications), thereby deploying the cloud computing platform application.

 Platform as a Service also commonly referred to as PaaS generally describes a suite of technologies provided by a service provider as an integrated solution that enables a web developer or any other application developer to build deploy and manage the life cycle of a web application or any other type of networked application . One primary component of PaaS is a cloud computing platform which is a network e.g. Internet etc. infrastructure run and maintained by the service provider upon which developed web applications may be deployed. By providing the hardware resources and software layers required to robustly run a web application the cloud computing platform enables developers to focus on the development of the web application itself and leave the logistics of scalability and other computing and storage resource requirements e.g. data storage database access processing power facilities power and bandwidth etc. to the cloud computing platform e.g. at a cost charged by the service provider . A service provider may additionally provide a plug in component to a traditional IDE i.e. integrated development environment that assists a developer who creates web applications using the IDE to properly structure develop and test such applications in a manner that is compatible with the service provider s cloud computing platform. Once the developer completes a web application using the IDE the plug in component assists the developer in deploying the web application into the cloud computing platform.

However due to complexities in providing flexible and scalable cloud computing platforms PaaS is offered by few service providers. Current implementations of cloud computing platforms use multiple components e.g. cloud controller health manager service provisioner router and application execution agents that perform different roles and coordinate amongst each other to provide cloud computing services. To deploy such a cloud computing platform a system administrator must build configure deploy and maintain each of the components e.g. cloud controller health manager service provisioner router and application execution agents . While deployment may be performed manually when installing all components on a single system e.g. laptop server the deployment process becomes challenging when the components are installed across a plurality of networked systems because in such installations each system must be provisioned with specific computing resources set up with a particular networking configuration and have a different software application installed with dependent libraries and or runtimes to perform the system s assigned role within the cloud computing platform. Additionally updating any of the components e.g. security patch for a library or operating system requires a system administrator to have to modify operations for other components in the cloud computing platform. For example when one of the components needs to be updated a system administrator may have to suspend operations of other components currently connected to the component or in another example update settings of other components to correctly connect to the updated component. Accordingly the deployment process for a multi node application such as a cloud computing platform may be too complex and time consuming for a system administrator to manage.

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a deployment system for a multi node distributed application e.g. a cloud computing platform having any number of nodes that perform specialized roles as well as any dependent software and or networking storage and service configurations utilized for each specialized role. Instances of the deployment system may be implemented on top of a hardware infrastructure that allows for dynamic provisioning of computing resources such as a virtualized infrastructure. The deployment system includes an automation framework that utilizes codified deployment manifests to automatically provision infrastructure e.g. virtual machines as well as install and configure application packages needed for each specialized role. The codified deployment manifests simplify the deployment process for a complex multi node application having varying requirements and enables repeatable and predictable deployments.

A method for deploying an application having a plurality of functional components that are executed on a plurality of different nodes according to an embodiment includes receiving by a deployment module a specification for the application. The specification specifies i a number of instances of each functional component of the application that is to be deployed and ii hardware properties that would be required by any node executing any one of the functional components. The method includes requesting a virtual infrastructure platform to launch a plurality of virtual machines VMs that is sufficient to execute each instance of a functional component in a separate VM. Each of the VMs i is configured to support hardware properties required by at least one of the functional components and ii includes an agent component configured to communicate with the deployment module. The method further includes directing each of the agent components in each of the VMs to install code in the VM that implements one of the functional components that is compatible with the hardware properties of the VM thereby causing the VM to execute as one of the instances of the functional components of the application.

A non transitory computer readable storage medium comprises instructions that when executed in a computing device deploy an application having a plurality of functional components that are executed on a plurality of different nodes. The non transitory computer readable storage medium include according to an embodiment instructions for performing the step of receiving by a deployment module a specification for the application wherein the specification specifies i a number of instances of each functional component of the application that is to be deployed and ii hardware properties that would be required by any node executing any one of the functional components. The instructions further perform the steps of requesting a virtual infrastructure platform to launch a plurality of virtual machines VMs that is sufficient to execute each instance of a functional component in a separate VM. Each of the VMs i is configured to support hardware properties required by at least one of the functional components and ii includes an agent component configured to communicate with the deployment module. The instructions further perform the steps of directing each of the agent components in each of the VMs to install code in the VM that implements one of the functional components that is compatible with the hardware properties of the VM thereby causing the VM to execute as one of the instances of the functional components of the application.

A computer system for deploying an application having a plurality of functional components that are executed on a plurality of different nodes includes according to an embodiment a system memory and a processor programmed to carry out the step of receiving by a deployment module a specification for the application. The specification specifies i a number of instances of each functional component of the application that is to be deployed and ii hardware properties that would be required by any node executing any one of the functional components. The processor is programmed to carry out the step of requesting a virtual infrastructure platform to launch a plurality of virtual machines VMs that is sufficient to execute each instance of a functional component in a separate VM wherein each of the VMs i is configured to support hardware properties required by at least one of the functional components and ii includes an agent component configured to communicate with the deployment module. The processor is further programmed to carry out the step of directing each of the agent components in each of the VMs to install code in the VM that implements one of the functional components that is compatible with the hardware properties of the VM thereby causing the VM to execute as one of the instances of the functional components of the application.

In one embodiment cloud controller orchestrates a deployment process for web applications submitted by a developer . Cloud controller interacts with other functional components of cloud computing platform application to bind services required by submitted web applications and package web applications for transmission to application execution agents for deployment. Health manager tracks and maintains the health of cloud computing platform application by monitoring messages broadcast on message bus by other functional components of cloud computing platform application . Web applications access a set of services provided by cloud computing platform application such as a relational database service e.g. MySQL etc. monitoring service background task scheduler logging service messaging service memory object caching service and the like. A service provisioner serves as a communications intermediary between services and other functional components of cloud computing platform application e.g. cloud controller health manager router etc. and assists with the task of provisioning or binding such available services to web applications during a web application deployment process. Message bus provides a common interface through which functional components of cloud computing platform application such as service provisioner cloud controller health manager router and application execution agents can communicate and receive notifications.

Once cloud controller successfully orchestrates the deployment of web application in one or more application execution agents an end user can access web application for example through a web browser or any other appropriate client application residing on a computer laptop or generally any computing device. Router receives the web browser s access request e.g. a uniform resource locator or URL and routes the request to the corresponding system which hosts web application .

As described each component has a separate role within cloud computing platform application with separate software application and library dependencies e.g. MySQL Redis MongoDB Apache and is specially built configured deployed and maintained for cloud computing platform application to function as a whole. Further since each component is typically run in one or more virtual machines VMs each VM is also specially provisioned configured deployed and maintained by a system administrator. As such cloud computing platform application in which web applications are deployed itself has a deployment procedure that is cumbersome and complex. Accordingly embodiments provide a deployment technique for cloud computing platform application that uses an automation framework and tooling for simplified automatic and repeatable deployments.

In one embodiment system administrator instructs deployment system by issuing one or more commands through an administrative client communicatively connected to deployment system for example through a command line interface CLI or other user interface of administrative client . In addition to transmitting one or more commands issued by system administrator administrative client may further transmit a bundle of application data configuration files and other information collectively referred to as a release which are unpacked processed and or distributed by deployment system to deploy cloud computing platform application as described later. In addition to the release administrative client provides a deployment manifest associated with the release that describes a desired computing environment of cloud computing platform application after cloud computing platform application has been deployed. The deployment manifest describes attributes of the desired computing environment such as a number of resource pools e.g. groups of VMs to be utilized networks to be set up and other settings as will be described later and functions as a specification for deployment in this embodiment.

Multi node application platform includes an infrastructure platform upon which cloud computing platform application is deployed and executed. In the embodiment of infrastructure platform comprises hardware resources such as servers to and one or more storage array networks SAN such as SAN which are configured in a manner to provide a virtualization environment that supports execution of a plurality of virtual machines VMs across servers to . As further detailed below these VMs provide virtual computing resources that support the services and functions carried out by deployment system as well as virtual computing resources for hosting functional components of the cloud computing platform application . In one embodiment infrastructure platform may be implemented as cloud infrastructure services or other Infrastructure as a Service IaaS that provide computer infrastructure as a service.

Virtualization environment includes an orchestration component e.g. implemented as a process running in a virtual machine in one embodiment that monitors the infrastructure resource consumption levels and requirements of deployment system e.g. by monitoring communications routed through addressing and discovery layer as further detailed below and provides additional infrastructure resources to deployment system as needed or desired. For example if deployment system requires additional VMs to host newly deployed functional components of cloud computing platform application and scale the currently running multi node application to support peak demands orchestration component can initiate and manage the instantiation of virtual machines on servers to to support such needs. In one example implementation of an embodiment similar to that of virtualization environment may be implemented by running VMware ESX based hypervisor technologies on servers to provided by VMware Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. although it should be recognized that any other virtualization technologies including Xen and Microsoft Hyper V virtualization technologies may be utilized consistent with the teachings herein .

In the embodiment of deployment system includes a deployment director e.g. running in one or more VMs that orchestrates the deployment process for cloud computing platform application according to a deployment manifest that has been submitted to deployment system . Deployment director receives instructions of the deployment manifest and interacts with other components of deployment system to generate a logical infrastructure onto which cloud computing platform application is to be deployed. In the embodiment depicted in deployment director exposes a communications interface such as a Representative State Transfer REST architecture through which deployment director receives administrative commands and other deployment data e.g. a release from a client e.g. administrative client .

Deployment director may provision VMs identified as stem cell VMs to to host functional components of cloud computing platform application such as cloud controller application execution agents health manager router service provisioner etc. In the embodiment of deployment director request infrastructure platform to dynamically create and delete stem cell VMs e.g. stem cell VMs to . Stem cell VMs to are VMs created based on a pre defined VM template referred to as stem cell that includes a base operating system an agent and supporting libraries runtimes and or applications. Agents coordinate with deployment director to configure stem cell VMs to to perform various roles of cloud computing platform application . Agents applies a particular job to a stem cell VM executing thereon such that stem cell VM performs a particular management role within cloud computing platform application e.g. the job of one of cloud controller health manager application execution agents etc. .

In addition to provisioning stem cell VMs deployment director may request infrastructure platform to dynamically create and delete temporary VMs referred to as workers which perform one or more processing tasks that facilitate deployment. In one embodiment for example workers may be created to perform software compilation for component applications and or libraries to be deployed on stem cell VMs to . Workers are configured with a similar configuration as stem cell VMs to e.g. have an identical virtual hardware specification architecture and or configuration to enable compiled software to execute on stem cell VMs to . Results of processing tasks e.g. software compilation and other cached data may be stored in an object store e.g. blob store used to hold artifacts generated during the deployment process. Further deployment director may utilize a set of services e.g. run in one or more VMs to facilitate orchestration of the deployment process. For example a relational database service e.g. MySQL etc. monitoring service background task scheduler logging service messaging service memory object caching service and the like may comprise services .

Addressing and discovery layer provides a common interface through which components of deployment system such as deployment director health monitor services workers and one or more agents executing on stem cell VMs to can communicate and receive notifications. For example deployment director may utilize addressing and discovery layer to request the provisioning of VMs from infrastructure platform and to provide agents with deployment instructions during deployment of cloud computing platform application . Similarly stem cell VM may communicate through addressing and discovery layer with other stem cell VMs through addressing and discovery layer during deployment of cloud computing platform application . In one embodiment addressing and discovery layer is implemented as a message brokering service e.g. running in one or more VMs that defines a common protocol and message format through which components of deployment system can exchange messages and broadcast notifications and other information. In such an embodiment the components of deployment system establish a connection with the message brokering service e.g. also sometimes referred to as subscribing to the message brokering service for example through known authentication techniques e.g. passwords etc. and once connected to the message brokering service can provide receive and request messages notifications and other similar information to and from other components that have also subscribed to the message brokering system. One example of a message brokering service that may be used in an embodiment is RabbitMQ which is based upon the AMPQ Advanced Message Queuing Protocol open protocol standard. It should be recognized however that alternative interfaces and communication schemes may be implemented for addressing and discovery layer other than such a message brokering service.

Deployment system further comprises a health monitor e.g. run in a VM that tracks and maintains the health of deployment system by monitoring messages broadcast on addressing and discovery layer by other components of deployment system . For example health monitor may detect a lack of communication from an agent e.g. run on a stem cell VM and determine the failure of the stem cell VM e.g. failure of a component of cloud computing platform application . Health monitor may automatically broadcast a request to deployment director to re start the failed stem cell VM or provision a replacement stem cell VM to perform the same role. Health monitor may be further configured to initiate restart of failed available services or other components of deployment system e.g. deployment director object store services workers and one or more agents executing on stem cell VMs to etc. .

It should be recognized that deployment system architectures other than the embodiment of may be implemented consistent with the teachings herein. For example while implements deployment system on an infrastructure platform hosted by multi node application platform it should be recognized that deployment system may be implemented by entities other than multi node application platform on top of any type of hardware infrastructure such as on a non virtualized infrastructure platform as processes or daemons directly on hardware resources . It should further be recognized that embodiments may configure deployment system and infrastructure platform in a loosely coupled manner with communication between deployment system and infrastructure platform only occurring through orchestration component of infrastructure platform which monitors hardware resource consumption by connecting to addressing and discovery layer . In such loosely coupled embodiments it should be recognized that deployment system may be implemented on any infrastructure platform including on a laptop or personal computer e.g. in which case each component of deployment system runs as a separate process or daemon on the laptop or personal computer .

Deployment manifest may specify a network configuration for cloud computing platform application that includes one or more networks and or virtual local area networks VLANs . For example deployment manifest may define one or more network having settings that specify subnets static or dynamic IP addresses gateways and DNS addresses and reserved Internet Protocol IP addresses i.e. IP addresses not to be used by deployment system . In the example deployment in Table 1 a first network labeled management and a second network labeled apps are specified under a section titled networks. The network labeled management is specified having a static IP address range of 11.23.3.2.17 to 11.23.2.128 with a gateway address of 11.23.2.1 and DNS address of 11.22.22.153. Deployment manifest may specify a range of the network that may be used by deployment director as a dynamic pool of IP address minus static and reserved IP addresses. Gateway and DNS information specified by deployment manifest may be passed onto stem cell VMs and agents executing thereon for their initial launch and bootstrapping. Deployment manifest may include in each section one or more pass through settings e.g. cloud properties that will be provided to infrastructure platform during deployment.

Based on deployment manifest deployment director generates a logical infrastructure comprising one or more resource pools identified as resource pools and in that associate stem cell VMs with a stem cell e.g. VM template and a network. For example a resource pool labeled small is associated with a stem cell specified as bosh stemcell version 0.2.39 and with the management network defined within deployment manifest . A stem cell refers to a VM template that defines a generalized software infrastructure that supports execution of a job provided by deployment director and as specified by deployment manifest . In some embodiments the stem cell is a VM template that includes an agent installed on a guest operating system and any supporting runtimes frameworks and libraries for the agent . Each resource pool may be assigned a size corresponding to a number of stem cell VMs to be provisioned for the resource pool. For example deployment director provisions 14 stem cell VMs for the small resource pool. Deployment manifest may include pass through settings for infrastructure platform for provisioning resource pools . For example the cloud properties section indicates ram disk and cpu properties that are intended for use by infrastructure platform in provisioning stem cell VMs i.e. having 1024 MB of RAM 4096 Mb of disk space and 1 CPU for the small resource pool.

Deployment manifest may define a specialized resource pool of workers e.g. workers for compilation of software packages and or other ancillary processing tasks during deployment. The specialized resource pool of workers may comprise one or more ancillary VMs provided by infrastructure platform . Deployment manifest may specify the number of VMs allocated to the workers resource pool and a network on which compilation may be performed. For example the compilation section above specifies a resource pool having 6 workers assigned to the management network for compiling software packages.

Deployment manifest defines a plurality of jobs that may be performed by one or more stem cell VMs M as one or more roles in cloud computing platform application e.g. cloud controller router application execution agents health manager service provisioner services message bus etc. . Deployment manifest specifies a mapping of each job onto logical infrastructure of resource pools and networks specified above. Deployment manifest may specify the number of instances to be deployed of a particular job which resource pool to use stem cell VMs and or which network the job is on. For example in the example in Table 1 a job labeled as cloud controller is listed as having eight instances e.g. stem cell VMs drawn from resource pool large and assigned to the management network. Each job may include a number of configuration file templates wherein key parameters e.g. login credentials IP addresses ports are specified as variables.

In one embodiment deployment manifest includes a properties section that provides enables a system administrator to parameterize these configuration file templates. As such when deployment director deploys cloud computing platform application deployment director may parse the configuration file templates and fill in the appropriate parameters based on the corresponding values provided in properties section. For example a router job may have a configuration file that lists a login credential for the router service as variables . In such an example deployment director parses out and evaluates the variables based on user and password name value pairs provided in the properties section. Table 2 lists an example configuration file template embodied as a Ruby on Rails script file e.g. ERB template that may be parsed by deployment director .

In step deployment director determines a logical infrastructure to host cloud computing platform application based on deployment manifest . For example in one embodiment deployment director processes deployment manifest to determine an allocation of stem cell VMs organized into resource pools and network groupings for hosting nodes of cloud computing platform application . In step deployment director transmits a provision request for a plurality of stem cell VMs based on logical infrastructure determined in step to infrastructure platform which in turn receives the provisioning request in step . For example in one embodiment deployment director may call for provision of instances of a stem cell VM from a cloud infrastructure service provider utilizing a cloud provider Application Programming Interface sometimes referred to as a cloud provider interface CPI . In step infrastructure platform creates one or more instances of stem cell VMs utilizing a stem cell template having agent pre installed and having resource and network configurations as specified by deployment manifest . For example in one embodiment infrastructure platform may create a stem cell VM utilizing a template e.g. stem cell having a packaged format such as Open Virtualization Format OVF and containing a guest operating system kernel utilities e.g. openssh server monit libraries e.g. libxml libmysql libsqlite runtime dependencies e.g. Ruby Java Virtual Machine and agent . In one particular implementation the stem cell may be generated prior to start of the deployment procedure and stored for later retrieval by infrastructure platform and or deployment director .

In step one or more stem cell VMs e.g. stem cell VM begins operation and launches agent . In step deployment director provides job configuration and data to stem cell VMs for each job specified by deployment manifest via addressing and discovery layer . For example deployment director determines that deployment manifest specifies a cloud controller job uses eight instances of stem cell VMs drawn from a pre determined resource pool and from a pre determined network group. Deployment director provides job configuration and data for the cloud controller job to eight instances of stem cell VMs . In step stem cell VMs e.g. stem cell VM receives the job configuration and data via address and discovery layer . Job configuration and data may include one or more packaged applications libraries runtimes configuration files metadata and other supporting data for performing a role within cloud computing platform application . In one embodiment agent may retrieve job configuration and data utilizing a link or address provided by deployment director and corresponding to one or more data objects stored in object store . In step agent applies the received job configuration and data to transform stem cell VM into a distributed node within cloud computing platform application . Agent installs one or more application packages of the received job data utilizes the received job configuration to perform any suitable setup and configuration of the installed software packages and launches processes for connecting to other deployed jobs of cloud computing platform application and performing one or more specialized tasks within cloud computing platform application . For example in one embodiment agent may install configure and launch one or more application packages for executing a router e.g. router to forward incoming requests to other components of cloud computing platform application that are running web applications. Deployment director repeats operations of step until all jobs have been deployed onto one or more stem cell VMs as specified by deployment manifest . As such after the deployment procedure has been completed a plurality of stem cell VMs have transformed into a plurality of interconnected nodes that constitute a deployed cloud computing platform application e.g. cloud controller application execution agents health manager router service provisioner etc. as depicted in .
