This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 178780 filed on Aug. 18 2011 in Japanese Patent Office the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to a heat producing fixing belt to thermally fix a dry toner image formed by an electrostatic latent image developing system such as electrophotography and an image forming apparatus using the same.

Conventionally in image forming apparatuses such as copiers and laser beam printers a method in which arts toner development an unfixed toner image having been transferred or an image support such as plain paper is subjected to contact heating fixing using a heat roller system has been used in many cases.

However in such a heat roller system it takes long time to achieve the fixable temperature by healing and also a large amount of heating energy is required. From the viewpoint of shortening the time from power activation to copy start the warning up time and of energy saving recently a heat film fixing system has become mainstream.

In a fixing device fixing unit of this heat film fixing system a seamless fixing belt in which a releasable layer of e.g. a fluorine resin is laminated on fee outer surface of a heat resistant film of e.g. polyimide is used.

However in a fixing device of such a heat film fixing system since a film is heated for example via a ceramic heater and then a toner image is fixed on the film surface the thermal conductivity of the film becomes critical. However when tire fixing belt film is allowed to be thinner to improve the thermal conductivity mechanical strength tends to decrease and then it becomes difficult to realize high speed rotation whereby formation of a high quality image at high speed becomes problematic and also a problem such that the ceramic heater is liable to break is produced.

To solve such problems recently a fixing belt itself provided with a heat producing body hereinafter referred to as a heat producing fixing belt has been investigated and then a method has been proposed in which power is supplied to this heat producing body whereby the fixing belt is directly heated to fix a toner image. In an image forming apparatus using such a heat producing fixing belt warming up time is shortened and power consumption is further reduced compared to the heat film fixing system. Therefore a heat fixing device has been investigated since excellent energy saving and speeding up are exhibited.

There is known a fixing belt having a heat producing belt of a three dimensional network structural body in which a core material made of for example iron SUS copper cobalt nickel chromium aluminum gold platinum silver tin or palladium is covered with a fluorine resin polyimide resin polyamide resin or polyamideimide resin refer to for example Patent Document 1 .

A heat producing fixing belt provided with a heat producing layer incorporating a polyimide resin in which a carbon nanomaterial and filament metal fine particles are dispersed an insulating layer and a releasing layer is known refer to for example Patent Document 2 .

There is known a heat producing fixing belt having an insulating layer incorporating a polyimide resin a resistance heat producing body layer in which in a matrix resin containing a polyimide resin a carbon nanomaterial and filament metal fine particles are substantially uniformly present by dispersion and a releasing layer and an electrode layer refer to for example Patent Document 3 .

However the heat producing fixing belt described in Patent Document 1 becomes oxidized over long tem use resulting in an increase in resistance. Thereby it was found that the problem that a predetermined heat producing amount was not obtained was produced.

In the heat producing fixing belt described in Patent Document 2 with heating and cooling of a polyimide resin the resin is elasticized resulting in a change in resistance. It was found that at the interface between the filler and the resin cracks and breakages occurred and then such a portion had a problem such that fixing could not be sufficiently carried out.

In the heat producing fixing belt described in Patent Document 3 with heating and cooling of a polyimide resin the resin is elasticized resulting in a change in resistance. It was found that at the interface between the filler and the resin cracks and breakages occurred and then such a portion had a problem such that fixing could not be sufficiently carried out.

In view of such situations it has been expected to develop a heat producing fixing belt in which even with long term use surface resistance value and volume resistance value are varied just to a small extent and the heat producing layer is prevented from breaking and cracking and an image forming apparatus using this heat producing fixing belt.

In view of the above situations the present invention was completed and an object thereof is to provide a heat producing fixing belt in which even with long term use surface resistance value and volume resistance value are varied just to a small extent and the heat producing layer is prevented from cracking and breaking and an image forming apparatus using this heat producing fixing belt.

1. A heat producing fixing belt of a cylindrical shape containing a heat producing layer an elastic layer and a releasing layer in this sequential order from the inner side in which

a pair of electrodes to supply power to the heat producing layer making contact with the fabric containing carbon fiber are provided on both ends of the cylindrical shape.

2. The heat producing fixing belt described in aspect 1 in which the size of the carbon fiber is 66 tex to 800 tex.

3. The heat producing fixing belt described in aspect 1 or 2 in which the fabric is textile having a warp density and a woof density of 7.5 yarns 25 mm to 22.5 yarns 25 mm.

4. An image forming apparatus using the heat producing fixing belt described in any of aspects 1 to 3.

The present inventors investigated why cracks and breakages occurred over time due to long term use while the variation of the surface resistance value and the variation of the volume resistance value were small and then found the following.

When a belt used over a long term in which fixing nonuniformity occurred was analyzed cracks and breakages of the heat producing layer were observed. It was assumed that in the cracked and broken portions no current flowed and then no heat was produced resulting in fixing nonuniformity. In other words it can be said that the presence of discontinuous filler induces such cracks and breakages.

Hence to realize the state where oxidation resistance is enhanced and controlled in order to allow this discontinuous filler to be continuous heat producing elements were investigated. Thereby it was found out that when fabric employing carbon fiber was used as the heat producing element this problem was able to be solved.

There were able to be provided a heat producing fixing belt in which surface resistance value and volume resistance value were varied just to a small extent and the heat producing layer was prevented from cracking and breaking and an image forming apparatus using this heat producing fixing belt.
