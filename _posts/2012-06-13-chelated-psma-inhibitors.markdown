PCT US2012 042283 filed Jun. 13 2012 which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 647 932 filed May 16 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 497 206 filed Jun. 15 2011 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

This application was supported by Grant No. 1R44CA153481 01A1 and Grant No. R01CA140617 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to small molecules having high affinity and specificity to prostrate specific membrane antigen PSMA and methods of using them for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Prostate specific membrane antigen PSMA is uniquely overexpressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells as well as in the neovasculature of a variety of solid tumors. As a result PSMA has attracted attention as a clinical biomarker for detection and management of prostate cancer. Generally these approaches utilize an antibody specifically targeted at PSMA to direct imaging or therapeutic agents. For example ProstaScint Cytogen Philadelphia Pa. which has been approved by the FDA for the detection and imaging of prostate cancer utilizes an antibody to deliver a chelated radioisotope Indium 111 . However it is now recognized that the ProstaScint technology is limited to the detection of dead cells and therefore its clinical relevance is questionable.

The success of cancer diagnosis and therapy using antibodies is limited by challenges such as immunogenicity and poor vascular permeability. In addition large antibodies bound to cell surface targets present a barrier for subsequent binding of additional antibodies at neighboring cell surface sites resulting in a decreased cell surface labeling.

In addition to serving as a cell surface target for antibodies delivering diagnostic or therapeutic agents a largely overlooked and unique property of PSMA is its enzymatic activity. That is PSMA is capable of recognizing and processing molecules as small as dipeptides. Despite the existence of this property it has been largely unexplored in terms of the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. There are a few recent examples in the literature that have described results in detecting prostate cancer cells using labeled small molecule inhibitors of PSMA.

Certain phosphoramidate and phosphate PSMA inhibitors have been described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007 0219165 A1.

Provided herein are PET diagnostics and therapeutics for prostate cancer that capitalize on the potency and specific affinity of small molecule inhibitors to PSMA. The diagnostic agents can be used to monitor and stratify patients for treatment with appropriate therapeutic agents.

Our probes are comprised of a PSMA targeting a peptidomimetic core coupled to an imaging reporter or to a therapeutic radiotracer. In one aspect we have demonstrated that Tc chelate structures can be used be used to radiolabel our PSMA inhibitors and that the labeled probe specifically targets and internalizes into PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells and tumors.

In another aspect we have developed a direct labeling protocol using the PET isotope Ga with a chelate structure PSMA inhibitor conjugate that can be performed in a typical radiopharmacy and may provide an efficient synthesis pathway while maintaining the necessary biological activity. These PSMA imaging constructs can serve as the foundation for a PET imaging agent and can be easily modified to incorporate other PET imaging radionuclides such as Zr and Cu and a radiometal such as Re Y Lu Sm Bi Ac Ra in the chelate structure that can serve as a therapeutic agent for targeted radiotherapy.

For example the design of PSMA targeted imaging agents can be modified and optimized for chelated Zr or Cu or Ga labeling using desferrioxamine p SCN or p SCN Bn NOTA p SCN Bn PCTA p SCN Bn Oxo DO3A and DOTA NHS amine reactive chelate structures as examples. The labeling conditions may ensure efficient and reproducible labeling in clinical radiopharmacies for PET imaging of prostate tumors. PSMA targeted imaging agents can also be modified with Re Y Lu Sm Bi Ac Ra in chelated structures to achieve a PSMA targeted radiotracer with therapeutic efficacy.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the preceding aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides methods for imaging one or more prostate cancer cells or tumor associated vasculature in a patient comprising administering to the patient a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of either of the preceding aspects.

Isotopes that are currently used in PET imaging studies are attractive and potentially better alternatives to F Ga Cu and Zr are available isotopes that are being assessed for PET imaging due to their light metal properties and the ability to bind to chelating agents 1 . We have chosen isotopes Re Y Lu Sm Bi Ac Ra as radioisotopes with potential therapeutic efficacy.

It has been shown that the chelating agent DOTA 1 4 7 10 tetraazacyclododecane 1 4 7 10 tetraacetic acid or modified derivatives thereof is an excellent ligand for binding of gallium and DOTA peptides can be rapidly and efficiently labeled with Ga at high specific activities 2 . We have already prepared and tested these chelating agents and these types of chelating agents have been routinely used for PET imaging agents 1 . The rationale for the Ga metal isotope is driven by biological cost and patient considerations. The Ga isotope is the most attractive of the radiometals since it s half live is closer to that of F and would facilitate imaging soon after administration with reduced exposure to the patient. It has been shown that due to rapid diffusion of many small molecules and peptides the 68 minute half life of Ga very closely matches the pharmacokinetics of these molecules resulting in better tumor localization and faster blood clearance. In addition a significant factor in selecting Ga is that it can be cost effectively and continuously produced by a commercially available Ge Ga generator alleviating the need for proximity of PET centers to the cyclotrons needed for the production of for example F 2 .

According to the Clinical Trials Network www.clinicaltrials.gov there are currently four PET imaging oncology clinical trials using Cu labeled targeting agents two in breast cancer using Cu DOTA Trastuzumab 3 and two for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer using Cu ATSM 4 . There are two ongoing PET imaging Clinical Trials with Ga. One using Ga labeled F ab 2 trastuzumab for breast cancer and one using Ga bombesin 5 for prostate cancer. Zr is also being tested with antibody targeted imaging 6 7 in seven clinical studies testing imaging capabilities in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma.

We have preserved the modular approach to install metallic PET radionuclides into our PSMA targeting inhibitors. We functionalize our PSMA targeting inhibitors with selected amine reactive bifunctional chelators and subsequently radiolabel these conjugates with complementary metallic radionuclides. Amine reactive chelate structures for these radionuclides are commercially available such as DOTA NHS and others noted in the following table where the chelator can be attached in the R groups via the divalent linking group as defined herein L in the following

When Ris an optionally substituted benzyl group e.g. unsubstituted benzyl suitable deprotection conditions include but are not limited to hydrogenolysis conditions e.g. Hand Pd C or catalytic hydrogen transfer using ammonium formate and Pd C. Other hydrogenation catalysts may be used as are familiar to those skilled in the art.

In certain embodiments alternative hydrogen sources may be used including but not limited to ammonium formate sodium formate or formic acid with triethylamine. In certain embodiments the hydrogen source is ammonium formate.

The hydrogenation may be undertake in a suitable solvent selected from but not limited to ethanol tetrahydrofuran water or phosphate buffered saline or a mixture thereof.

For example in certain embodiments the deprotection can be setup in a cartridge where the Pd C catalyst is loaded in a layer or distributed in inert material then the protected compound dissolved in a solvent such as ethanol is further dissolved in ammonium formate and flushed through the cartridge to yield deprotected material without the need for further purification.

Radiochemical purity of Tc DTPA SCN CTT 54 was determined to be greater than 95 as confirmed by HPLC. In vitro studies using PSMA LNCaP cells and PSMA PC3 cells confirmed the specificity of this radiolabeled bifunctional chelator PSMA inhibitor conjugate for PSMA was preserved . Furthermore over 70 of these molecules associated with LNCaP cells were internalized within 30 min. Although the amount of uptake increases over time the internalization is rapid for these agents.

In biodistribution studies we also confirmed the in vivo targeting of this Tc DTPA SCN CTT 54. Radiolabeled Tc CO DTPA LW 54 was injected via a tail vein into male nu nu mice bearing both LNCaP PSMA and PC3 PSMA tumor xenografts and biodistribution data was collected at 2 and 4 hours. The data clearly demonstrates selective uptake in the LNCaP tumor while there is no detectable signal in the PC3 xenografts data shown in for the 4 h time point .

These data show that a bifunctional chelator can be successfully coupled to PSMA targeting inhibitor CTT 54 and that the resulting conjugate can be labeled with a metallic radionuclide using a post labeling approach. The literature precedent for Cu Ga and Zr radio labeling of the selected bifunctional chelators when coupled to other targeting agents through a post labeling approach further supports the likelihood of success in the revised approach.

Suitable radioisotopes for use in the chelates herein include but are not limited to Cu Ga Zr Re Y Lu Sm Bi Ac and Ra. These are particularly attractive isotopes due to their light metal properties and the ability to bind to chelating agents 1 . As stated above we have already achieved preliminary success with a chelated radiolabel on our PSMA inhibitor.

In certain examples the labeling efficiency of the chelates herein can be greater than 60 decay corrected with any of the light metal isotopes with an overall yield greater than 40 decay corrected . The specific activity may change slightly with each isotope but only 2 3 fold depending on the isotope. Typically 1 10 mCi of imaging agent is administered per patient.

Following administration of the chelated PSMA inhibitors herein the imaging time may be altered to alter and or optimize imaging characteristics. A recent paper by Pomper s laboratory 10 demonstrated the utility of a reversible PSMA inhibitor Ga DOTA urea based inhibitor in PET imaging of prostate cancer tumors in a mouse xenograft model. However this is a sub optimal reversible inhibitor that demonstrates decreased PET imaging as well as decreased tumor uptake over time. In comparison uptake of the PSMA inhibitor CTT 54 in the fraction associated with the tumor continues to increase over time.

The decay half life of Cu and Zr are much longer 12.7 and 78.4 hours respectively . The advantages are three fold. First the timing of imaging between manufacture of the final imaging agent and animal human imaging is less important. Second there can be additional time between injection of the imaging agent and the PET scan which will allow additional renal clearance of any unbound material and additional time for clearance from the kidneys liver and bladder. Thirdly the longer half lives allow for longitudinal studies on a patient with a single injection of the imaging agent.

Presently there are no current marketed commercial Zr Cu Ga labeled PET imaging agents for prostate cancer. The PET market is the fastest growing segment of the nuclear imaging market Chemical Engineering News Molecular Imaging Volume 83 Number 30 pp. 25 34 .

The ease with which the Ga can be generated from a GMP commercially available source that can be stored for up to a year may make this product more attractive than one which is dependent on proximity to a cyclotron. Commercial GMP sources for the generators exist e.g IDB markets an iThemba GMP 68 gallium generator. The parent isotope Ge has a half life of 271 days and can be easily sent to hospitals within the generator where it is storable for almost a year. The on site generator is required to minimize the time losses since there will be pharmaceutical preparation time to attach the gallium 68 as a tracer to the pharmaceutical chelate molecules so that the total preparation time may approach the isotope half life.

In one example a Ga chelating group is attached to a PMSA inhibitor as shown in the preceding scheme. Therein an azide terminated chelator e.g. DOTA modified with 3 azidopropylamine is reacted under Cu free conditions familiar in the art with a DBCO modified PMSA inhibitor to yield a chelator labeled PSMA inhibitor. The Ga chelate may be formed either prior to or after the azide coupling step. In another example the DBCO modified PMSA inhibitor may comprise a polyethyleneoxide linking group as seen in the following.

Based on preliminary labeling and deprotection studies with the serine based scaffold of CTT54 acid and base stability issues were noted. The instability of CTT54 and its protected precursors under basic conditions is due to beta elimination on serine to yield a dehydroalanine derivative. The acid instability was centered on the P N bond of CTT54 which precluded the use of acid modifiers in HPLC mobile phases. It was found that the substitution of serine in the CTT54 scaffold with homoserine Or 2 3 hydroxypropyl glycine solved both the acid and basic stability issues. The homoserine analog was known initially as hCTT54 and later more formally as CTT1000. The 2 3 hydroxypropyl glycine is known as TG97 and CTT2000. The base stability was expected as the beta elimination problem associated with phosphorylated serine residue would be blocked. However the acid stability was unexpected. In addition to the improved stability these compounds retain their binding to PSMA CTT1000 IC 15 nM irreversible CTT2000 IC 27 nM irreversible.

The room temperature stability of hCTT54 was monitored by P NMR at various values using I M buffers 8 7.5 7 6.5 5.5 4.5. 4 3 2. The following 1M buffers were used HCl KCl for pH 2 Citrate for pH 3 4 Acetate for pH 4.5 and 5.5 1 M Tris maleate for pH 6.5 7 1 M Tris HCl for pH of 7.5 8. The procedures for determining pH stability by P NMR are detailed as follows. The sample 4 mg was dissolved buffer 1 of a 1 M solution resulting in a approximately a 5 mM solution of the analyte CTT1000 or CTT2000 . The pH was adjusted as necessary usually with HCl actual pH noted on spectra and the time was defined as t 0. An initial P NMR spectra was obtained t 0.5 h and acquired each hour 1 8 h The external reference for P NMR was triphenylphosphine oxide 27 ppm .

The unconjugated core of hCTT54 CTT1000 was stable for 8 hours with no detectable hydrolysis down to pH 4.5 possible hydrolysis products in the NMR samples were not observed by mass spectrometry. This acid stability enables the use of acid modifiers in HPLC mobile phases and acid labile protecting groups such as tBu. The inhibitor core TG97 CTT2000 was stable for 8 hours with no detectable hydrolysis down to pH 3.
