This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 577 418 filed Dec. 19 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This application also relates to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 612 765 entitled Computer implemented method for displaying an individual timeline of a user of a social network computer system and computer readable medium thereof filed on Sep. 12 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 533 277 filed on Sep. 12 2011 entitled A computer implemented method for displaying an individual timeline of a user of a social network computer system and computer readable medium thereof and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 612 773 entitled Computer implemented method for posting messages about future events to users of a social network computer system and computer readable medium thereof filed on Sep. 12 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 533 279 filed on Sep. 12 2011 entitled A computer implemented method for posting messages about future events to users of a social network computer system and computer readable medium thereof the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The present disclosure relates in general to social networks run in a computer environment and related in particular to methods and systems for selectively displaying content to a registered user member of a social network.

With the increasing popularity of social networking traditional forms of joining sharing interests and hobbies and making appointments e.g. by joining social clubs attending social events meeting friends through other friends and so forth are replaced by social activities via the Internet in particular by some sort of social forum for networking and meeting new people. It can even be said that for many people the Internet nowadays represents the principal way in which the people meet new friends and remain in touch with existing friends because the Internet enables establishing and maintaining interactions between vast numbers of individuals.

For this purpose various social networking websites have been developed in recent years. Social networking websites can provide organizational tools and forums for allowing these individuals to interact with one another via the social networking website. Many users prefer to limit communications to specific groups of other users or friends sharing the same or similar interests and activities.

Social network websites also display content to the users in a manner similar to standard portals in the Internet the content covering potential interests of the users of the social network. Typical websites display their information content based on terms the user does not define himself such as the latest news based on time advertisements based on the interest of advertising companies or content that is placed on that page by the decision of the hosts.

To run a successful community the site needs to present all available content in a format that satisfies every user e.g. the content presented is suited for the user and is very relevant to what the user is looking for in the context the user is in. It can even be said that the success of a social network will depend on the relevance of the content displayed to the respective user. Therefore there exists a need to selectively display content to the respective user of a social network website in accordance with the preferences and or interests of the respective user.

US 2010 0088322 A1 discloses a method for identifying so called hot topics. Whether a topic is hot may be determined based on a change in a volume of search queries related to the topic. For example if an increase in search query volume is above a particular threshold the topic related to the search query may be deemed a hot topic.

US 2009 0171869 A1 discloses that one or more future hot terms may be predicted according to a classification process.

US 2007 0016609 A1 relates to tools that can analyze content to determine its traits classify the content based on its traits and present the content in a user interface tailored to the classification. The tools can also organize content items into groups based on a common trait and enable a user to select content items through their group. Responsive to the user s selection of a group the tools can present content render enclosures and alter traits of the content items in the group.

US 2009 0319914 A1 discloses a method for determining a relationship between participants in an online community based on various facts. The nature of the relationship is represented in a user interface UI by a visual element that shows the extent or depth of the relationship. Facets of the relationship may be used to facilitate interaction between participants e.g. if two participants both like a particular band then information relevant to the band may be shown as part of the UI when the participants interact with each other . The nature of the relationship may be determined or characterized based on commonality of activities commonality of interests the extent to which the participants have interacted with each other in the past or other facts.

The present application is directed to an enhanced method and system for selectively displaying content to a user of a social network and in particular to methods and systems for selectively displaying content to a registered user member of a social network in accordance with selectable pre selectable or adjustable settings of the user such as preferences and or interests wherein the settings are preferably stored as part of the profile of the user on a central service of the social network. The method and system according to the present application enhances the efficiency to provide relevant content to a user of a social network or online community.

According to the present disclosure there is provided a computer implemented method for selectively displaying content to a user of a social network comprising maintaining in a computer system for each user of said social network a profile including data on individual preferences and or interests of the user and the significance of each preference and or interest for the user providing input data including content receiving a request of said user for displaying content and selectively displaying filtered content to said user in response to said request wherein said filtered content is displayed in accordance with the profile of said user.

According to an embodiment the filtered content is displayed in accordance with a list of keywords and in accordance with the individual preferences and or interests of said user wherein the list of keywords is stored as part of the profile of said user on a central server of said social network. According to the present disclosure the content which is selectively displayed to the user is controlled by means of settings stored in the individual profile of the respective user such as individual preferences and or interests of the respective user or information encoding such individual preferences and or interests.

According to a further embodiment the step of setting said list of keywords comprises displaying a graphical representation of said list of keywords on a graphical user interface GUI of an electronic device operated by said user wherein the graphical representation indicates the significance of said keywords and the connection of said keywords with other keywords included in said list of keywords modifying the significance and or connection of said keywords in response to input data of said user such as navigational input data of user navigational interactions on said graphical user interface to thereby obtain a modified list of keywords including the keywords and the respective significance and or connection associated with these keywords and storing said modified list of keywords as part of the profile of said user on a central server of said social network. Hence the selective filtering of the content displayed to the user is accomplished by means of a graphical representation of the individual preferences and or interests of the respective user and by means of modifying this graphical representation by means of a suitable user input. That user input may be obtained by means of a classical data input mask for inputting and or modifying text information. Preferably however the user input is derived from user interaction with the graphical user interface by means of a pointing device such as a mouse stylus or finger touch on a touch sensitive display said pointing device modifying the position significance and or connection of graphical representations of the respective keywords e.g. by modifying the size or color or other graphical feature of a graphical representation of the respective keywords wherein the size or color or other graphical feature of a graphical representation encodes the significance individual weight of the respective keywords or moving the graphical representation of a keyword to a different location relative to the locations of the other keywords included in the list of keywords wherein the distance between keywords encodes the connection strength between the keywords involved.

According to another embodiment the graphical representation of said list of keywords is displayed as a separate window of said GUI upon activation of a menu button of said GUI. Hence by opening the dedicated window for setting or adjusting the individual list of keywords the selective filtering of content displayed to the user can be modified in a simple manner transparent to the user.

According to another embodiment the filtered content is displayed in a central display area of the GUI wherein the menu button is persistently displayed at a periphery of the central display area of said graphical user interface wherein if the dedicated menu button is activated the graphical representation of the list of keywords is displayed in a separate window of the graphical user interface and the user can navigate in this separate window for setting or adjusting the individual list of keywords. Preferably graphical user input and or gestures are used for the purpose of setting or adjusting the individual list of keywords. According to this embodiment the user can repeatedly change between a window for displaying the graphical representation of the modified list of keywords and the window for displaying the modified filtered content the main window of the social network website .

The users may use a computing device such as a laptop or desktop computer a smart phone a personal digital assistant PDA a set top box and so forth to access the social network engine. The users can view data about social network members enter data about themselves and possibly others join social network groups view content on a GUI and so forth. The users are typically members of a social networking website associated with the social network engine.

When being connected to the social network a user such as the user can identify one or more other members associated with the social network engine as friends such as user . Friends will usually share similar preferences and or interests and such relationships can be established based on user input e.g. when a user explicitly appoints another member of the social network as a friend based e.g. on similar preferences or interests as determined based on individual preferences input by the two users. As an alternative such relationships can be established based on user interaction with the social network and as a result of a proposal generated automatically by the social network and sent as a message to two users asking them for confirmation whether the respective other user shall be a friend. Such a proposal can be made by the social network engine based on an automatic search in the preferences and or interests stored in the social network engine for preferences and or interests of two users matching with each other suitably well.

The relationship between users of the social network may be confirmed based on the input by the social network engine. Alternatively the existence of the relationship may be denied according to some embodiments. Any type of confirmation and or input may be utilized to alter deny and or establish the relationship between users.

All the above input data may be associated with certain keywords describing the event. Such keywords may concisely categorize the content purpose place length etc. of the event or categorize any action involved in the event. These keywords may be used later for filtering input data content and for selectively displaying filtered content on a display of a user.

Of course instead of or in addition to words the phrase keyword as used herein may involve other kinds of data that may be used to categorize content. As will be explained in the following in more detail such keywords may be explicitly input by users may be automatically generated or proposed based on an analysis of the input data or may be proposed by the system and used if accepted by a prompted user or if in accordance with the individual preferences and or interests of a user.

According to embodiments of the present disclosure content may also be associated with time tags which are either automatically generated while monitoring events or which are generated by user interaction. Such time tags enable the sorting of a plurality of events in chronological order as a prerequisite for displaying selected ones of these events in chronological order.

The aforementioned input data may be stored in a database of the social network engine usually together with the keywords and the associated time tags.

As shown in the system further comprises a data filter engine which filters the aforementioned input data content or any data derived from these input data or content and transferred from the data input engine. This data filter will usually be located on the side of the provider of the social network as part of the social network engine but may in principle also be located on the side of the user. As shown in the data filter engine is fed with user preferences and or interests possibly also with user selections in accordance with the individual list of keywords interest cloud as outlined below. According to the present disclosure this individual list of keywords encodes specific preferences and or interests of a user and might also be fed with proposals for filters e.g. in the case where a sponsored subscriber of the social network wishes to promote a new video game and thus causes the social network engine to propose all users of the social network or selected ones of these users to add certain preferences and or interests to the personal profile of the user in order to increase his or her interest on video games in general or an a specific video game in particular.

Finally as shown in the data filter engine may also be fed with so called social data as the result of interactions of users of the social network or of subgroups thereof such as communities. According to the present disclosure such social data can modify the individual list of keywords interest cloud of a user. As an example if the total number or percentage of users showing interest in a new video game either explicitly e.g. by mentioning the name of the new video game when being prompted for such input or implicitly e.g. as the result of user interactions e.g. when the users click on a link or icon associated with the new video game exceeds a certain threshold the social network engine may propose all users of the social network or selected ones of these users to add certain preferences and or interests to the personal profile of the user in order to increase his or her interest in the new video game. These proposals may either be accepted by the prompted users by means of a confirmative action such as clicking on a YES button or may be accepted automatically depending on the individual user profile or on the regulations of the provider of the social network.

As shown in the content e.g. the aforementioned input data is filtered by the data filter engine in accordance with the user specific interest cloud i.e. a list of preferences and or interests of the respective user. As an example if the input data include data relating to video game events and political events but the individual preferences and or interests of a user indicate that the particular user is highly interested in video games but not at all in political events all or most of the data relating to the political events is filtered out and only data relating to video games are passed through the data filter engine for display on the display of the user.

For implementing the above functionality a social network engine may include the components shown in although the present disclosure shall not be delimited to only those components shown in . More specifically the social network engine may include a communication interface for handling communication and exchange of data of the user with the social network engine or with other users of the social network a social relationship editor module which serves in particular for assigning other users of the social network as friends and for monitoring and analyzing the whole data traffic in the social network for identifying candidate new friends for specific users e.g. based on the past user interaction in the social network a relationship storage module for storing data representing these assigned or candidate relationships a module for driving a user GUI a user history analyzer for monitoring and analyzing the interaction of a specific user or of all users of the social network or of subgroups thereof such as communities a content feed generator and a display module configured for providing a display of the user s electronic device with relevant data e.g. filtered content in the sense of the present application.

As set forth above a user may specify individual preferences and or interests when using and navigating the social network. The term individual preferences and or interests in the sense of the present application shall comprise all suitable criteria and data for reliably identifying individual preferences interests dispositions favorites long time user behavior etc. of a specific user when exploring the social network. These individual preferences and or interests may be input explicitly by the user by means of the web oriented input mask as shown in presenting a variety of options to a user to set or adjust his or her individual preferences and or interests when interacting with the social network. It will be apparent that the input mask shown in serves only as one example that shall not be construed to delimit the scope of the present application. According to the present application these individual preferences and or interests may however also be input implicitly or automatically in the background as outlined below in more detail.

More specifically for selecting and adjusting his or her individual preferences and or interests in the individual list of keywords interest cloud the social network engine may present an input mask as shown in e.g. when clicking on a menu button PREFERENCE SETTING . Under this menu item the input mask presents a list of topics TOPIC . . . TOPIC N which may be pre selected topics pre defined by the provider of the social network which list may however also be the result of some kind of background computation e.g. based on the list of preferred topics of friends with whom the specific user is already connected. As an example these topics may include FRIENDS ACTIVITIES GAMES RESULTS OF ONLINE GAMING EVENTS COMMUNITY NEWS and the like. As shown in this list may further include so called sponsored topics SPONSORED TOPIC . . . SPONSORED TOPIC N which may be topics pre defined by the provider of the social network e.g. because of commercial interests of the provider such as advertisement and promoting of goods of customers or affiliated companies. As shown in the list of topics may also include so called proposed topics PROPOSED TOPIC . . . PROPOSED TOPIC N which may be topics identified by the user history analyzer see as candidate topics of potential interest to a specific user based e.g. on the recent user interactions of the user in the social network or identified by the social relationship editor module as candidate topics of potential interest to a specific user based e.g. on the friends with whom the specific user is connected to in the social network relationship significance . Of course the user history analyzer of the social network engine shown in may also identify certain topics as candidate topics of potential interest to a specific user based on the overall user behavior of all users of the social network or subgroups thereof such as communities. As an example if the user history analyzer determines that a significant percentage of the users click on websites about specific topics or if the user history analyzer determines that a significant percentage of those users that have defined a specific topic as a topic of preference and or interest subgroup click on websites about this specific topic then the social network engine may propose such topics as proposed topics in the input mask shown in . The individual user may then be prompted to confirm whether he or she wishes to add this proposed topic or interest to his or her list of individual preferences and or interests community significance .

As shown in the user has options to add to and remove such topics preferences and or interests from his or her individual list at any time. The user may also subscribe to data feeds about certain preferred topics. E.g. the user may wish that a news feed with news about new video games is automatically scanned in accordance with his or her individual preferences and or interests and that candidate new topics of interests are either proposed in the input mask shown in in the manner as outlined above or even automatically added to his or her individual list of preferences and or interests.

As shown in the user may also decide that certain or all preferences and or interests included in his or her individual list are linked and or shared with other users of the social network or even with users who are not members of the social network or that such preferences and or interests are hidden from and not shared with other users of the network or as an alternative hidden from and not shared with specific selectable other users or friends with whom the individual user is connected .

As shown in when operating the input mask the user may also assign or re adjust so called weights to selected ones of the above topics. In the sense of the present application the term weight refers to any kind of variable or computational parameter suited to indicate the significance of a respective preference and or interest to the individual user which variable or parameter may be used to attribute a higher significance to such topics preferences and or interests when filtering the input data. As an example a user may decide that the topic GAMES and NEWS ABOUT NEW GAMES is of high significance whereas the topic COMMUNITY NEWS is of almost zero importance to the user. In such a case the user may assign e.g. a high significance parameter in accordance with a uniform scale to the favorite topics GAMES and NEWS ABOUT NEW GAMES and a significance parameter of almost zero to the not preferred topic COMMUNITY NEWS. All this may be set or adjusted as specifically desired by the individual user at any time when exploring the social network.

If applicable the user may add remove or change any of the above topics preferences and or interests or assign or re adjust desired weights to such topics.

As shown in the user may also set or adjust the graphical representation for each of the above topics. As an example the user may decide that all events relating to video games are shown as circles in the user s individual timeline accompanied by an icon showing a representative image of the video game such as the trademark or most important character of the game and that all events relating to the user s personal activities such as appointments or conferences in the social network are shown as squares in the user s individual timeline accompanied by an icon showing a representative image of the respective activity e.g. a frog symbol relating to online chats and a mouse symbol for shared online game events.

As shown in a list of second order subtopics may be attributed to each of the above topics SUBTOPIC . . . SUBTOPIC N each subtopic may be added or removed and specific weights may be attributed to each of these subtopics or re adjusted. Furthermore additional nodes may be added which relate to the generic term for attributing one or more third order subtopic s to a specific second order subtopic.

It is noted that the Hide Do not share button shown in may be used for hiding a certain category of content in accordance with the set individual preferences and or interests of a user on the display of the user but may also be hidden on the displays of other users of the social network such as users which are connected with the user and with which the user generally shares the same or similar matching interests. In this manner a complex interest cloud as an individual list of keywords representing all preferences and or interests of an individual user may be built up as explained in more detail in the following.

More specifically the interest cloud is a defined space of explicit and implicit preferences and or interests shown e.g. as weighted keywords that reflect the individual preferences and or interests of a specific user or a specific group of users towards content news blogs media games people activities sponsored content ads files pages etc. . The interest cloud itself is updated based on the behavior of the user the system may implicitly weight keywords based on frequency of interaction of associated content and or the user directly and explicitly adding or removing keywords and increasing or reducing the weight of such keywords based on the user s degree of interest in the manner as set forth above with reference to . The user can re weight edit modify delete or perform other changes also on implicit keywords from the system to further refine the user s interest cloud. Context keywords are added or layered upon the existing interest cloud to maximize the correct representation of the user s true interests.

The interest cloud will mainly be used in online networks such as web communities and content portals but is not limited to these.

The purpose of the cloud is to give the user s an easy to understand user controlled and manageable representation of his their interests towards content. As a secondary use the self managed interest cloud gives content producers i.e. bloggers advertisers manufacturers communities a higher hit ratio and content will be more accepted by the users if the content is actually in the interest of the recipient.

The interest cloud provides the server with information about keywords the user is or might be interested in depending on the user s direct interaction with the keywords implicit keywords and contextual keywords. In other words an interest cloud is a combination of user defined keywords auto keywords and context based keywords that help the user to organize his interests.

Content the user has already marked as interesting to me will be part of his personal interest cloud by either becoming a keyword itself or by the system deriving keywords from that content. The system creates these implicit keywords by filtering the user s entered profile data tracking his interaction with content and noting the data of other users he is connected to as well as users with similar interest cloud s . This is not an exhaustive list other methods can also be used to collect and predict implicit interest for the interest cloud.

In addition the user or users may explicitly define keywords in the interest cloud by weighting their significance to him or her.

The user s context if available also adds keywords with weighting and significance to the interest cloud. This can include examples such as geographic position for instance being in a music shop in France being in a movie theater being in a restaurant .

The interest cloud contains keywords that stand for certain content information or activities and any other possible items preferences and or interests . For instance a keyword can be politics news and link to news about politics in general another can target a single subcategory of news such as local politics or news politics home country. Other keywords could be music tracks video files pictures persons characters events and more.

Any keyword can theoretically link to any other keywords creating links between products persons files etc. and in any wanted granularity. Thus any keyword is always in the context of its similar keywords. Context and similarity is partly defined by the system and partly defined by the active creation of new contexts by the user. It is up to the user to control their interest cloud directly or indirectly explicitly or implicitly . Each personal interest cloud also influences the overall context i.e. if a lot of users connect to keywords manually together that had not been previously connected by the system the general context or default connection will be updated too.

Every user can express multiple interest clouds having a main interest cloud about the high level content he is interested in as well as interest clouds for specific content types people activities and more. Depending on the sub pages and content box the community or network provides a sub interest cloud that is focused on the specific interests for that sub page content box or category.

Example User A is not interested in news in general thus he doesn t include news in his main interest cloud. But when it comes to music he is very interested in news about his favorite bands. His main interest cloud doesn t contain any news but his music sub group is concerned with everything about his favorite bands including news.

Likewise it is possible that the main interest cloud defines a user s interest in News and has sub interest clouds focused around topics such as music cars etc. In this case the main interest cloud is given hierarchy over the sub interest clouds and hence influences the overall content that is provided to the user.

Each keyword in the interest cloud has its own weighting and significance attached to it. This reflects how important the item is to the user. The graphical representation of each keyword in the interest cloud reflects this weighting and significance in a unique manner that may also be adjusted individually in accordance with the needs and preference of the individual user. As an example the significance of each keyword may be indicated by means of the font size e.g. a bigger keyword shows a higher degree of importance and a smaller keyword may show a lower degree of importance but the present disclosure is of course not limited to this kind of display. Other means to display significance could be e.g. by means of color coding numbers associated with the keywords and the like.

The interest cloud s of the user enables the server social network engine to process the interest cloud in order to provide each user with a higher relevancy of web content media files and people in an ordered prioritized and organized way.

The interest cloud of any user may also be created dynamically based upon the profile information the user added to his or her individual profile and by the user s online behavior. This automatic creation and changes afterwards reflects the interests of the user expressed in an implicit way.

The user can also provoke the system to propose implicit keywords based on existing keywords. For example if the user adds restaurants as a keyword to his interest cloud this triggers the system to suggest related keywords that might also interest him. These could include fast food restaurants exotic restaurants restaurants near my location restaurants my friends like etc. Such proposals may be made based on some kind of expert system that e.g. knows or learns from a user s behavior in the past that it is highly likely that a user might also be interested in certain subtopics e.g. exotic restaurant if he or she is interested in a certain main topic e.g. restaurant .

Real time context specific keywords may also be added dynamically such as geographic context being in a city country a shop a restaurant and other contexts such as but not limited to being in winter or in a particular week of the year . This lets the system retrieve content organized with the help of the user s interest cloud to ensure that is relevant to the context the user is in.

The user can also add reprioritize change and delete any explicit and implicit keywords inside his interest cloud on any level. He or she can also enable or disable reprioritize change and delete context specific keywords thus changing the interest cloud manually in any way needed to tailor it to his satisfaction and his context. This may be performed by operating the input mask described with reference to but may also be performed directly in a graphical representation of the individual interest cloud as outlined below.

The complete interest cloud of a user may be organized in layers. There is e.g. one main interest cloud and an open number of special interest clouds. The amount of clouds may depend on the actual amount of interests the user creates in his profile.

The main interest cloud of every user contains the most important interest keywords preferences and or interests the user has on a broad level. Interests of the main cloud apply to all special interest clouds. For example if the user is interested in music in general the news interest cloud will include news about music by default as the system implies that this might be in the interest of the user too.

The special interest cloud contains all interests a user has in a specific part of the cloud e.g. all interests about games. By default the special cloud is derived from the main interest cloud but it can be altered as described above. As the interest cloud is a constantly changing network of interests linked to each other the size and granularity of the cloud is highly dependent on the user s behavior.

The interest cloud is stored as a network of keywords. The interest cloud is stored in several levels e.g. main cloud sub clouds is linked to a user or group and is stored as part of their main profile on the server social network engine and is therefore available for the user anywhere when accessing his profile. A user s interest cloud will be stored alongside his profile for as long as that profile exists and can be modified by the user at any time.

For displaying a graphical representation of the interest cloud in the way the cloud functions in the background according to the present application the items may be displayed in different groupings and styles e.g. the size of a respective interest may indicate the significance attributed to the respective interest . Thus the user can quickly identify his major interests and how the other items are connected to each other.

Examples for the graphical representation of such an interest cloud and how these graphical representations are modified will be explained in the following referring to . It is noted that the following shall not be construed as delimiting the scope of the present disclosure.

Implicit system created interest keywords within the cloud have a distinguishable look compared to the explicit keywords. This differentiation includes but is not limited to color coding different font size or the annotation of the keyword with symbols e.g. musicgroupname.

Context created interest keywords within the interest cloud have a distinguishable look compared to the explicit and implicit keywords. This differentiation may include but is not limited to color coding different font size or the annotation of the keyword with symbols or additional characters e.g. c paris c restaurant.

In keywords . . . in black letters indicate explicit keywords i.e. keywords preferences and or interests explicitly input by the user e.g. by using the input mask of . Keywords . . . enclosed by dashed ovals in indicate implicit keywords. In the example the location of the user while exploring the social network is detected by means of the user history analyzer see and communicated to the social network engine which then proposes candidate keywords such as foreign restaurants daily news in my area or my actively played games which may then either be accepted confirmed by the user or rejected. This is one example of context based data.

In keywords enclosed by a dotted oval indicate implicit keywords added based on location based data. As an example the geographical location of the user s mobile electronic device is continuously detected and communicated to the social network engine which then based on an expert system proposes candidate keywords of potential interest to the user such as Japanese restaurant around my current location if the system knows that the user has a certain interest in Japanese food e.g. based on the selection and significance of the topic Favorite Japanese restaurant in the list of keywords preferences and or interests of the individual user.

In keywords enclosed by a dashed and dotted oval indicate explicit keywords added by a different user of the social network such as a friend connected to the user. As an example if both users share the interest of enjoying movies the second user or as an alternative the social network engine may propose to the first user to add the item new movies this week to his interest cloud. The first user can be made aware of this proposal because this proposal may be clearly marked for example by means of color encoding explicit keywords added by a different user. The exclamation mark in the interest cloud or any other suitable graphical symbol indicates that the new explicit keyword needs to be confirmed before it will be added as a real effective keyword to the individual interest cloud of the first user. Of course if the first user should reject not confirm the proposed keyword it will finally disappear or become inactive in his individual interest cloud. As an alternative the proposed keyword may become active effective if the user should not operate the proposed keyword during a given time period.

In the question mark or any other suitable graphical symbol indicates that the new implicit keyword needs to be confirmed before it will be added as a real effective keyword to the individual interest cloud of the first user. Of course if the first user should reject not confirm the proposed keyword it will disappear or become inactive in his individual interest cloud. As an alternative the proposed keyword may become active effective if the user should not operate the proposed keyword during a given time period.

As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art instead of changing or re adjusting the individual preferences or interests in an input mask such as that shown in and explained above the user may of course also grasp certain keywords in the interest cloud shown in and move or manipulate these keywords as desired to thereby establish new user specific preferences and or interests. As an example by dragging the keyword News about my friends from the left hand side of the interest cloud towards the right hand upper part of the interest cloud i.e. near the keyword Japan new links between keywords may be established linking e.g. news about all those friends of the user that are interested in the topic Japan to thereby establish a link between these friends and the topic Japan. This is an example of a graphics oriented modification of the interest cloud.

The interest cloud described above is one example of how an interest cloud works. The example may use different colors and dashed lines to show the status of the different keywords. For example all black keywords may be edited by the user and all keywords enclosed by a dashed line or represented with a green color may be implicit and added by the system as suggestions to the user based on his interests. A dotted line or blue color may also represent an implicit keyword but may be added based on the current location of the user. Keywords represented in red color or enclosed by dashed and dotted lines may be a suggestion by a friend of the user.

Question marks in the above example show where new additions are made by the system that the user might want to edit. They are an optional feature to highlight changes in the interest cloud. Exclamation marks are similar as they also wait for confirmation but were added explicitly by a friend of the user and thus have a different quality to the interest cloud.

Of course different graphical representations of the interest cloud may be utilized implying different graphical encodings for relationships and functionality. One example for such an alternative graphical representation is shown in where the different sizes of graphical symbols or circles indicate the weights attributed to specific keywords displayed in the interest cloud.

As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art many different styles of graphical representations may be utilized for displaying the individual keywords preferences and or interests of an individual user.

With reference to a method for modifying an interest cloud such as that shown in will be described in more detail. In the rectangular boxes show comments explaining in brief what is shown in the respective left hand part of the respective drawing.

As shown in the upper part step S based on the user s interaction the system has added an implicit keyword my favorite bands which may be indicated in green letters to symbolize a suggestion added by the system to suggest a new keyword to the user and linked with the respective top level keyword music news by a dashed line ending in small dots.

As shown in step S if a user highlights this suggestion e.g. by activating a special purpose button or by simply navigating onto the suggested implicit keyword several options pop up for a further selection by the user such as delete implicit keyword add implicit keyword and expand implicit keyword as shown in step S . The options add and delete cause the suggested implicit keyword to be added or deleted from the interest cloud.

If the user selects the option expand as shown in step S the expand symbol is highlighted in this example by hatching of the option symbol and further options pop up as a suggestion to and for selection by the user namely specific band names band to band as shown in step S

In response the user may select some of these suggestions e.g. in this example band and band . These graphical symbols are also highlighted in this example by hatching of the option symbol as shown in step S and the sub keywords selected namely band and band are added to the interest cloud of the user.

Finally the interest cloud is modified and displayed as shown in step S with the suggested and selected new sub keywords band and band indicated in the same manner as those keywords already included in the list of keywords namely in black solid letters and with black colored interconnection lines. In this way a modified list of keywords modified interest cloud is generated which is then used in the future for selectively filtering content and displaying the filtered content in accordance with the modified interest cloud on the display of the user.

Changing keywords implicit and explicit is the same for the user. Depending on the keyword several options can present themselves such as delete add move expand etc. . The system can suggest new keywords to add show other ways to connect existing keywords to the cloud to improve the overview or lead the user to new activities based on the keyword. For example as shown in table above the newly added bands can provoke new implicit keywords that can link to the online shop so the user can buy the music of these specific bands.

If the user navigates onto the suggested implicit keyword further options may pop up as shown in step S such as Keep you updated Yes and Keep you updated No as shown.

More specifically the user James to which the first user is connected e.g. via similar interests in the individual profiles of both users matching with each other or via a friends function or button of the social network suggests new movies this week as an implicit keyword to the first user. This suggestion for an implicit keyword is cross hatched in step S . If the first user navigates on this new implicit keyword an option pops up in the interest cloud as shown in step S namely add interest to cloud Yes No. If the user selects the option YES shown in step S the hatching or color of the new keyword may change to indicate an implicit keyword suggested by the system and added to the interest cloud and the link between New movies this week and friend James is deactivated separated and the link between New movies this week and the keyword Entertainment News which is already included in the interest cloud of the user is set as shown in step S . As shown in step S once the user has accepted the new keyword the system may now propose another implicit keyword such as movie theater s near my location based on the location of the user. In this way an interest cloud in accordance with the specific needs or profile of the user of the social network or other data may be built up and updated.

As will become apparent from the above it will usually be preferable that a user can only control his own interest cloud and can not directly control the clouds of other users although a user may influence the cloud of others by e.g. making suggestions. Suggestions by other users be they trusted friends or advertising companies are marked as such and can be accepted or rejected. Both choices are stored and will influence future suggestions to the cloud. In some embodiments suggestions are not targeted towards specific users. A suggestion is like any other added interest keyword with information as to who might be interested in it.

In the example of the user s friend James added a keyword new movies this week to his cloud with the context that this is something he wants to share with his friends. As the first user is also interested in entertainment news he adds this new keyword to his interest cloud.

As will become apparent from the above users such as vendors or manufacturers or game publishers as in the example above can add keywords to for instance media content e.g. a trailer for a new product in order to inform fans about the coming product. The added content is automatically connected to users who might be interested in the product. These users may be identified by scanning through the profiles of all users of the social network and identifying those users having keywords in their interest cloud which match with the implicit keyword proposed by the system in accordance with the product. When displayed to the user his keyword can be accepted or rejected by the user which in the process tells the system that he wants to get more on the topic in the future or not.

The goal of future content is to link the content to the user ahead of time. This serves as a reminder and also delivers personally relevant information to the user.

Referring to the data filter engine receives input data DATA IN in various different ways and from various different sources as outlined above in particular as explained with reference to above.

The received or input data may include a time tag indicating the exact date of some kind of event in the future present or past. Preferably once a datum e.g an event is associated with a time tag the time tag is either in a pre defined data format or the existence of the time tag is indicated by a flag or similar indication in the datum enabling a quick and simple search for such time tags and further processing. As an example a user may enter data information about an event together with time information about the exact date and possibly also time duration of the event and according to the present disclosure the data about the event and the time information time tag are linked with each other.

The input data are then further processed. As an example the input data may be stored in a database accessible by all or selected users of a social network via the social network. Or the input data may be associated with various kinds of keywords and stored in a database of the social network thus enabling a quick and simple categorization of the data in accordance with e.g. individual user preferences and or interests. Or the data may be sorted in chronological order in accordance with the time history given by the time tags associated with the data. The data may then be stored in the database in this chronological order. Or the social network engine generates a link to the event and some keyword information about the event that will be sent to the individual user later instead of transmitting all detailed information about the event. By clicking on the link or icon the user may then retrieve information about the event only if needed to save computing time and transmission bandwidth otherwise. As will become apparent to the person skilled in the art the input data can be further processed in many different ways.

Once a user is logged in to a social network a request for data is generated by the user requesting content data from the social network engine such as his personal news data information about news in the social network new messages and notifications in the social network for the user or other content. The data filter engine then selects sorts out all those data in accordance with user specific preferences and or interests as entered into the individual list of keywords interest cloud of the user and presents these data to the user DATA OUT . In this regard the data filter engine shown in may filter the input data or as an alternative data stored for the user in a data storage in accordance with the individual preferences and or interests interest cloud of the user possibly also in accordance with additional data such as user selection data proposals for filters or social data see and enables access to these data by the specific user. This does not exclude of course that also other data may be provided to the user. However those input data that are selected in accordance with the individual preferences and or interests of the specific user are treated or transmitted with higher priority for the specific user. The filtered data content are then displayed on the display of the user s electronic device of which one example embodied as a smart phone is shown in .

As shown in the user s mobile electronic device comprises a display for displaying content. As shown in the smart phone has a touch sensitive display with sliders on the right hand side and bottom rim for sliding scrolling the display area as desired. The display displays content as indicated by the schematic lines in the central area of the display. Furthermore the display displays several buttons INTEREST CLOUD NEWS MARKETPLACE GENERAL TOPICS which if activated cause a new window to be opened on the display. If the button INTEREST CLOUD is activated e.g. when touched the user s interest cloud is opened and displayed as outlined above. If the button NEWS is activated a new window is opened which displays news which is filtered in accordance with the interest cloud of the user. As an example if the interest cloud includes the preferences and interests of the interest cloud shown in in the news windows news relating to the preferred topics entertainment news general news music news and news about my friends will be displayed with preference taking into consideration also the sub keywords such as daily news in my area and the like.

As will become apparent the user may switch between the interest cloud window and any other window repeatedly. Any modification of the interest cloud will have a corresponding influence on any function for displaying content such as displaying news.

As an example of how the filtering of content based on the user s specific interest cloud may have an influence on the content actually displayed on the user s display reference is made to in the following. schematically shows the display of a user after creating a first interest cloud of his specific preferences and or interests. Based on this interest cloud certain settings for filtering content are used to combine the content to build up the display of which includes six fields for advertising as schematically indicated by the crossed out boxes labled to . For instance the user may add the keyword Paris to his interest cloud indicating e.g. that he is interested in topics about the city of Paris. Then in accordance with the other keywords of the user the filtered content is generated including the advertisements to . 

If the same user modifies his interest cloud this may result in a different filtering of content and selection of advertisements as indicated by the crossed out boxes and in . It is noted that some of the advertisements selected by the system for the particular user may be the same but that the order in which these advertisements are displayed to the user is modified in accordance with the updated interest cloud of the user. Of course may also show the display of another user having a different interest cloud different preferences and or interests . Of course the crossed out boxes in may be representative for any content data to be displayed on the user s display.

As will become apparent to the person skilled in the art the method according to the present disclosure provides added visibility of relation to activities events content and people which collectively can be referred to as moments and the visualization of the dynamic significance changes the timeline into an easy to use productive social life tool when using social networks.

While various embodiments have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. For example any of the elements associated with the social network engine may employ any of the desired functionality set forth hereinabove. Thus the breadth and scope of the claimed subject matter should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments.
