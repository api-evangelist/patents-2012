abstract: A set top box or like device incorporating an untrusted software framework as a client of a secure operating system kernel. The software framework may comprise, for example, an Android framework supported by an underlying Linux operating system environment having a secure kernel. The software framework can be executed using a variety of process isolation techniques depending on performance and isolation requirements. A secure access client/server interface may also be provided to support interactions between the untrusted software framework (and applications utilizing the untrusted software framework) and secure or trusted portions of the device. The secure access interface can be configured to perform operations such as handle validation, heap pointer validation, non-pointer parameter validation, heap isolation, and resource release relating to terminated processes. In further embodiments, a software framework aggregator is used to support a plurality of additional software frameworks for use in the set top box.

The present invention relates generally to processing systems and more particularly to secure integration of an untrusted framework or pathway and a secure operating system environment in devices such as a set top box.

Attempts to accommodate relatively untrusted software applications or frameworks in certain types of devices may complicate applicable certification processes that are performed in accordance with one or more industry defined certification standards or testing procedures. For example vendor certification of many set top boxes used by cable operators is conducted via rigid certification processes that test interoperability and security compliance for devices that implement specifications such as DOCSIS PacketCable CableHome and OpenCable . Successful certification of such devices typically requires full end to end security. Likewise digital rights management DRM and other technologies implemented in a particular device or component such as a system on a chip may require distinct certification processes which do not allow certain interactions with an unsecured operating system OS environment or software framework.

In general any unsecured portions of a media pathway in a set top box or like device if not isolated will cause the certification of such pathway to fail. Most conventional set top boxes are designed to provide a single secure and certified pathway through the various elements of the device. In some recent multi processor set top boxes a conventional certified pathway is separated from untrusted components by creating a hardware boundary between the two. In particular a first processing module is utilized to provide secure functionality e.g. decoding operations while a separate processing module with a lower security level is used to support an untrusted framework.

As is known a software framework may provide application programming interface functionality and services that are not offered by an underlying operating system and may thereby offer a level of platform independence in certain implementations. Frameworks are often designed to be a reusable and adaptable software system or subsystem. For example Android has become one of the fastest growing operating systems frameworks for mobile devices. Android which builds on contributions from the open source Linux community provides development tools and reusable components for building applications that can be deployed across many different types of devices such as a smartphone or tablet device.

A typical Android framework is a multi user Linux based system in which each Android application is a different user having code that runs in general isolation from other applications. Such process isolation or application sandbox provides a certain level of security. However various components processes threads etc. used by an application may not entail sufficient protection when integrated in a set top box type device resulting in Android being considered an untrusted framework when used in such devices. For example an application that visits an arbitrary web page or receives code from an unverified third party may result in untrusted JavaScript code being executed on a set top box possibly with elevated privileges. Such code might exploit weakness in other code e.g. browser code and receive unauthorized access to file systems etc. thereby compromising the security of a device exposing protected data or introducing system instability.

As indicated above the processing unit of some devices may have multiple processors or processing cores in order to provide higher performance and or multi tasking capabilities. In some of these multi processor systems when multiple applications or programs are running access control is typically needed to separate the functionality of the applications running on multiple processors. Separation or segregation of different applications and or tasks running on different processors helps to ensure that one application does not interfere with the execution of another. Likewise data assigned to one processor should not be accessed by another processor unless that data is shared between the two processors. Such separation is typically handled through use of virtual memory with each process having a unique view of memory that is not accessible from outside processes. Hardware access can be handled through a kernel or device driver interface which provides some level of security. Even in a multi processor system in which one processor environment provides trusted or secure operations while another operates in an unsecure or restricted environment however there can be a substantial possibility of an incursion from the unsecure zone into the secure zone when the operating system is managing the separation.

For example in a set top box that allows a user to receive television signals and also allows the user to access the Internet the secure environment may run applications including a secure set top box application pertaining to the reception decryption and display of certain channels or content provided by a cable or satellite provider or other service operator. The unsecure environment in the set top box may execute applications such as Android based applications that allow a user to access the Internet for web browsing gaming etc. In this example the content provider would generally not want the user or anyone else to access the applications pertaining to broadcast or premium channels. However if there is commonality in software that controls the accesses to both environments such as running the same operating system to manage accesses in both environments then there may be a heightened risk of access violations. Such violations whether intentional or non intentional could result in an unsecure breach into the secure applications of the set top box such as a web originated intrusion into protected television channels.

Accordingly there is a need to obtain an efficient way to integrate untrusted frameworks framework components and applications with a secure operating system environment such as that of a set top box device.

While certain embodiments are described in conjunction with an Android framework and or Linux operating system other embodiments of the present invention may be practiced with a variety of current or future operating systems kernels and frameworks and employ a variety of computing circuits devices servers and or systems that might utilize multiple processors processing cores and or processing circuits. Further certain of the illustrations herein describe a processing module a processor or a CPU e.g. CPU CPU for a device that provides a processing function in the described embodiments. However it is appreciated that a variety of other devices and or nomenclature may be used in other embodiments to provide for the processing function in practicing the invention. The invention may be readily adapted to other usages where multiple processing environments zones domains etc. exist in which separation and or segregation between two or more zones is desired Likewise while certain embodiments are described as implemented by a set top box STB or like media processing device performing trusted media processing operations the novel architectures and methodologies are applicable in whole or in part to other devices including media consumption devices such as PVR s DVD players access points televisions computing devices smartphones etc.

As described more fully below a secure software abstraction layer is provided to isolate access to underlying software hardware and secure components of the device. Communications and data exchanges between the untrusted framework and secure OS kernel may occur via a secure access layer or interface comprised of a secure access client and secure access server that support an application programming interface API and secure inter process communication IPC calls or kernel drivers. In certain embodiments the secure access client may be part of or accessible by the framework while the secure access server is incorporated in a secure operating system environment or executed as a secure kernel module. In one embodiment the secure access interface may help prevent system breaches or destabilization resulting from bad data or parameters by performing without limitation parameter validation checking and peripheral range checking through hardware when applicable handle validation direct indirect heap pointer validation heap isolation and release of hardware resources following termination of a restricted process. In operation the secure access server may limit access to server side libraries and return errors in response to invalid or illegal parameters passed by clients. The secure access interface may further perform watchdog functions to free resources reserved by runaway or unstable clients.

As noted Android provides a component based framework for developing mobile applications. Each application may be comprised of differing numbers and types of components. By way of example such components can include Activity components that form the basis of a user interface where each screen presented to the user is a different Activity. Background processing is performed by Service components which also define arbitrary interfaces for communicating with other applications. Content Provider components function to share information in a relational database form while Broadcast Receiver components operate as an asynchronous mailbox for messages from the system and or other components.

An Android framework according to the disclosed embodiment may support varying degrees of collaboration and dependencies between applications. However the interfaces used by applications to provide services and communicate with other applications or an underlying operating system must be secured to defend against breaches and general malfeasance. By default applications in a typical Android framework do not have permission to perform operations that might negatively impact other system components such as reading or writing private data or another application s files performing network access etc. . Because Android essentially sandboxes applications from each other applications must explicitly share resources and data by declaring permissions needed for additional capabilities that are outside of the basic sandbox. For example an application may statically declare the permissions it requires and at the time of installation the Android framework may prompt a user for appropriate consents. As noted above in the Description of the Related Art and without rigid hardware isolation and separate execution environments the potential for execution of unauthorized code from an untrusted framework may compromise overall system security and negatively impact certification procedures for certain devices absent methodologies and architectures e.g. a secure access server such as those described herein.

Referring now to integration of an untrusted framework as a client of a secure operating system environment in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. The secure operating system environment can be incorporated in a secure device such as a set top box or other media processing consumption device . In this embodiment execution of the untrusted framework including components thereof as well as untrusted applications is performed by the secure operating system environment using process isolation techniques. Such process isolation techniques may entail for example utilizing virtual address space where the address space for a first process is different than that of a second process. Inter process memory access may be prohibited or tightly controlled in certain implementations e.g. where system policies permit processes to collaborate over IPC channels such as shared memory or local sockets .

Access to a secure or trusted root operating system such as Linux based operating system and or underlying hardware such as secure set top box hardware is provided via an access server operating in concert with an access client and a software abstraction layer API . In the illustrated embodiment a complete or partial Linux operating system instance including any necessary software patches is provided to support execution of the untrusted framework . The access client may further function to govern communications between the untrusted framework and the complete or partial Linux operating system instance . In addition the framework may include an API or one or more buttons that enable for example a visual display of available applications which may be executed on the untrusted framework using for example application IPC calls .

In certain embodiments user interfaces supported by the framework aggregator may enable a user to launch applications supported by the untrusted framework . For example an Android framework and or framework aggregator may offer a series of APIs or buttons including an Android button that provides a visual display of available Android applications. Further the Android framework and framework aggregator may share a graphics screen. In this manner it may not be necessary to port functionality into the Android framework that might otherwise be necessary. It is noted that in a given device an Android framework may be built using a different tool chain than that utilized by other frameworks supported by the framework aggregator and support execution of a different set of applications .

As described more fully in conjunction with the untrusted framework and the framework aggregator are supported in the illustrated set top box by an access server software abstraction layer API root Linux operating system underlying set top box hardware and a complete or partial Linux operating system instance including any necessary software patches . In the illustrated embodiment an access client enables secure communications between the untrusted framework and access server while the framework aggregator is similarly supported by an access client .

In addition to an access client the Android framework of the illustrated embodiment may include trusted certified and or untrusted applications and application support JavaScript interpretation browser functions plug ins e.g. an Adobe Flash plug in and a Dalvik virtual machine. In some embodiments certified applications may be downloaded from or supplied by a service operator content provider cloud based source or the like. The Android framework further includes platform or operating system access functionality that enables limited access to necessary components of the secure Linux kernel environment through a minimal guest Linux services access interface .

A variety of virtualization techniques may be employed in various embodiments according to the present disclosure including implementations utilizing virtual systems running on either a shared operating system kernel or separate operating system kernels. Selection of a particular approach may depend on the required level of isolation as well as availability of processing and memory resources. In the illustrated embodiment the untrusted Android framework is executed in a first virtual machine VM guest Linux container s such as an LXC or Linux resource container to provide further isolation from secure processes and resources. In this embodiment the STB application may similarly operate in a second VM host Linux container having full host Linux services access . Briefly and in general container based virtualization or operating system level virtualization allows a kernel to run with a plurality of isolated virtual machines or virtual environments installed on top of it. Each virtual environment may be dedicated to run a particular application and is typically not a complete operating system instance but rather a partial instance of the operating system that works with a virtualization layer or hardware resource abstraction layer in the host operating system kernel.

Although virtualization may mitigate the need for hardware separation of untrusted components in certain embodiments multiple processors having different levels of security may benefit from virtual container constructs which operate wholly via one of such processors while other containers may span multiple processors see for example the embodiment illustrated in . In one such embodiment a first processor s may be dedicated to execution of non secure functionality while a second secure processor s may be dedicated to conventional STB functionality. In various alternate embodiments an untrusted framework may be hardware sandboxed via for example non processor hardware peripherals memory isolation from processors and or peripherals etc. Various other divisions between secure and untrusted software and hardware are contemplated e.g. dividing an untrusted framework or applications themselves into a trusted portion and an untrusted portion examples of which are described below. Further by utilizing hardware and operating system virtualization features multiple operating systems may run simultaneously on the same hardware.

In some embodiments certain resources of a set top box platform such as media processing and hardware acceleration resources for audio video encoding and decoding rendering of 2D and 3D graphics using a standardized API such as Open Graphics Library or OpenGL DRM encryption decryption etc. and networking interfaces may be accessed by untrusted client applications frameworks through IPC calls communicated through network sockets Likewise events such as IR control signals may be communicated from a set top box platform to untrusted client applications frameworks through IPC calls such as a call into an Android API or button . In the illustrated embodiment a framework aggregator such as that described above may be employed to embrace and extend operation with a wide variety of frameworks.

In alternate embodiments a trusted portion s of a Android framework web browser etc. and a corresponding untrusted portion s are executed in one or more separate virtual machine containers. The trusted portion may include a secure platform and operating system access interface. Using an example involving a web browser the portion of the browser that executes potentially unsafe Flash or JavaScript code such as a rendering engine can be executed in the untrusted virtual machine container with limited file system and peripheral access while the portion of the browser that has access to underlying platform hardware and sensitive operating system resources can be executed in one or more trusted virtual machine containers. In further embodiments the trusted portion may comprise a secure clone of a framework or modified version of a framework that supports secure applications and or secure portions of applications. In such embodiments unsecure applications or portions thereof may be executed by portions of a framework residing in an untrusted or restricted user domain or container. Various approaches to process isolation and hardware sandboxing may be employed to further isolate untrusted portions of a framework and to support restricted operating system environments.

In further embodiments according to the disclosure a set top box or other secure architecture can utilize certified applications that are executable in a manner consistent with an industry standard certification process es . The certified applications may be preinstalled or downloaded for example from a catalog of certified applications provided by a service operator or cloud based source. Such applications might include by way of example media streaming applications e.g. Netflix gaming applications web browsing applications iOS based applications Android applications etc. In some embodiments it may be necessary to incorporate or download additional operating systems to support corresponding classes of certified applications. Alternatively different certified versions of a given application may be made available to support a variety of installed operating systems and or frameworks. Certified applications may be executed in one or more virtual machine containers.

In another exemplary embodiment a primary set top box application is constructed as an Android application executed in one or more virtual machine containers. As with frameworks the set top box application may be partitioned into a trusted portion s and an untrusted portion s . Depending on the capabilities of the underlying Android framework non standard API s or libraries may be required to support certain set top box functionality such as PVR picture in picture transcoding and channel tuning operations. Further this approach may require special interfacing e.g. passing a string to an interface to create an encode path as part of a hardware call or provision of non standard functions or even applications to address services and functions that may be lacking in a relevant framework or required for certification. For example an Android framework might be extended to include non standard functionality without negatively impacting compatibility by providing services that are hidden under the Android porting layers and receive and interpret uniform resource identifiers URIs passed through such layers.

In other embodiments instead of an end to end security definition being managed by the source or being defined by the content itself or associated metadata each application that is downloaded or preinstalled includes a full security definition. For example each application may have its own downloadable conditional access security dCAS or downloadable DRM element definition. A corresponding certification process might entail for example certifying a part of an overall secure pathway with one or more applications providing the final portion of the certification. Alternatively a predefined plurality of conditional access mechanisms may be provided with a downloaded application defining which mechanism is to be used. It may then be possible to certify a secure boundary without regard to the conditional access requirements of a particular company or media.

In various embodiments a set top box or like device may exchange capabilities with other devices in a media consumption network e.g. PVR s DVD players access points televisions computing devices smartphones etc. to compare against the requirements of an application. Once this is done the application may select which one or more modes of operation if any that it will permit. If the set top box cannot support such modes due to resource competition or otherwise such modes become unavailable. If available a set of modes of operation can be selected and dynamically switched to other of such modes on the fly during a media stream delivery which may require coordination with the application or the source to support the transition possibly requiring quality changes in the media stream .

In Linux a process generally refers to a task that is tracked by a kernel for execution. Processes in an operating system such as Linux may be isolated from other processes as well as the kernel . For example a process typically cannot access kernel memory. As is known Linux processes may also utilize multiple execution threads with each thread sharing the resources of the initiating process but having a separate instruction pointer.

In one embodiment the SMP Linux kernel can perform load balancing for processes in both virtual machines across multiple CPU threads or cores when maximum performance is desired. Further a host virtual machine with control of a guest virtual machine can terminate and restart a process in the guest virtual machine or the entire container if it misbehaves or is compromised. Hard limits can be placed on CPU utilization by a guest virtual machine in order to prevent disruption of core underlying device functionality and to facilitate termination of runaway processes. In operation separate threads may have segregated and or restricted access to an I D cache and L2 cache .

Referring more particularly to the figure the SMP Linux kernel functions to control hardware and lock a guest virtual machine s instance of Linux running certified and or untrusted applications and a host virtual machine s running trusted application core services to one or more separate threads based on performance and or security isolation requirements. For example an untrusted application might be executed in a virtual machine container that spans both CPU and CPU. As described more fully below various portions of I D caches and and L2 cache may be restricted to a particular thread or CPU or shared with appropriate safeguards.

In one embodiment CPU and CPU are both segregated into separate and distinct zones when in a sandboxing mode. In another embodiment the trusted CPU is set up having its own segregated regions of memory and also given access rights over some or all address ranges of memory mapped portions of CPU. Generally when operating in separate or segregated zones environments or domains the two CPUs operate on different applications so that CPU executes one set of instructions while CPU executes a different set of instructions. Segregation or separation of this nature is typically referred to as sandboxing or sandbox mode. The purpose of most sandboxing is to prevent one zone from accessing functionality in the other zone or to have controlled access of one zone into another. In some instances both zones may be limited from having access to the other zone or only have controlled access between zones. In some applications one zone may be regarded as a secure privileged or trusted zone and the other as a restricted non secure or non trusted zone in which access by the applications operating on the non secure zone are prevented or controlled from accessing certain applications running in the secure zone.

As noted above a number of devices utilize multiple processors or processing cores to run separate programs applications etc. In a situation where one zone is not to have access to a second zone one way to ensure this separation is by checking the accesses to the system memory. That is by ensuring accesses that are allocated to CPU are not accessed by CPU unless the location of the access is a shared location applications running on CPU may be prevented from breaching the functional separation. One way to achieve this protection is to provide an access check and access control to ensure that the correct processing module is accessing a permitted location for that processing module. In the illustrated embodiment CPU and CPU may communicate directly through a network socket IPC calls etc.

The STB gateway of the illustrated embodiment interacts with a residential network infrastructure and external media systems via one or more wired and wireless networks links. The wired and wireless networks links may utilize one or more of various transmission media such as coaxial cable shielded twisted pair cable fiber optic cable power line wires and wireless media radio frequencies microwave satellite infrared etc. and operate in accordance with a variety of communication and networking protocols TCP IP UPnP IPv6 etc. . In addition the wired and wireless networks links may comprise a multi hop network utilizing a spanning tree protocol direct wireless connections peer to peer links etc.

The external media systems may comprise for example one or more of cable satellite and or terrestrial televisions systems. Various headend equipment and services can be utilized by these systems such as a cable headend that receives television signals for further processing and distribution and may offer various other services such as internet connectivity and VoIP services.

The STB gateway of the illustrated embodiment includes a broadcast unicast multicast front end that operates to receive uncompressed or compressed digital video digital audio and other data signals from either the external media systems or residential network infrastructure for further processing and distribution. The front end comprises tuner circuitry operable to isolate particular channels. Signals from the tuner circuitry are then provided to analog to digital ADC circuitry and demodulation circuitry for conversion into binary format stream. Once in binary format forward error correction FEC circuitry checks the integrity of the received binary stream. Audio video and data extracted from the binary stream may then be decoded e.g. by decoding into formats suitable for consumption by downstream devices. It is noted that demodulation circuitry may support one or more modulation techniques such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing COFDM etc.

The front end may be integrated into one or more semiconductor devices that may further support for example interactive digital television networked DVR functionality IP video over DOCSIS applications and 3D graphics support. In addition multiple tuner circuitry including in band and out of band tuners ADC circuitry and demodulation circuitry may be provided for different modulation schemes and television standards such as PAL NTSC ATSC SECAM DVB C DVB T 2 DVB H ISDB T DMB Open Cable .

In one alternative embodiment of the disclosure functionality of the STB gateway is performed by a smartphone or mobile computing device. In this embodiment the front end comprises one or more wireless interfaces including PHY and baseband functions such as a cellular 3G 4G IMT Advanced etc. or wide area network HetNet Wi Fi WiMax etc. interface. The interface may support one or more modulation and multiplexing techniques such as OFDM OFDMA SC FDMA QPSK QAM 64QAM CSMA MIMO etc. In the illustrated embodiment the wireless interface comprises a transceiver analog to digital ADC and digital to analog DAC circuitry demodulation and modulation circuitry and FEC such as turbo codes or LDPC codes circuitry . Encoding decoding and transcoding functions may be provided by processing circuitry and storage .

The STB gateway also includes wide area network interface circuitry for communicating with residential network infrastructure and or external media system . Through the communication interface circuitry the STB gateway may communicate directly with upstream resources or offer bidirectional bridged communications between such resources and devices e.g. devices coupled to the STB gateway .

In the embodiment of STB gateway interacts with a variety of devices via communication interface circuitry . For example a television or display interface module communicates with a digital television or other media display device to relay television programming and enable available interactive media services. In certain embodiments the television or display interface module might include a remote user interface RUI server. Similarly an audio interface provides audio programming or audio library access to an audio system .

The communication interface circuitry further comprises a remote control interface for receiving control signals from a remote control . In addition to traditional remote control operations the remote control may further offer voice and or gesture control signals that are relayed or mapped to relevant consumer devices. User interfaces are also provided for communications with one or more user interface devices . Gaming interfaces function to provide interactive communications with a gaming system . Such communications may involve for example online multiplayer gaming between members of a social network and or external players in a gaming platform. Power management interface functionality is provided to enable power saving operations between devices .

The STB gateway of the illustrated embodiment includes processing circuitry operating system s and storage components of which may be comprised of hardware software or combinations thereof services support and decoding encoding transcoding functionality to support network interactions such as those described above. Services support in this embodiment includes various functions such as power management bridging and media server receiver services . Other traditional features of a STB gateway may also be included. For example the processing circuitry may include a system on a chip or like device s that provide a core processor audio video decoder media processor DSP graphics core encryption decryption core adaptive transcoding etc.
