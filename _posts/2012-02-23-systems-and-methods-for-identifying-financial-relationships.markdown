This disclosure generally relates to financial data processing and in particular it relates to identifying and analyzing financial relationships.

Financial relationships amongst people arise for a variety of reasons. Married couples tend to have a financial relationship which may include joint and several liability with respect to debt obligations e.g. mortgage loans automobile loans and transaction accounts . Parents may co sign or guarantee debt obligations of their children especially when the children are young adults. Siblings may also have mutual debt obligations such as a mortgage loan on an investment property. Financial relationships tend to be strongest when the borrowers reside in the same physical location though strong financial relationships exist amongst people who do not reside in the same physical location. In these situations and others credit issuers may desire a more detailed analysis of a consumer s financial relationships. However credit bureaus are not able to accomplish this as the co signer s of a tradeline is are not necessarily retained in credit bureau records. Thus there is a need for systems and methods to identify and analyze financial relationships such as those financial relationships that include a shared tradeline.

Internal data includes any data a credit issuer possesses or acquires pertaining to a particular consumer. Internal data may be gathered before during or after a relationship between the credit issuer and the consumer. Such data may include consumer demographic data. Consumer demographic data includes any data pertaining to a consumer. Consumer demographic data may include consumer name address telephone number email address employer and social security number. Consumer transactional data is any data pertaining to the particular transactions in which a consumer engages during any given time period. Consumer transactional data may include transaction amount transaction time transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location. Transaction vendor merchant location may contain a high degree of specificity to a vendor merchant. For example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular gasoline filing station in a particular postal code located at a particular cross section or address. Also for example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular web address such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL an email address and or an Internet Protocol IP address for a vendor merchant. Transaction vendor merchant location may also include information gathered from a WHOIS database pertaining to the registration of a particular web or IP address. WHOIS databases include databases that contain data pertaining to Internet IP address registrations. Transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location may be associated with a particular consumer and further associated with sets of consumers. Consumer payment data includes any data pertaining to a consumer s history of paying debt obligations. Consumer payment data may include consumer payment dates payment amounts balance amount and credit limit. Internal data may further comprise records of consumer service calls complaints requests for credit line increases questions and comments. A record of a consumer service call includes for example date of call reason for call and any transcript or summary of the actual call.

Internal data may further comprise closed loop data and open loop data. Closed loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s closed loop transaction system. A closed loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of one party. Closed loop transaction systems may be used to obtain consumer transactional data. Open loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s open loop transaction system. An open loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of multiple parties.

Credit bureau data includes any data received and or retained by a credit bureau pertaining to a particular consumer. A credit bureau includes any organization that collects and or distributes consumer data. A credit bureau may be a consumer reporting agency. Credit bureaus generally collect financial information pertaining to consumers. Credit bureau data may include for example consumer account data credit limits balances and payment history. Credit bureau data may include credit bureau scores that reflect a consumer s creditworthiness. Credit bureau scores are developed from data available in a consumer s file such as for example the amount of lines of credit payment performance balance and number of tradelines. Consumer data is used to model the risk of a consumer over a period of time using statistical regression analysis. In one embodiment those data elements that are found to be indicative of risk are weighted and combined to determine the credit score. For example each data element may be given a score with the final credit score being the sum of the data element scores.

As used herein a debtor may mean a consumer or business that either owes or may owe money to another party such as a credit issuer. Thus a debtor includes consumers who have not yet borrow money but may apply or have applied to receive a loan.

Credit bureaus may receive credit bureau reporting data from a reporting entity e.g. a credit issuer using a standardized format such as an XML scheme or other structured data container. For example the METRO 2 container is standardized format. The METRO 2 container may one or more of a Header Record a Base Segment a J1 Segment a J2 Segment a K1 Segment and a Trailer Record. The METRO 2 container may be a fixed width file meaning for example each data field may be designated a fixed width that it may not exceed. The METRO 2 container may comprise a delimited file where each data field is delimited by a delimiter such a comma semicolon or pipe 1 character. The METRO 2 container may be formatted in accordance with an XML schema. Credit bureau reporting data may be reported periodically by a credit issuer to report on the status of a particular tradetine.

A debt obligation includes any obligation a consumer has to pay a lender. Any extension of credit from a lender to a consumer is also considered a debt obligation. A debt obligation may be secured or unsecured. Secured obligations may be secured with either real or personal property. A loan or a credit account are types of debt obligations and a security backed by debt obligations is considered a debt obligation itself. A mortgage includes a loan typically in the form of a promissory note secured by real property. The real property may be secured by any legal means such as for example via a mortgage or deed of trust. For convenience a mortgage is used herein to refer to a loan secured by real property. An automobile loan includes a loan typically in the form of a promissory note which is secured by an automobile. For convenience an automobile loan is used herein to refer to a loan secured by an automobile.

A trade or tradeline includes a credit or charge vehicle typically issued to an individual consumer by a credit issuer. Types of tradelines include for example installment accounts such as bank loans student loans home equity loans automobile loans leases and mortgages and revolving accounts such as credit card accounts e.g. a transaction account charge card accounts e.g. a transaction account retail cards and personal lines of credit.

Tradeline data includes the consumer s account status and activity such as for example names of companies where the consumer has accounts dates such accounts were opened credit limits types of accounts balances over a period of time and summary payment histories. Tradeline data is generally available for the vast majority of actual consumers. Tradeline data however typically does not include individual transaction data which is largely unavailable because of consumer privacy protections. Tradeline data may be used to determine both individual and aggregated consumer spending patterns as described herein. Tradeline data may further include negative credit information such as late payment histories write offs settlements judgments and other indicia that the balance associated with the tradeline was not paid in accordance with an underlying loan agreement.

Any transaction account or credit account discussed herein may include an account or an account number. An account or account number as used herein may include any device code number letter symbol digital certificate smart chip digital signal analog signal biometric or other identifier indicia suitably configured to allow the consumer to access interact with or communicate with the system e.g. one or more of an authorization access code personal identification number PIN Internet code other identification code and or the like . The account number may optionally be located on or associated with a rewards card charge card credit card debit card prepaid card telephone card embossed card smart card magnetic stripe card bar code card transponder radio frequency card or an associated account. The system may include or interface with any of the foregoing cards or devices or a fob having a transponder and RFID reader in RF communication with the fob. Although the system may include a fob embodiment the invention is not to be so limited. Indeed system may include any device having a transponder which is configured to communicate with RFID reader via RF communication.

Examples can include watches Internet enabled kitchen appliances restaurant tables embedded with RF readers wallets or purses with imbedded transponders etc.

A lender or credit issuer includes any person entity software and or hardware that provides lending services. A lender may deal in secured or unsecured debt obligations. A lender may engage in secured debt obligations where either real or personal property acts as collateral. A lender need not originate loans but may hold securities backed by debt obligations. A lender may be only a subunit or subdivision of a larger organization. A mortgage holder includes any person or entity that is entitled to repayment of a mortgage. An automobile loan holder is any person or entity that is entitled to repayment of an automobile loan. As used herein the terms lender and credit issuer may be used interchangeably. Credit issuers may include financial services companies that issue credit to consumers.

Furthermore the terms business or merchant may be used interchangeably with each other and shall mean any person entity distributor system software and or hardware that is a provider broker and or any other entity in the distribution chain of goods or services.

Systems and methods disclosed herein may be useful in conjunction with a determination of a size of wallet and or share of wallet. Systems and methods related to size of wallet and or share of wallet are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 788 147 filed Oct. 29 2004 and entitled Method and apparatus for estimating the spend capacity of consumers and U.S. Pat. No. 7 912 770 filed Jun. 20 2005 and entitled Method and apparatus for consumer interaction based on spend capacity and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 497 563 filed Aug. 2 2006 and entitled Determining commercial share of wallet all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Technology advances have made it possible to store manipulate and model large amounts of time series data with minimal expenditure on equipment. As will now be described a financial institution may leverage these technological advances in conjunction with the types of consumer data presently available in the marketplace to more readily estimate the spend capacity of potential and actual customers. A reliable capability to assess the size of a consumer s wallet is introduced in which aggregate time series and raw tradeline data are used to model consumer behavior and attributes and identify categories of consumers based on aggregate behavior. The use of raw trade line time series data and modeled consumer behavior attributes including but not limited to consumer panel data and internal consumer data allows actual consumer spend behavior to be derived from point in time balance information.

In addition the advent of consumer panel data provided through internet channels provides continuous access to actual consumer spend information for model validation and refinement. Industry data including consumer panel information having consumer statement and individual transaction data may be used as inputs to the model and for subsequent verification and validation of its accuracy. The model is developed and refined using actual consumer information with the goals of improving the customer experience and increasing billings growth by identifying and leveraging increased consumer spend opportunities.

A credit provider or other financial institution may also make use of internal proprietary customer data retrieved from its stored internal financial records. Such internal data provides access to even more actual customer spending information and may be used in the development refinement and validation of aggregated consumer spending models as well as verification of the models applicability to existing individual customers on an ongoing basis.

While there has long been market place interest in understanding spend to align offers with consumers and assign credit line size the holistic approach of using a size of wallet calculation across customers lifecycles that is acquisitions through collections has not previously been provided. The various data sources outlined above provide the opportunity for unique model logic development and deployment and as described in more detail in the following various categories of consumers may be readily identified from aggregate and individual data. In certain embodiments of the processes disclosed herein the models may be used to identify specific types of consumers nominally labeled transactors and revolvers based on aggregate spending behavior and to then identify individual customers and prospects that fall into one of these categories. Consumers falling into these categories may then be offered commensurate purchasing incentives based on the model s estimate of consumer spending ability.

Tradeline level data preferably includes up to 24 months or more of balance history and credit attributes captured at the tradeline level including information about accounts as reported by various credit grantors which in turn may be used to derive a broad view of actual aggregated consumer behavioral spending patterns.

Alternatively or in addition thereto one or more of the components may likewise be operated by a provider of individual and aggregate consumer panel data such as commonly provided by comScore Networks Inc. of Reston Va. comScore . Consumer panel data provides more detailed and specific consumer spending information regarding millions of consumer panel participants who provide actual spend data to collectors of such data in exchange for various inducements. The data collected may include any one or more of credit risk scores online credit card application data online credit card purchase transaction data online credit card statement views credit trade type and credit issuer credit issuer code portfolio level statistics credit bureau reports demographic data account balances credit limits purchases balance transfers cash advances payment amounts finance charges annual percentage interest rates on accounts and fees charged all at an individual level for each of the participating panelists. In various embodiments this type of data is used for model development refinement and verification. This type of data is further advantageous over tradeline level data alone for such purposes since such detailed information is not provided at the tradeline level. While such detailed consumer panel data can be used alone to generate a model it may not be wholly accurate with respect to the remaining marketplace of consumers at large without further refinement. Consumer panel data may also be used to generate aggregate consumer data for model derivation and development.

Additionally another source of inputs to the model may be internal spend and payment history of the institution s own customers. From such internal data detailed information at the level of specificity as the consumer panel data may be obtained and used for model development refinement and validation including the categorization of consumers based on identified transactor and revolver behaviors.

Turning now to there is depicted a flowchart of an exemplary process for modeling aggregate consumer behavior in accordance with the present disclosure. The process commences at step wherein individual and aggregate consumer data including time series tradeline data consumer panel data and internal customer financial data is obtained from any of the data sources described previously as inputs for consumer behavior models. In certain embodiments the individual and aggregate consumer data may be provided in a variety of different data formats or structures and consolidated to a single useful format or structure for processing.

Next at step the individual and aggregate consumer data is analyzed to determine consumer spending behavior patterns. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the models may include formulas that mathematically describe the spending behavior of consumers. The particular formulas derived will therefore highly depend on the values resulting from customer data used for derivation as will be readily appreciated. However by way of example only and based on the data provided consumer behavior may be modeled by first dividing consumers into categories that may be based on account balance levels demographic profiles household income levels or any other desired categories. For each of these categories in turn historical account balance and transaction information for each of the consumers may be tracked over a previous period of time such as one to two years. Algorithms may then be employed to determine formulaic descriptions of the distribution of aggregate consumer information over the course of that period of time for the population of consumers examined using any of a variety of known mathematical techniques. These formulas in turn may be used to derive or generate one or more models step for each of the categories of consumers using any of a variety of available trend analysis algorithms. The models may yield the following types of aggregated consumer information for each category average balances maximum balances standard deviation of balances percentage of balances that change by a threshold amount and the like.

Finally at step the derived models may be validated and periodically refined using internal customer data and consumer panel data from sources such as comScore. In various embodiments the model may be validated and refined over time based on additional aggregated and individual consumer data as it is continuously received by an institution computer over the network . Actual customer transaction level information and detailed consumer information panel data may be calculated and used to compare actual consumer spend amounts for individual consumers defined for each month as the difference between the sum of debits to the account and any balance transfers into the account and the spend levels estimated for such consumers using the process above. If a large error is demonstrated between actual and estimated amounts the models and the formulas used may be manually or automatically refined so that the error is reduced. This allows for a flexible model that has the capability to adapt to actual aggregated spending behavior as it fluctuates over time.

As shown in the diagram of a population of consumers for which individual and or aggregated data has been provided may be divided first into two general categories for analysis for example those that are current on their credit accounts representing 1.72 million consumers in the exemplary data sample size of 1.78 million consumers and those that are delinquent representing 0.06 million of such consumers . In one embodiment delinquent consumers may be discarded from the populations being modeled.

In further embodiments the population of current consumers is then subdivided into a plurality of further categories based on the amount of balance information available and the balance activity of such available data. In the example shown in the diagram the amount of balance information available is represented by string of 0 and characters. Each character represents one month of available data with the rightmost character representing the most current months and the leftmost character representing the earliest month for which data is available. In the example provided in a string of six characters is provided representing the six most recent months of data for each category. The character represents a month in which a credit account balance of the consumer has increased. The 0 character may represent months where the account balance is zero. The character represents months for which balance data is unavailable. Also provided the diagram is number of consumers fallen to each category and the percentage of the consumer population they represent in that sample.

In further embodiments only certain categories of consumers may be selected for modeling behavior. The selection may be based on those categories that demonstrate increased spend on their credit balances over time. However it should be readily appreciated that other categories can be used. shows the example of two categories of selected consumers for modeling in bold. These groups show the availability of at least the three most recent months of balance data and that the balances increased in each of those months.

Turning now to therein is depicted an exemplary diagram showing sub categorization of the two categories of in bold that are selected for modeling. In the embodiment shown the sub categories may include consumers having a most recent credit balance less than 400 consumers having a most recent credit balance between 400 and 1600 consumers having a most recent credit balance between 1600 and 5000 consumers whose most recent credit balance is less than the balance of for example three months ago consumers whose maximum credit balance increase over for example the last twelve months divided by the second highest maximum balance increase over the same period is less than 2 and consumers whose maximum credit balance increase over the last twelve months divided by the second highest maximum balance increase is greater than 2. It should be readily appreciated that other subcategories can be used. Each of these sub categories is defined by their last month balance level. The number of consumers from the sample population in millions and the percentage of the population for each category are also shown in .

There may be a certain balance threshold established wherein if a consumer s account balance is too high their behavior may not be modeled since such consumers are less likely to have sufficient spending ability. Alternatively or in addition thereto consumers having balances above such threshold may be sub categorized yet again rather than completely discarded from the sample. In the example shown in the threshold value may be 5000 and only those having particular historical balance activity may be selected i.e. those consumers whose present balance is less than their balance three months earlier or whose maximum balance increase in the examined period meets certain parameters. Other threshold values may also be used and may be dependent on the individual and aggregated consumer data provided.

As described in the foregoing the models generated in the process may be derived validated and refined using tradeline and consumer panel data. An example of tradeline data from Experian and consumer panel data from comScore are represented in . Each row of the data represents the record of one consumer and thousands of such records may be provided at a time. The statement shows the point in time balance of consumers accounts for three successive months Balance 1 Balance 2 and Balance 3 . The data shows each consumer s purchase volume last payment amount previous balance amount and current balance. Such information may be obtained for example by page scraping the data in any of a variety of known manners using appropriate application programming interfaces from an Internet web site or network address at which the data is displayed. Furthermore the data and may be matched by consumer identity and combined by one of the data providers or another third party independent of the financial institution. Validation of the models using the combined data and may then be performed and such validation may be independent of consumer identity.

Turning now to therein is depicted an exemplary process for estimating the size of an individual consumer s spending wallet. Upon completion of the modeling of the consumer categories above the process commences with the selection of individual consumers or prospects to be examined step . An appropriate model derived during the process will then be applied to the presently available consumer tradeline information in the following manner to determine based on the results of application of the derived models an estimate of a consumer s size of wallet. Each consumer of interest may be selected based on their falling into one of the categories selected for modeling described above or may be selected using any of a variety of criteria.

The process continues to step where for a selected consumer a paydown percentage over a previous period of time is estimated for each of the consumer s credit accounts. In one embodiment the paydown percentage is estimated over the previous three month period of time based on available tradeline data and may be calculated according to the following formula Pay down The sum of the last three months payments from the account The sum of three month balances for the account based on tradeline data . The paydown percentage may be set to for example 2 for any consumer exhibiting less than a 5 paydown percentage and may be set to 100 if greater than 80 as a simplified manner for estimating consumer spending behaviors on either end of the paydown percentage scale.

Consumers that exhibit less than a 50 paydown during this period may be categorized as revolvers while consumers that exhibit a 50 paydown or greater may be categorized as transactors. These categorizations may be used to initially determine what if any purchasing incentives may be available to the consumer as described later below.

The process then continues to step where balance transfers for a previous period of time are identified from the available tradeline data for the consumer. The identification of balance transfers are essential since although tradeline data may reflect a higher balance on a credit account over time such higher balance may simply be the result of a transfer of a balance into the account and are thus not indicative of a true increase in the consumer s spending. It is difficult to confirm balance transfers based on tradeline data since the information available is not provided on a transaction level basis. In addition there are typically lags or absences of reporting of such values on tradeline reports.

Nonetheless marketplace analysis using confirmed consumer panel and internal customer financial records has revealed reliable ways in which balance transfers into an account may be identified from imperfect individual tradeline data alone. Three exemplary reliable methods for identifying balance transfers from credit accounts each which is based in part on actual consumer data sampled are as follows. It should be readily apparent that these formulas in this form are not necessary for all embodiments of the present process and may vary based on the consumer data used to derive them.

A first rule identifies a balance transfer for a given consumer s credit account as follows. The month having the largest balance increase in the tradeline data and which satisfies the following conditions may be identified as a month in which a balance transfer has occurred 

A second rule identifies a balance transfer for a given consumer s credit account in any month where the balance is above twelve times the previous month s balance and the next month s balance differs by no more than 20 .

The process then continues to step where consumer spend on each credit account is estimated over the next for example three month period. In estimating consumer spend any spending for a month in which a balance transfer has been identified from individual tradeline data above is set to zero for purposes of estimating the size of the consumer s spending wallet reflecting the supposition that no real spending has occurred on that account. The estimated spend for each of the three previous months may then be calculated as follows Estimated spend the current balance the previous month s balance the previous month s balance the estimated pay down from step above . The exact form of the formula selected may be based on the category in which the consumer is identified from the model applied and the formula is then computed iteratively for each of the three months of the first period of consumer spend.

Next at step of the process the estimated spend is then extended over for example the previous three quarterly or three month periods providing a most recent year of estimated spend for the consumer.

Finally at step this in turn may be used to generate a plurality of final outputs for each consumer account step . These may be provided in an output file that may include a portion or all of the following exemplary information based on the calculations above and information available from individual tradeline data i size of previous twelve month spending wallet ii size of spending wallet for each of the last four quarters iii total number of revolving cards revolving balance and average pay down percentage for each iv total number of transacting cards and transacting balances for each v the number of balance transfers and total estimated amount thereof vi maximum revolving balance amounts and associated credit limits and vii maximum transacting balance and associated credit limit.

After step the process ends with respect to the examined consumer. It should be readily appreciated that the process may be repeated for any number of current customers or consumer prospects.

Referring now to therein is depicted illustrative diagrams of how such estimated spending is calculated in a rolling manner across each previous three month quarterly period. In there is depicted a first three month period i.e. the most recent previous quarter on a timeline . As well there is depicted a first twelve month period on a timeline representing the last twenty one months of point in time account balance information available from individual tradeline data for the consumer s account. Each month s balance for the account is designated as B . B B represent actual account balance information available over the past twelve months for the consumer. B B represent consumer balances over consecutive preceding months.

In accordance with the diagram spending in each of the three months of the first quarter is calculated based on the balance values B B the category of the consumer based on consumer spending models generated in the process and the formulas used in steps and .

Turning now to there is shown a diagram illustrating the balance information used for estimating spending in a second previous quarter using a second twelve month period of balance information . Spending in each of these three months of the second previous quarter is based on known balance information B B.

Turning now to there is shown a diagram illustrating the balance information used for estimating spending in a third successive quarter using a third twelve month period of balance information . Spending in each of these three months of the third previous quarter is based on known balance information B B.

Turning now to there is shown a diagram illustrating the balance information used for estimating spending in a fourth previous quarter using a fourth twelve month period of balance information . Spending in each of these three months of the fourth previous quarter is based on balance information B B.

It should be readily appreciated that as the rolling calculations proceed the consumer s category may change based on the outputs that result and therefore different formula corresponding to the new category may be applied to the consumer for different periods of time. The rolling manner described above maximizes the known data used for estimating consumer spend in a previous twelve month period .

Based on the final output generated for the customer commensurate purchasing incentives may be identified and provided to the consumer for example in anticipation of an increase in the consumer s purchasing ability as projected by the output file. In such cases consumers of good standing who are categorized as transactors with a projected increase in purchasing ability may be offered a lower financing rate on purchases made during the period of expected increase in their purchasing ability or may be offered a discount or rebate for transactions with selected merchants during that time.

In another example and in the case where a consumer is a revolver such consumer with a projected increase in purchasing ability may be offered a lower annual percentage rate on balances maintained on their credit account.

Other like promotions and enhancements to consumers experiences are well known and may be used within the processes disclosed herein.

Various statistics for the accuracy of the processes and are provided in for which a consumer sample was analyzed by the process and validated using 24 months of historic actual spend data. The table of shows the number of consumers having a balance of 5000 or more for whom the estimated paydown percentage calculated in step above matched the actual paydown percentage as determined from internal transaction data and external consumer panel data .

The table of shows the number of consumers having a balance of 5000 or more who were expected to be transactors or revolvers and who actually turned out to be transactors and revolvers based on actual spend data. As can be seen the number of expected revolvers who turned out to be actual revolvers 80539 was many times greater than the number of expected revolvers who turned out to be transactors 1090 . Likewise the number of expected and actual transactors outnumbered by nearly four to one the number of expected transactors that turned out to be revolvers.

The table of shows the number of estimated versus actual instances in the consumer sample of when there occurred a balance transfer into an account. For instance in the period sampled there were 148 326 instances where no balance transfers were identified in step above and for which a comparison of actual consumer data showed there were in fact no balance transfers in. This compares to only 9 534 instances where no balance transfers were identified in step but there were in fact actual balance transfers.

The table of shows the accuracy of estimated spending in steps versus actual spending for consumers with account balances at the time this sample testing was performed greater than 5000. As can be seen the estimated spending at each spending level most closely matched the same actual spending level than for any other spending level in nearly all instances.

The table of shows the accuracy of estimated spending in steps versus actual spending for consumers having most recent account balances between 1600 and 5000. As can be readily seen the estimated spending at each spending level most closely matched the same actual spending level than for any other spending level in all instances.

The table of shows the accuracy of estimated spending versus actual spending for all consumers in the sample. As can be readily seen the estimated spending at each spending level most closely matched the same actual spending level than for any other actual spending level in all instances.

The table of shows the rank order of estimated versus actual spending for all consumers in the sample. This table readily shows that the number of consumers expected to be in the bottom 10 of spending most closely matched the actual number of consumers in that category by 827 716 to 22 721. The table further shows that the number of consumers expected to be in the top 10 of spenders most closely matched the number of consumers who were actually in the top 10 by 71 773 to 22 721.

The table of shows estimated versus actual annual spending for all consumers in the sample over the most recent year of available data. As can be readily seen the expected number of consumers at each spending level most closely matched the same actual spending level than any other level in all instances.

Finally the table of shows the rank order of estimated versus actual total annual spending for all the consumers over the most recent year of available data. Again the number of expected consumers in each rank most closely matched the actual rank than any other rank.

Prospective customer populations used for modeling and or later evaluation may be provided from any of a plurality of available marketing groups or may be culled from credit bureau data targeted advertising campaigns or the like. Testing and analysis may be continuously performed to identify the optimal placement and required frequency of such sources for using the size of spending wallet calculations. The processes described herein may also be used to develop models for predicting a size of wallet for an individual consumer.

Institutions adopting the processes disclosed herein may expect to more readily and profitably identify opportunities for prospect and customer offerings which in turn provides enhanced experiences across all parts of a customer s lifecycle. In the case of a credit provider accurate identification of spend opportunities allows for rapid provisioning of card member offerings to increase spend that in turn results in increased transaction fees interest charges and the like. The careful selection of customers to receive such offerings reduces the incidence of fraud that may occur in less disciplined card member incentive programs. This in turn reduces overall operating expenses for institutions.

In addition to determining the size of wallet of a single consumer the above process may also be used in determining the size of wallet of a given household. Determining the size of wallet of a household allows a financial institution to more accurately estimate the spend opportunity associated with an individual than would be estimated from the individual s size of wallet alone. For example two example consumers may have the same individual size of wallet. However one consumer is single and lives alone but the other consumer is married to a spouse whose size of wallet is twice as big as the second consumer. The second consumer thus has more spending potential than the first even though they look very similar when standing alone.

In step once individual consumers are grouped into a household tradelines held by one or more of the consumers in the household are identified and associated with the household. The tradelines may be determined using for example and without limitation credit bureau data and internal records of the financial institution.

In step duplicate tradelines are identified and removed from association with the household such that only unique trades remain associated with the household. Duplicates occur when the basic user of an account shares a household with a supplemental user of the same account. To identify duplicate tradelines the history is obtained for every tradeline associated with the household. The history may be limited to a given timeframe such as the previous 24 months. This history may include for example and without limitation account balance and transaction information. The histories of the tradelines are then compared to determine if any tradeline in the household has the same historical performance as another tradeline in the household. If two tradelines are identified as having the same historical performance one of the tradelines is determined to be a duplicate and is not considered in the household size of wallet calculation.

In step an estimated spend capacity for each of the remaining unique tradelines is calculated based on the balance of the tradeline. The estimated spend capacity may be calculated for example as described with respect to method above.

In step the estimated spend capacities of the unique tradelines in the household are summed. The resulting combined spend capacity is output as the household size of wallet. The household size of wallet can then be associated with each individual consumer in the household.

Once individual consumers are tagged with or otherwise identified by their household size of wallet a financial institution can more accurately categorize the consumers and provide the consumers with more relevant offers. For example based on the household size of wallet calculated for an existing customer purchasing incentives may be identified and provided to the existing customer to encourage spend on an existing account. In another example prospective customers may be targeted based on their own specific household sizes of wallet and or spend characteristics of other consumers in their household. In this example a prospective cardholder whose household size of wallet is significantly higher than his individual size of wallet is expected to have high spend and a high response rate to product offers. Similarly a prospective cardholder that lives in the same household as a high spend low risk card holder is expected to be high spend and low risk as well. Such targeting encourages spend by prospective cardholders on new accounts.

Categorizing consumers by household type reveals trends which can be used to identify low risk prospects without completing size of wallet analyses for each specific prospect. The household size and mix of consumers therein defines a household type. is a chart identifying various household types . Each household type has a particular size and a particular mix . Size corresponds to the number of consumers in the household. Mix corresponds to the number of basic cardholders supplemental cardholders and prospective cardholders in the household. Each household type makes up a percentage of all households.

By identifying the types of households having the largest wallets a financial institution can target consumers in those household types with new product offers and or incentives on existing products to encourage spend with the financial institution by the consumers. For example the financial institution can target prospective cardholders of all type A households with an offer for a new card product that suits their needs since those cardholders are the most likely to accept such an offer while maintaining a low risk of default.

Once the size of wallet has been determined for a given household the share of the household wallet held by a particular financial institution can also be determined. The share of wallet is the percentage of the total size of wallet that is associated with the financial institution and can typically be determined for example from the internal records of the financial institution. By identifying households where the financial institution has only a small share of the household size of wallet the financial institution can determine which households offer the best prospects for spending growth. This is referred to as the spend opportunity. Households having a large spend opportunity can then be targeted for product offers and incentives to increase spend by the consumer with the financial institution. For example for a financial institution having the exemplary share of household wallet distribution illustrated in the greatest spend opportunity is available in households having one basic cardholder and one supplemental cardholder type B and households having one basic cardholder and one prospective cardholder type C .

As described above the identification of financial relationships may be difficult because credit bureaus at present do not associate tradelines with debtors other than the primary debtor that is identifiable. In addition grouping consumers solely by physical residential address is a less preferred method of determining a household as it has the disadvantages described above. Moreover consumers have financial relationships that transcend physical residential address. For example a parent may co sign for a credit card with a child who is a young adult e.g. a child in college . A child may co sign an automobile loan for a parent who would not be able to secure such a loan without a co signor. Unmarried couples may share financial obligations despite maintaining separate residences. Identifying types of financial relationships that extend beyond a shared physical residential address may be used in improving marketing credit approval decisions and other financial calculations a described herein. Thus improved methods for identifying and analyzing financial relationships are desirable.

Credit bureaus typically receive credit bureau reporting data e.g. as reported using METRO 2 and populate debtor records associated with the tradeline. For example a credit bureau reporting data in a METRO 2 container may be received by a credit bureau. The credit bureau may parse the Base Segment to identify the primary debtor and may further parse the J1 or J2 segments to identify a secondary debtor. The credit bureau may further parse the Base Segment to identify a secondary debtor. The credit bureau may then update its records for the primary debtor and update its records pertaining to the secondary debtor but conventionally no linkage between the debtors is made. The credit bureau reporting data e.g. the METRO 2 container is conventionally purged after the debtor records are updated. Thus one cannot query for all debtors associated with that tradeline by using the tradeline data. Stated another way one may not identity all debtors associated with a given tradeline. One could not identify financial relationships then from present credit bureau records.

In various embodiments a credit bureau may receive credit bureau reporting data and create a linkage also referred to as a link between the tradeline and the debtors associated with the tradeline. Such a linkage may take the form of a combination e.g. concatenation of two or more fields from a tradeline. Stated another way the linkage may be a numeric or alphanumeric representation of the tradeline that is unique or likely unique to that tradeline. In this manner the linkage may be produced from data related to the tradeline that are static over time such as trade open date but the linkage may also be produced from data related to the tradeline that is dynamic over time such as the high credit field . In various embodiments a linkage may comprise a combination or concatenation of subscriber code and account number. For example a tradeline with subscriber code 1234 and account number 567 may be concatenated to produce the linkage 1234567. In that regard it is likely that across a tradeline very few if any will have the same linkage value. Other fields that may be used in the linkage may be the last update date trade open date and balance. In various embodiments to increase the likelihood that the linkage will be unique for each tradeline and or to assist in obscuring the underlying data a hash function cryptographic function or other similar function may be used to transform the linkage into another form. Thus in various embodiments a cryptographic function is used to hide the subscriber code and account number in a linkage such that one could not without possession of the cryptographic function obtain the unencrypted linkage.

Accordingly the link could be used to query for tradelines associated with two or more debtors. For example a reference or pointer may be associated with the tradeline that references the primary and secondary debtor. In that regard a data store may be queried to identify a tradeline and then associate primary and secondary debtors. Accordingly given a tradeline one may find the associated debtors.

By retaining a linkage between a primary and a secondary debtor and a tradeline obtained from credit reporting data it is understood that such linkage is of high accuracy. Stated another way one may be nearly certain that the tradeline is in fact associated with the primary debtor and the secondary debtor as the only source of inaccuracy may be from the entity that is providing the credit reporting data. Thus the linkage contained in the credit reporting data may be considered definitive.

With reference to method is illustrated. Credit reporting data may be received in step . Credit reporting data may be in a METRO 2 container. The credit reporting data may be parsed in step . Parsing may occur using any suitable method or parser. In embodiments where a METRO 2 container is used the parsing may be of the Base Segment the J1 Segment the J2 Segment or combinations thereof. The Base Segment the J1 Segment or the J2 Segment may contain data relating to a secondary debtor associated with the tradeline reported in the METRO 2 container such as co debtor name address and age along with data relating to one or more additional debtors. The Base Segment may contain a generation code GEN code that contains information on the number of co debtors on a tradeline. The J1 and or J2 segments may contain similar information. It should be understood that the METRO 2 container may have an analog provided in an XML format and thus the disclosure herein is not limited to a METRO 2 container that comprises a delimited or fixed width file. A link may be created in step that links the tradeline with one or more co debtors derived from parsing step . For example step may comprise obtaining the subscriber code and the account number from the METRO 2 container. Step may further comprise combining e.g. concatenating the subscriber code and the account number to create a linkage. Optionally in step the linkage may be encrypted or otherwise transformed to a different data value.

With reference to method is illustrated. A METRO 2 container may be received in step . Parsing of the METRO 2 container including parsing the J1 Segment the J2 Segment and or the Base Segment is performed in step . A link may be created in step that links the tradeline described in the METRO 2 container with one or more co debtors derived from parsing step .

In various embodiments however credit bureau data may exist in a data store that does not contain such link. For example this may occur where the credit bureau did not retain the linkage between a tradeline and a primary and secondary debtor. Thus other methods may be employed to identify financial relationships with a higher degree of accuracy.

In various embodiments a tradeline may be used to produce a fingerprint and the fingerprint may be used to query for associated debtors. A tradeline contains tradeline data such as original balance amount current balance payment history origination date credit issuer name and other like data. Two or more data fields from the tradeline data may be selected for the creation of a fingerprint. A fingerprint such as a digital fingerprint is a mathematical representation of the input data. A fingerprint algorithm similar to a hash function for example may be used to insure that different input data produces a different fingerprint. Thus a fingerprint algorithm may be used to make sure that no two fingerprints are the same unless the input data is the same. Fingerprint algorithms may be used and or hash functions checksum functions and randomization functions among others.

For example debtor A may have a tradeline with credit issuer Bank X originated on Jul. 29 2006 having an opening balance of thirty thousand dollars and a current balance of ten thousand dollars. A fingerprint algorithm may be used to produce a digital output i.e. a number that represents a fingerprint of these inputs. The tradelines of other debtors may then be queried. It may then be found that debtor B and debtor C have tradelines with the same fingerprint. Thus it is likely that debtor B and debtor C are associated with the tradeline and the records associated with debtor B and debtor C may be updated to reflect the association. In various embodiments multiple fingerprints may be made using varying input data fields. In the above example an alternate fingerprint may be created using credit issuer Bank X originated on Jul. 29 2006 having an opening balance of thirty thousand dollars a current balance of ten thousand dollars and the presence of a missed or late payment in March 2009. Querying the alternate fingerprint may return only debtor B thus indicating that debtor C may have a similar but not identical tradeline as debtors A and B. The use of one or more alternate fingerprints may improve accuracy.

For example with reference to method is illustrated. A tradeline may be identified in step . A fingerprint may be generated for the tradeline in step . The fingerprint may be generated by selecting one or more data points from the tradeline and processing the data points through a fingerprint algorithm to produce a digital fingerprint. Step may be generated for many tradelines in a data store for a number of debtors. The digital fingerprint may then be used to retrieve other debtors who may have tradelines with identical fingerprints in step .

Use of a fingerprint may be highly accurate though not as accurate as definitive knowledge of a link such as would be obtained in credit reporting data. Thus use of a fingerprint may be performed on a data store containing credit bureau data to identify common tradelines and link co debtors together. Then upon receipt of credit reporting data on the tradeline the credit reporting data may be parsed to reveal one or more associated debtors. The credit reporting data may be compared to the linkages created through the use of a fingerprint. Linkages may be modified i.e. deleted or edited in response to the credit reporting data. This improves accuracy as well as provides an accuracy metric relative to the type of fingerprint methodology used. For example the accuracy metric may comprise the percentage of linkages found in credit reporting data from the total number of linkages identified by use of a fingerprint.

Linkages between debtors may reveal a debtor entity. A debtor entity may be defined as one or more persons that are liable on a tradeline i.e. co signer etc . For example a married couple comprising debtor A and debtor B form a debtor entity. The debtor entity may then be queried against for example a data store comprising credit bureau data to return all tradelines associated with the debtor entity. The returned data may be referred to as household tradeline data. In various embodiments expanded household tradeline data includes tradelines associated with debtor A and debtor B but also tradelines associated with debtor A only and debtor B only. The expanded household tradeline data thus provides a more comprehensive picture of the union of debtor A and debtor B whereas household tradeline data provides an insight into how debtor A and debtor B behave as a debtor entity. In various embodiments household tradeline data and expanded household tradeline data may comprise data from debtors that do not reside at the same physical address. Thus the term household in this term is used for convenience only.

To demonstrate household tradeline data and expanded household tradeline data and with reference to Venn diagram is shown. Area includes all tradelines of a first debtor. Area includes all tradelines of a second debtor. Area shows the intersection of area and area representing the household tradeline data or the tradelines that are associated with both the first debtor and second debtor. The union of area and which includes area may comprise expanded household tradeline data.

Thus it may be found that household tradeline data provides a picture of stable debtors with little to no negative payment histories but expanded household tradeline data may show that one or more of the underlying debtors has separate tradelines that have a negative history. This may be the case for a couple where one or more spouses has previously divorced. The divorced spouse may have negative credit history on separate accounts but positive credit history on accounts where joined by the present spouse.

In various embodiments debtors that are associated with a tradeline may have different physical residential addresses. The demographic data from the different residential addresses may be obtained to improve various activities such as marketing and collection efforts. Demographic data may include ZIP 4 of residential address census data e.g. number of people income levels etc and data relating to the number and types of businesses in the ZIP 4 or other geographic descriptor e.g. number of big box discount stores number of liquor stores pawn shops adult entertainment venues non bank check cashing stores car title loan stores non bank unsecured loan stores number of public housing projects number of luxury goods retailers etc . Demographic data may be used as described below.

To further collect data relating to financial relationships contact information may be collected from various debtors such as through a social networking site a cloud service e.g. ICLOUD or through a mobile smartphone application an app . The collection of contact information may be merged with debtor records to provide further information regarding a debtor s co debtors and the familial or marital relationship. For example it a debtor stores a contact labeled wife and the debtor is also linked to a mortgage tradeline associated with the person labeled wife it may be inferred that the co debtor is the debtor s wife. In various embodiments a debtor s contact list may contain contacts that do not have existing tradelines such as for example minor children. Such contacts may be referred to as unmatched debtor records. The relationship to the debtor may preserved in a record for the unmatched debtor. At a later time when the unmatched debtor opens a tradeline e.g. a minor child reaches adulthood and open a transaction account the unmatched debtor may be linked to the debtor.

Outputs of the disclosed financial relationship identification the FRI model can be used in various analytics and may provide improved marketing and collection activities among other activities.

A method of marketing is illustrated in . A second debtor on a tradeline associated with a first debtor may be identified using one or more of the methods disclosed above in step . The second debtor may then be the subject of marketing in step . The products or services marketed may be similar to the tradeline associated with a first debtor. In various embodiments however internal data is obtained relating to the first debtor and or the second debtor. The internal data may be analyzed to determine the spending behaviors of the first debtor and or the second debtor. Thus the spending behavior of the first debtor may be used to tailor the marketing to the second debtor. The marketing of step may be distributed to the first debtor yet targeted to the second debtor. For example if internal data is used to show that the second debtor shops at a particular store every week marketing material promoting the store or the store s competitor may be sent to the first debtor with the intention that the first debtor will be aware of the second debtor s affinity for the store or the second debtor s desire to try a new competing store and share it with the second debtor. In this manner the social networking power may amplify the marketing message. Stated another way marketing is more likely to result in a sale when it originates from a person the marketing target knows. In this case co debtors often have a close relationship such as married couples parents and children and other forms of relationships. The marketing may comprise an offer to add the second debtor to a tradeline of the first debtor. For example where a first debtor and a second debtor are linked to a mortgage tradeline it may be found that first debtor has a tradeline for a transaction account from credit issuer A and second debtor has a tradeline for a transaction account from credit issuer B. Credit issuer A may be then provide an incentive for the first debtor to add the second debtor to the first debtor s transaction account. This may be especially useful if the second debtor s size of wallet is large relative to the first debtor and or if the credit issuer has a small share of wallet relative to the second debtor.

A method of using internal data is shown in . As discussed above one may identify a household tradeline data set or an expanded household tradeline data set in step . One may then obtain internal data relating to the debtors in the household data set. Spending patterns may be determined in step using the internal data. In this regard a spending profile may be built. The spending profile may be used to tailor marketing to the underlying debtors on a household tradeline data set or an expanded household tradeline data set. For example a daily deal type campaign may be submitted to the debtors who are linked by a tradeline for a daily deal in the area of a shared residence. The daily deal may be a business or a type of business frequented by one or more of the debtors. For example a pizza shop or a coffee shop that competes with a similar business frequented by one or more the debtors may want to promote itself by offering such a daily deal in a targeted manner.

Use of internal data may be especially useful with financial relationships that extend between two people that do not reside at the same physical address. For example it may be found that a parent shares a transaction account with a child who attends college in a different state or region from the parent. Thus marketing to the child will be age appropriate e.g. youth oriented brands bars nightclubs and youth oriented entertainment and in accordance with the spending patterns of both the child and parent. Thus a child with a parent who has a large size of wallet may be marketed with more upscale goods and services. A child with a parent who dines out often may thus be accustomed to dining out and may thus be the subject of restaurant marketing. On the other hand a child who has a parent that purchases more groceries and dines out less may be accustomed to such a lifestyle and may be the subject of marketing for grocery stores that match the parent s grocery shopping habits i.e. children of parents who shop at WHOLE FOODS will receive marketing for TRADER JOE S or SPROUTS or WHOLE FOODS . Complimentary goods and services may also be marketed to the child. In addition a child s transaction account may be linked to a parent. The child s spending patterns may the be used to market goods and services to the parent in addition to use of the parent s demographic information and internal data associated with the parent.

Where two debtors are associated with the same tradeline and do not reside in the same physical address demographic data for each debtor may be used in marketing collection efforts and other efforts. For example when a primary debtor lives in a different type of area than the secondary debtor e.g. the secondary debtor live in a ZIP 4 with a high number of businesses associated with risky behaviors the primary debtor may be deemed to be less creditworthy. On the other hand the secondary debtor may be deemed to be more creditworthy as the secondary debtor has a relationship with a more financially stable person. In addition local businesses may be market to the secondary debtor because of the financial relationship with the first debtor.

A size of wallet calculation as described herein may be performed on debtors who share one or more tradelines. In this manner a size of wallet of a debtor entity may be determined. Marketing activities may be performed in response to this calculation. In addition collection efforts may be tailored in response to this calculation. For example if a first debtor is not current on a tradeline but it is found that the first debtor is linked to a second debtor that has a high size of wallet or otherwise has a good credit history aggressive collection efforts may be warranted against the first debtor. In this manner it may be expected that the first debtor will seek to further the financial relationship with the second debtor by asking the second debtor for help with respect to the tradeline in collections. In addition the first debtor may use a credit line already shared with the second debtor to settle the tradeline in collections. For example the first debtor may use a home equity line of credit secured by the home of the second debtor to settle the tradeline in collections. However if the second debtor has a low size of wallet or has negative credit history aggressive collection efforts may not result in a recovery of substantial funds.

A credit score may be derived for a debtor entity based upon either a household tradeline data set or an expanded household tradeline data set. The credit score may be formulated to be forward looking in that it is useful in predicting default on future debt obligations or it may be backward looking in that it is useful in predicting default on existing debt obligations. Predicting default on future debt obligations may be useful in making credit approval decisions. Predicting default on existing debt obligations may be useful in the buying or selling of debt obligations and or securities derived from the same.

The credit score may be derived using any suitable methodology. The credit score may be based on either the household tradeline data set or an expanded household tradeline data set. In this regard as described above it may be found that certain underlying debtors do not meet debt obligations they have alone but do meet debt obligations they share with others. Thus a debtor entity may be relatively creditworthy while one or more of the constituent debtors of the debtor entity may not be creditworthy.

A credit score that is predictive of default on existing debt obligations may be useful in the buying and selling of debt obligations. For example an installment loan such as automobile loans may be bundled as an asset back security as mortgage loans may be as well. A purchaser of an asset back security interest may want to assess the stability of the underlying debt obligations. The use of a credit score may assist in that regard and the added insight relating to shared or linked debt obligations may improve the accuracy of the credit score.

Credit approval decisions may be based at least in part on a credit score as discussed above or by household tradeline data set or an expanded household tradeline data set. Credit approval decisions may be for a new transaction account a credit limit increase on an exiting transaction account a mortgage loan an automobile loan a home equity loan or a student loan.

Outputs of the FRI model can be used in any business or market segment that extends credit or otherwise evaluates the creditworthiness of a particular consumer. In various embodiments these businesses will be referred to herein as falling into one of three categories financial services companies retail companies and other companies.

The business cycle in each category may be divided into three phases acquisition retention and disposal. The acquisition phase occurs when a business is attempting to gain new consumers. The acquisition phase includes for example targeted marketing determining what products or services to offer a consumer deciding whether to lend to a particular consumer and what the line size or loan should be and deciding whether to buy a particular loan. The retention phase occurs after a consumer is already associated with the business. In the retention phase the business interests shift to managing the consumer relationship through for example consideration of risk determination of credit lines cross sell opportunities increasing business from that consumer and increasing the company s assets under management.

The disposal phase is entered when a business wishes to dissociate itself from a consumer or otherwise end the consumer relationship. The disposal phase can occur for example through settlement offers collections and sale of defaulted or near default loans.

Financial services companies include for example banks and other lenders mutual fund companies financiers of leases and sales life insurance companies online brokerages credit issuers and loan buyers.

Banks and lenders can utilize the FRT model in all phases of the business cycle. One exemplary use is in relation to home equity loans and the rating given to a particular bond issue in the capital market. The FRI model would apply to home equity lines of credit and automobile loans in a similar manner.

For example if the holder of a home equity loan borrows from the capital market the loan holder issues asset backed securities ABS or bonds which are backed by receivables. The loan holder is thus an ABS issuer. The ABS issuer applies for an ABS rating which is assigned based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables. One of skill in the art will recognize that the ABS issuer may apply for the ABS rating through any application means without altering the spirit and scope of the present invention. In assigning a rating the rating agencies weigh a loan s probability of default by considering the lender s underwriting and portfolio management processes. Lenders generally secure higher ratings by credit enhancement. Examples of credit enhancement include over collateralization buying insurance such as wrap insurance and structuring ABS through for example senior subordinate bond structures sequential pay vs. pari passu etc. to achieve higher ratings. Lenders and rating agencies take the probability of default into consideration when determining the appropriate level of credit enhancement.

During the acquisition phase of a loan lenders may use the FRI model to improve their lending decisions. Before issuing the loan lenders can evaluate a consumer s risk of default using the consumer s associations with various other lenders. Evaluation leads to fewer bad loans and a reduced probability of default for loans in the lender s portfolio. A lower probability of default means that for a given loan portfolio that has been originated using the FRI model either a higher rating can be obtained with the same degree of over collateralization or the degree of over collateralization can be reduced for a given debt rating. Thus using the FRI model at the acquisition stage of the loan reduces the lender s overall borrowing cost and loan loss reserves.

During the retention phase of a loan the FRI model can be used to track a consumer s varying degree of risk. Based on the FRI outputs the lender can make various decisions regarding the consumer relationship. For example a lender may use the FRI model to identify borrowers who become more likely to default via the borrowers association with other lenders. The credit lines of those borrowers which have not fully been drawn down can then be reduced. Selectively revoking unused lines of credit may reduce the probability of default for loans in a given portfolio and reduce the lender s borrowing costs. Selectively revoking unused lines of credit may also reduce the lender s risk by minimizing further exposure to a borrower that may already be in financial distress.

During the disposal phase of a loan the FRI model enables lenders to better predict the likelihood that a borrower will default. Once the lender has identified consumers who are in danger of default the lender may select those likely to repay and extend settlement offers. Additionally lenders can use the FRI model to identify which consumers are unlikely to pay and those who are otherwise not worth extending a settlement offer.

The FRI model allows lenders to identify loans with risk of default allowing lenders prior to default to begin anticipating a course of action to take if default occurs. Because freshly defaulted loans fetch a higher sale price than loans that have been non performing for longer time periods lenders may sell these loans earlier in the default period thereby reducing the lender s costs.

Financiers of leases or sales such as automobile lease or sale financiers can benefit from FRI outputs in much the same way as a bank or lender as discussed above. In typical product financing however the amount of the loan or lease is based on the value of the product being financed. Therefore there is generally no credit limit that needs to be revisited during the course of the loan. As there is no credit limit to be revisited the FRI model is most useful to lease sales finance companies during the acquisition and disposal phases of the business cycle.

Just as the FRI model can help loan holders determine that a particular loan is nearing default loan buyers can use the model to evaluate the quality of a prospective purchase during the acquisition phase of the business cycle. Evaluation assists the loan buyers in avoiding or reducing the sale prices of loans that are in likelihood of default based on the consumer s association with other lenders.

Aspects of the retail industry for which the FRI model would be advantageous include for example retail stores having private label cards on line retailers and mail order companies.

There are two general types of credit and charge cards in the marketplace today multipurpose cards and private label cards. A third type of hybrid card is emerging. Multipurpose cards are cards that can be used at multiple different merchants and service providers. For example American Express Visa Mastercard and Discover are considered multipurpose card issuers. Multipurpose cards are accepted by merchants and other service providers in what is often referred to as an open network. Transactions are routed from a point of sale POS through a network for authorization transaction posting and settlement.

A variety of intermediaries play different roles in the process. These include merchant processors the brand networks and issuer processors. An open network is often referred to as an interchange network. Multipurpose cards include a range of different card types such as charge cards revolving cards and debit cards which are linked to a consumer s demand deposit account DDA or checking account.

Private label cards are cards that can be used for the purchase of goods and services from a single merchant or service provider. Historically major department stores were the originators of private label cards. Private label cards are now offered by a wide range of retailers and other service providers. These cards are generally processed on a closed network with transactions flowing between the merchant s POS and its own backoffice or the processing center for a third party processor. These transactions do not flow through an interchange network and are not subject to interchange fees.

Recently a type of hybrid card has evolved. A hybrid card when used at a particular merchant is that merchant s private label card but when used elsewhere becomes a multipurpose card. The particular merchant s transactions are processed in the proprietary private label network. Transactions made with the card at all other merchants and service providers are processed through an interchange network.

Private label card issuers in addition to multipurpose card issuers and hybrid card issuers can apply the FRI model in a similar way as described above with respect to credit card companies. Knowledge of a consumer s association with other lenders coupled with FRI outputs could be used by card issuers to improve performance and profitability across the entire business cycle.

Online retail and mail order companies can use the FRI model in both the acquisition and retention phases of the business cycle. During the acquisition phase for example the companies can base targeted marketing strategies on FRI outputs.

Targeted marketing could substantially reduce costs especially in the mail order industry where catalogs are typically sent to a wide variety of individuals. During the retention phase companies can for example base cross sell strategies or credit line extensions on FRI outputs.

Types of companies which also may make use of the FRI model include for example and without limitation the gaming industry communications providers and the travel industry.

The gaming industry can use the FRI model in for example the acquisition and retention phases of the business cycle. Casinos often extend credit to their wealthiest and or most active players also known as high rollers. The casinos can use the FRI model in the acquisition phase to determine whether credit should be extended to an individual. Once credit has been extended the casinos can use the FRI model to periodically review the consumer s risk of default.

Communications providers such as telephone service providers often contract into service plans with their consumers. In addition to improving their targeted marketing strategies communications providers can use the FRI outputs during the acquisition phase to determine the risk of default on a service contract associated with a potential consumer.

Members of the travel industry can make use of the FRI outputs in the acquisition and retention stages of the business cycle. For example a hotelier typically has a brand of hotel that is associated with a particular star level or class of hotel. In order to capture various market segments hoteliers may be associated with several hotel brands that are of different classes. During the acquisition phase of the business cycle a hotelier may use the FRI outputs to target individuals that have appropriate spend capacities for various classes of hotels. During the retention phase the hotelier may use the FRI outputs to determine for example when a particular individual s risk of default decreases. Based on that determination the hotelier can market a higher class of hotel to the consumer in an attempt to convince the consumer to upgrade.

One of skill in the relevant art s will recognize that many of the above described FRI applications may be utilized by other industries and market segments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example the strategy of using FRI to model an industry s best consumer and targeting individuals sharing characteristics of that best consumer can be applied to nearly all industries. FRI data can also be used across nearly all industries to improve consumer loyalty by reducing the number of payment reminders sent to responsible accounts.

Responsible accounts include those who are most likely to pay even without being contacted by a collector. The reduction in reminders may increase consumer loyalty because the consumer will not feel that the lender or service provider is unduly aggressive. The lender s or service provider s collection costs are also reduced and resources are freed to dedicate to accounts requiring more persuasion.

Additionally the FRI model may be used in any company having a large consumer service call center to identify specific types of consumers. Transcripts are typically made for any call from a consumer to a call center. These transcripts may be scanned for specific keywords or topics and combined with the FRI model to determine the consumer s characteristics. For example a bank having a large consumer service center may scan service calls for discussions involving bankruptcy. The bank could then use the FRI model with the indications from the call center transcripts to evaluate the consumer.

Any databases discussed herein may include relational hierarchical graphical or object oriented structure and or any other database configurations. Common database products that may be used to implement the databases include DB by IBM Armonk N.Y. various database products available from Oracle Corporation Redwood Shores Calif. Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server by Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. MySQL by MySQL AB Uppsala Sweden or any other suitable database product. Moreover the databases may be organized in any suitable manner for example as data tables or lookup tables. Each record may be a single file a series of files a linked series of data fields or any other data structure. Association of certain data may be accomplished through any desired data association technique such as those known or practiced in the art. For example the association may be accomplished either manually or automatically. Automatic association techniques may include for example a database search a database merge GREP AGREP SQL using a key field in the tables to speed searches sequential searches through all the tables and files sorting records in the file according to a known order to simplify lookup and or the like. The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function for example using a key field in pre selected databases or data sectors. Various database tuning steps are contemplated to optimize database performance. For example frequently used files such as indexes may be placed on separate file systems to reduce In Out I O bottlenecks.

More particularly a key field partitions the database according to the high level class of objects defined by the key field. For example certain types of data may be designated as a key field in a plurality of related data tables and the data tables may then be linked on the basis of the type of data in the key field. The data corresponding to the key field in each of the linked data tables is preferably the same or of the same type. However data tables having similar though not identical data in the key fields may also be linked by using AGREP for example. In accordance with one embodiment any suitable data storage technique may be utilized to store data without a standard format. Data sets may be stored using any suitable technique including for example storing individual files using an ISO IEC 7816 4 file structure implementing a domain whereby a dedicated file is selected that exposes one or more elementary files containing one or more data sets using data sets stored in individual files using a hierarchical filing system data sets stored as records in a single file including compression SQL accessible hashed via one or more keys numeric alphabetical by first tuple etc. Binary Large Object BLOB stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC 7816 6 data elements stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC Abstract Syntax Notation ASN.1 as in ISO IEC 8824 and 8825 and or other proprietary techniques that may include fractal compression methods image compression methods etc.

In one exemplary embodiment the ability to store a wide variety of information in different formats is facilitated by storing the information as a BLOB. Thus any binary information can be stored in a storage space associated with a data set. As discussed above the binary information may be stored on the financial transaction instrument or external to but affiliated with the financial transaction instrument. The BLOB method may store data sets as ungrouped data elements formatted as a block of binary via a fixed memory offset using either fixed storage allocation circular queue techniques or best practices with respect to memory management e.g. paged memory least recently used etc. . By using BLOB methods the ability to store various data sets that have different formats facilitates the storage of data associated with the financial transaction instrument by multiple and unrelated owners of the data sets. For example a first data set which may be stored may be provided by a first party a second data set which may be stored may be provided by an unrelated second Party and yet a third data set which may be stored may be provided by an third party unrelated to the first and second party. Each of these three exemplary data sets may contain different information that is stored using different data storage formats and or techniques. Further each data set may contain subsets of data that also may be distinct from other subsets.

As stated above in various embodiments the data can be stored without regard to a common format. However in one exemplary embodiment the data set e.g. BLOB may be annotated in a standard manner when provided for manipulating the data onto the financial transaction instrument. The annotation may comprise a short header trailer or other appropriate indicator related to each data set that is configured to convey information useful in managing the various data sets. For example the annotation may be called a condition header header trailer or status herein and may comprise an indication of the status of the data set or may include an identifier correlated to a specific issuer or owner of the data. In one example the first three bytes of each data set BLOB may be configured or configurable to indicate the status of that particular data set e.g. LOADED INITIALIZED READY BLOCKED REMOVABLE or DELETED. Subsequent bytes of data may be used to indicate for example the identity of the issuer user transaction membership account identifier or the like. Each of these condition annotations are further discussed herein.

The data set annotation may also be used for other types of status information as well as various other purposes. For example the data set annotation may include security information establishing access levels. The access levels may for example be configured to permit only certain individuals levels of employees companies or other entities to access data sets or to permit access to specific data sets based on the transaction merchant issuer user or the like. Furthermore the security information may restrict permit only certain actions such as accessing modifying and or deleting data sets. In one example the data set annotation indicates that only the data set owner or the user are permitted to delete a data set various identified users may be permitted to access the data set for reading and others are altogether excluded from accessing the data set. However other access restriction parameters may also be used allowing various entities to access a data set with various permission levels as appropriate.

The data including the header or trailer may be received by a stand alone interaction device configured to add delete modify or augment the data in accordance with the header or trailer. As such in one embodiment the header or trailer is not stored on the transaction device along with the associated issuer owned data but instead the appropriate action may be taken by providing to the transaction instrument user at the stand alone device the appropriate option for the action to be taken. The system may contemplate a data storage arrangement wherein the header or trailer or header or trailer history of the data is stored on the transaction instrument in relation to the appropriate data.

One skilled in the art will also appreciate that for security reasons any databases systems devices servers or other components of the system may consist of any combination thereof at a single location or at multiple locations wherein each database or system includes any of various suitable security features such as firewalls access codes encryption decryption compression decompression and or the like.

Encryption may be performed by way of any of the techniques now available in the art or which may become available e.g. Twofish RSA El Gamal Schorr signature DSA PGP PKI and symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems.

The computing unit of the web client may be further equipped with an Internet browser connected to the Internet or an intranet using standard dial up cable DSL or any other Internet protocol known in the art.
