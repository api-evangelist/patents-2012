title: Television system to extract television product placement advertisement data and to store data in a remote control device
abstract: A television advertisement system whereby a viewer retrieves product placement contact information for a product, that has been promoted on the viewer's television by using a wireless remote control device. The invention provides the means for a viewer to easily obtain in-hand product contact and detailed information which can then be used at-will. Teletext data, which contains product information, is associated with a product's video signal and is automatically decoded and stored in the television's or TV set-top box's memory. The viewer retrieves on demand the product's teletext data stored in memory by using a remote control device. The product data is transferred to and stored in a remote control device's memory. The data is displayed on the remote's screen. The data stored in the remote control can be used to contact an advertiser for further information, or to purchase a product or service. This is achieved by wirelessly transferring pertinent contact information from the remote control to various communication devices, such as a computer, a telephone, a television set-top box, an electronic game console, etc.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 679 206 filed on Oct. 3 2003 which has issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 291 465 on Oct. 16 2012 to which priority is claimed and which is fully incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to a system for receiving television product placement advertisement associated teletext contact data and for a viewer to obtain on demand the teletext contact data in hand using a television remote control device.

Currently product placement is the promotion of branded goods and services within the context of a television show or a movie i.e. in a theater or on a television set rather than as an explicit advertisement. The brand names of product placement are visible to the viewer. Through product placement advertisers hope that viewers will take note of the products used by the cast members and thereby consider using the products themselves.

Whenever a product placement advertisement ad appears on a television TV and the viewer is interested in following up on the promoted product today he must either remember the product which generally displays no contact or detailed information or scribble down the product name on a piece of paper. The problem then is to locate where the viewer can find the product of interest. In today s electronically networked world there are internet search engines such as Google Yahoo etc. to help locate the products of interest. Even this electronic search and locate method is somewhat awkward because a person is presented with many choices regarding the searched and found product and hence must further filter the presented search results for the precise information that the person is looking for.

The current invention uses a readily available feature of TV signals namely teletext. Generally in the USA teletext is not greatly used as it is in Europe and other global regions. In the USA closed captioning CC is commonly available on most TV sets and all TV set top boxes. Closed captioning is a specific use of teletext in the USA i.e. as a government mandated aid to deaf TV viewers.

Product placement advertisement information for example contact data pricing detailed descriptions etc. are embedded by the current invention in a TV or movie signal wherein the product placement advertisement appears as associated teletext data.

Rainsford teaches in U.S. Pat. No. 7 158 676 676 an interactive system that provides a video program with associated interactive content which relates to the content of the displayed video program. The 676 patent does not teach retrieving and storing the interactive content in a television s remote control device nor does it teach the use of teletext for embedding the interactive content of the video. The 676 patent teaches that a viewer interacts immediately with pertinent video content and its associated site on the internet.

Bates et al. teaches in U.S. Pat. No. 6 774 908 908 an interactive system that provides a video program with associated interactive content which relates to the content of the displayed video program. The 908 patent teaches the programmatic locating of images in the stream of video frames after initial image identification and insertion of pertinent associated data. The 908 patent does not teach retrieving and storing the interactive content in a television s remote control device nor does it teach the use of teletext for embedding the interactive content of the video. The 908 patent teaches that a viewer interacts immediately with pertinent video content and its associated site on the internet.

The current invention uses the terms advertisement product placement and product placement advertisement interchangeably i.e. they are used synonymously.

The present invention s primary objective is a system and a method whereby a television TV viewer retrieves contact and or more detailed information for a product placement advertisement that is or has been promoted on the viewer s television by using a wireless device. The promotion of the product need not necessarily be visible to the viewer. For example the advertisement cue could be audio or it could be implied for example a scenic frame could have a travel agent product placement advertisement associated with it.

One of the key premises to advertising is for the advertised product or service to be purchased. The invention provides the means for a viewer to easily obtain an advertisement s contact detailed information in hand which can then be used at will.

The present invention teaches the use of teletext data which is associated with a product s video movie signal which is automatically decoded and stored in the television s or TV set top box s memory.

The viewer can retrieve on demand the product s associated teletext data stored in the television s or set top box s memory by using a wireless remote control device. The advertisement data is transferred to and stored in the remote control s memory. The data is displayed on the remote s screen and or the television s screen. No advertisement data is transmitted to the remote control device without the viewer s explicit interaction.

The viewer can retrieve display retain and delete any advertisement data stored in the remote control s memory at any time even if the TV is switched off. Furthermore the viewer can retrieve display retain and delete any advertisement data stored in the TV s and or TV set top box s memory.

The data stored in the pertinent device s memory can be used to contact an advertiser for further information or to purchase an advertised product or service. This is achieved by wirelessly transferring pertinent contact information from the pertinent device s memory to various communication devices such as a computer a telephone a PDA other electronic devices etc. The contact information can also be used by simply displaying the data on a screen for the viewer to manually use.

Product placement is the promotion of branded goods and services within the context of a television show or a movie i.e. in a theater or on a television rather than as an explicit advertisement. The brand names of product placement are generally visible to the viewer. Product placement is simply another form of advertising in TV shows and movies but does not need a dedicated advertisement time slot. Through product placement advertisers hope that viewers will take note of the products used by the actors and actresses and thereby consider using the products themselves. Unlike explicit advertising product placements do not include any detailed information for example the technical specifications of the BMW Z3 that James Bond is driving in the movie GoldenEye or where to find the Louboutin shoes that a show s actress is wearing or a coupon for the range of makeup products that a show s star is using.

Today rating systems such as Nielsen measure the effectiveness of product placement advertising i.e. the same system that is used to gauge today s television shows audience viewership.

The preferred embodiment of the invention uses a common feature of today s television systems i.e. teletext. Teletext is a technology used to deliver data within an analog video signal by using the vertical blanking interval VBI between lines of active video. The VBI is a generally unused space located between the vertical synch pulse and the actual active video picture. Because of the limited number of available lines in the VBI the actual amount of data that can be transmitted is limited to about 17.76 Kbits sec multiplied by the number of transmitted lines.

Various teletext formats are available including the World System Teletext WST the North American Broadcast Teletext Specification NABTS and others.

The teletext standards used by broadcasters all over the globe are defined in the International Telecommunication Union s ITU R BT.653 2 document. The European teletext is defined as teletext system B for 625 50 Hz TV systems. NABTS teletext is defined as teletext system C for 525 60 Hz TV systems. WST for PAL is defined as teletext system D for 625 50 Hz TV systems and WST for NTSC is defined as teletext system D for 525 60 Hz TV systems.

Semiconductor manufacturers provide video encoders and decoders that encode and decode multiple teletext standards. For example Intersil s HMP8117 decoder handles closed captioning NABTS WTS and BT.653 System B C and D teletext. Cirrus Logic s encoders CS4954 and CS 4955 support closed captioning in NTSC and teletext for NTSC and PAL.

Most modern television sets have built in teletext decoders. For example Sharp Corporation s 19R M100 and Panasonic s CT 36SL13 TVs support closed captioning decoding and display. Hitachi s C50F550 TV system supports teletext decoding and display.

The insertion i.e. encoding of teletext information into video signals is highly developed and is covered by many patents and available commercial products e.g. MRG Systems DTP800 Digital Databridge and CT700 Teletext Scheduler and Optimum Technology s OPT III Teletext Encoder.

Global TV broadcasting is graduating into the digital world a technology without VBI. Analog teletext does not exist in digital television DTV . Digital teletext is available with the evolution of DTV. The current standard for digital teletext is the Multimedia Hypermedia Experts Group open standard called MHEG 5 which is described in the International Organization for Standardization ISO document ISO IEC 13522 5. Another document specifies the method by which ITU R System B Teletext ITU R Recommendation BT.653 also known as EBU Teletext may be carried in DVB bitstreams.

The important thing to note is that the current invention does not exclude digital television DTV broadcasting but uses analog television broadcasting in its preferred embodiment. To those knowledgeable in the art it is obvious that teletext embedded in a digital video signal can be decoded at the viewer s end of the transmission. Many broadcasters e.g. the BBC and BSkyB as well as USA broadcasters have implemented digital systems.

In the invention s preferred embodiment the teletext associated advertisement data stream consists of a number of paired data fields i.e. an identifier tag field and an associated attribute field.

Each advertisement the preferred embodiment considers an advertisement as a block of teletext data is prefixed with a tag to distinguish it from other teletext information such as classic closed captioning or for example weather or flight information available in many European teletext systems. At the end of the advertisement teletext transmission block is a termination tag . These two tags enable the microcontroller to process more easily the advertisement teletext information.

The advertisement teletext block can be considered as a specialty page of teletext data i.e. a sub page of teletext data embedded within a classic as defined for example in the ITU R BT.653 2 document and its digital teletext equivalent teletext page of data.

The format of the teletext advertisement block is as follows and is transmitted left to right top to bottom 

Table 1 further describes the advertisement teletext transmission format. Note that the format of these tags can be other descriptors besides those used in the preferred embodiment of the invention. For example the product s nametag could be NAME or PROD etc. Furthermore the present invention does not exclude the use of other fields for example expiration date time for an advertisement offer e.g. tag or email address e.g. tag etc.

Not all advertisements have data for all of the fields. In this case it can be handled in one of two ways 

 a All of the fields are transmitted and where no data are available the attribute field pair is blank. For example say a product only has a name and a web address and then the advertisement teletext transmission stream is as follows 

 b The second option is such that unused fields are not transmitted. For example say a product only has a name and a web address and then the advertisement teletext transmission is as follows 

The preferred embodiment of the invention uses option b i.e. unused fields are not transmitted. This option saves on encoding the advertisement transmission block decoding process resources TVInfo Memory usage etc.

Referring to the preferred embodiment consists of a television a set top box and a remote control device . A video signal is received by the set top box with embedded teletext data that is associated with a product placement advertisement to be promoted or is being promoted on the TV . The remote control device has a display screen data memory control circuitry transreceiver circuits and buttons to interact with the TV viewer.

Note that all of the functionality of the set top box as previously mentioned could as easily be implemented directly in the TV . The preferred embodiment of the invention does not exclude this implementation in a TV .

The remote control device comprises the following components as illustrated in note that these features may also be implemented directly in a TV and or on a set top box as additionally available buttons or software menu options 

With reference to through a viewer uses a remote control device to interact with a set top box in order to obtain the associated product placement advertisement information for later or immediate use. The advertisement information is retrieved stored in the remote control s NVRAM and displayed on the remote control s screen .

The viewer can review the product placement advertisement information that he has retrieved and stored on his remote control device . The viewer can then contact the product distributor and inquire further or purchase the product or service. Purchasing can be made via 

Universal Electronics has software called Nevo that runs on personal digital assistants PDAs such as the HP iPAQ Pocket PC H3950 and H5400. Nevo software enables the PDA to be used as a remote control device . The Sony Cli PEG NR70v PDA comes with software called Remote Commander that enables the PDA to be used as a remote control device . It is well known in the art that PDAs can be used to connect to the PSTN and to connect to ane Internet via a fax modem card.

Note that the various remote control device buttons could be implemented with relative ease as touch screen options on the remote control device s screen . Various manufacturers of remote control devices have touch screen circuitry. For example the Philips TSU ProntoNEO Intelligent A V remote control has a touch screen display. The preferred embodiment of the invention uses buttons as described above. It is also possible to implement the various remote control buttons directly in the TV and or in the set top box .

Referring to through the initial stage in the current invention s process consists of creating a product placement advertisement with associated embedded teletext information. This stage includes using a video or a movie source a product database and a teletext multiplexer system . The fundamental objective of the invention is to associate information contained in the product database with select images in frame s of the video or movie source .

Today s movies and television shows have a run rate of about 30 frames a second. A single frame can be viewed as a single still photographed image i.e. a movie has a run rate of 30 still photographic images per second. Today television shows are generally 30 thirty 60 sixty and 90 ninety minutes in duration. This means that there are 54 000 54 k 108 000 108 k and 162 000 162 k frames per show which are available for product placement. Not all frames in a show may be used for product placement. For example in broadcast television approximately 25 of a show is dedicated to explicit advertisements i.e. dedicated advertisement time slots. Furthermore a set of frames may simply not have any advertisement content.

Various techniques and commercial products e.g. ClickVision by Creative Frontier are available which facilitate the association and insertion of interactive content i.e. data with a stream of video. U.S. Pat. No. 6 774 908 to Bates et. al. 908 and U.S. Pat. No. 7 158 676 to Rainsford 676 are examples of techniques which may be used to implement this process of the current invention. The 908 and 676 patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

A computer workstation is used to work with the various system components. These components are primarily the video movie source and the product database .

The product database contains all of the data which are available to be associated with the various product placements. Some of this data needs to be fresh i.e. current and up to date. For example if the advertiser is offering a product at a discounted rate for a given time period then this limitation needs to be incorporated. One example of this offer could be a travel vacation package associated with the Mountains Valley frames labels and . The preferred embodiment of the invention implements this initial process in non real time to the broadcasting of the video movie source to the viewer. Generally this step of the product placement process will be executed outside of the broadcasting studio building by a party other than the broadcaster.

Real time insertion of associated product placement data is defined as moments prior to the broadcasting of the video movie source to the viewer. This option is not excluded from the invention but it is not part of the preferred embodiment because this stage of the invention generally requires more time than is available for real time insertion. With greater workstation computer processing power and more efficient software it is feasible to provide real time insertion of associated product placement data in another embodiment of the invention. One example of this other embodiment is the real time closed captioning of news broadcasts in the USA. In this other embodiment the product database could be distributed and physically located outside of the broadcast studio and would be securely interconnected via a network for example the internet .

As soon as the frame of Man Car appears on the video screen the video movie source stream is paused by the operator. The product database is searched via the product list screen for the products which are of interest i.e. as illustrated in in Table 3 Man product list and Table 4 Car product list . All of these products are inserted associated labels and in with the video frames and in by means of software on the workstation and the teletext multiplexer process in . This produces a video frame stream which has the pertinent product placement teletext data inserted e.g. in Video Movie Teletext . For a more detailed description of this process refer to the section titled Fixed Object Capture Application in Bates 908 and the Detailed Description in Rainsford 676.

A note about the product s contact location data in the product database this information could be a street address a specific web site address as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4 or it could be a centralized web site address not illustrated which would redirect the interested viewer either to a location on the centralized web site or to a specific web site. For example the location information in Table 3 could be centralWeb.com ysl suit instead of the illustrated location designapparel.com . The advantage to using a centralized web site location is that time sensitive information can more easily be updated. If a specific web site location was used rather than the centralized web location then the complete product placement process would have to be repeated before the movie video source was re published or re broadcast at a later date or a different locale. The preferred embodiment of the invention includes the capability to use a centralized web site to re direct a viewer to a location where up to date product information is available.

Generally most product placement advertising is for products that are visible to the viewer in the video movie source . The preferred embodiment of the invention provides a second product placement option. This option is for products that are not explicitly visible in the video movie source . For example in the car rental product placement is not visible but an advertiser such as Hertz car rental could advertise their rates for renting the car or any other vehicle. Another example of the second product placement option is the music that is heard during the display of the Man Car frames. A viewer could be interested in the details of the music that he hears e.g. the name of the song the name of the composer etc. and may be interested in knowing where to purchase the soundtrack. A product placement advertisement for audio products can also be inserted not illustrated in in the preferred embodiment of the invention. Another example for the use of product placements in the preferred embodiment of the invention are the use of static billboards see label in and electronic advertising walls not illustrated which for example surround the playing fields in sports such as football tennis golf rugby etc. Other examples for the use of product placements in the preferred embodiment of the invention include advertisements not illustrated on the clothing of sport players advertisements painted on sport playing field turf etc.

When all of the desired frames in the video movie source are associated with the pertinent products available in the product database the resulting multiplexed video movie can then be published e.g. to DVD CD Blue Ray Disk tape etc. or broadcast . This is illustrated in by Publish or Broadcast .

The preferred embodiment of the invention does not include the capability for a viewer to select specific objects in a movie video as taught by Bates 908 and Rainsford 676. For example in Bates 908 x and y coordinates are tracked for each selectable object in a set of frames which enables a viewer to select a specific object in a Playback Mode of Operation . The preferred embodiment of the invention captures and allows the viewer to retrieve and interact with all i.e. simultaneously of the product placement data in any given frame of the movie video see below section 6. Receiving and Storing Product Placement Advertisements . Another embodiment of the invention could provide the capability of specific object selection as taught in Bates 908 and Rainsford 676.

The invention s preferred embodiment provides for an easy in hand retrieval of advertisement information for product placements by a television viewer. With reference to through we now consider this aspect of the invention.

A television is connected to a TV set top box and a remote control device is used to control and interact with the TV s functionality.

Embedded in the invention s set top box are electronic circuits that extract teletext information that has been attached to i.e. embedded in the video signal. depicts a preferred embodiment of the set top box . The preferred embodiment of the invention has used a set top box but as mentioned previously these circuits can be embedded directly into a TV set . One of the reasons for using a set top box is because it is relatively easy to either add a new or upgraded set top box or replace a current set top box in order to use the current invention with old TV sets.

An originating broadcaster via cable television satellite television broadcast television or internet video streaming transmits the video signal or bit stream as in the case of internet video streaming . The video signal or bit stream has been embedded with product placement teletext at an originating point before being transmitted see and the above section 5 Creating Product Placement Advertisements .

When the receiver i.e. the set top box or the TV with embedded decoder circuits receives a video signal via the UHF VHF Tuner and IF circuit the video signal is passed onto the teletext decoder . Note that in the case of an internet bit stream being received the viewer s receiver would have the pertinent electronic circuits not illustrated to process the video bit stream. Examples of computer video cards include ADS Tech s Instant TV FM PCI and Hauppauge s WinTV PVR 150. The preferred embodiment does not discuss further this type of internet bit stream reception but the implementation is straight forward in the current state of the art.

In the preferred embodiment of the invention the teletext decoder and microcontroller are generally part of the same commercially available integrated circuit. For example Philips Semiconductors has an intelligent teletext decoder the SAA5264 and the SAA5265 that incorporate Intel s 80C51 microcontroller. has separated these two circuits for illustrative purposes but the preferred embodiment does not exclude this type of separate circuit implementation.

The teletext decoder extracts the product placement teletext data and any other teletext data available from the video signal and stores it in page memory . Whenever new product placement data is stored in page memory the microcontroller moves the data into separate memory i.e. TVInfo Memory . The preferred embodiment of the invention does not exclude the scenario whereby the microcontroller directly stores product placement teletext data directly into memory TVInfo Memory once it has been decoded from the received television signal. As previously mentioned all product placement teletext data blocks are identified with a start and end tag. Commercially available teletext decoders generally have limited memory to store teletext in. For example the SAA5264 can only store a single page of teletext and the SAA5265 can store ten pages of teletext. Using separate storage memory i.e. TVInfo Memory enables the invention to store more advertisements for later recall by the viewer via the Recall TVInfo button. . TVInfo Memory is implemented as Non Volatile Random Access Memory NVRAM in order to retain advertisement data even if the set top box or TV depending on the implementation of the teletext decoder has been powered down.

It is feasible to store the product placement data in page memory rather than separate TVInfo Memory and to identify it as such by using tags or other methodologies. The preferred embodiment of the invention uses separate memory.

The preferred embodiment of the invention stores product placement data in the TVInfo Memory as it is received in a First In First Out FIFO i.e. as a stack data structure. When the memory is full the microcontroller overwrites the first received and stored product placement data with the newly received data. This feature enables the viewer to browse i.e. navigate any product placements that have been received and previously stored in the TVInfo Memory . The invention does not preclude other data storage techniques such FILO indexed or a relational database etc. from being used.

Once the associated product placement data is stored in the TVInfo Memory it is available for the viewer to download into his remote control device .

The preferred embodiment of the invention automatically i.e. without the viewer s explicit interaction stores all of the frame s product placements associated data together i.e. as a group glob in memory . For example in all of the associated product placement data e.g. Table 3 and Table 4 are stored in memory so that it is retrieved as a whole i.e. simultaneously upon a request by the viewer.

A note about the Id Number tag see Table 1 This tag is used to associate a set of product placements as a group to be accessed by the viewer. For example the suit that the man wears throughout the show generally varies. By tagging each suit that the man wears in the movie with the same Id Number tag e.g. allSuitsMan71 it is possible for a viewer to retrieve a list of all of the suits that the man wears in all pertinent frames of the show. Similarly if all of the cars that the man drives in the show are tagged with the same Id Number tag e.g. 123abc the viewer can then retrieve a list of all of the cars that the man drives in the show. This feature is part of a further embodiment of the invention and is not detailed in the preferred embodiment of the invention.

With reference to through we now consider how the invention enables a viewer to retrieve various types of product placement data stored in TVInfo Memory . We now consider 

 7.a In the first case i.e. a real time display the movie video being displayed on the TV screen has associated product placement teletext data automatically stored in memory on the set top box . In this case the viewer is watching the movie video on a TV and wishes to capture the associated product placement information for use. The preferred embodiment does not provide an indicator that product placement information is available for retrieval by the viewer. Another embodiment of the invention may include a visual indicator that product placement information is available for retrieval by the viewer. For example a graphic icon or text is displayed appropriately in the movie video on the TV screen for example in the top right corner of the screen not shown . In the preferred embodiment of the invention the viewer uses his remote control device to send a request to the set top box via a wireless interface on his remote control device . This is done by selecting the Get TVInfo button located on his remote control device . The set top box has a wireless receiver Rx that captures the viewer s remote control device request and passes this request to the microcontroller to process. The microcontroller then retrieves the product placement data from memory and transmits it to the viewer s remote control device via the wireless transmitter Tx . If no product placement data are available the process returns a pertinent message or an error code that is converted into a displayable message by the remote control device e.g. No Data . Once the remote control device receives the advertisement data it displays the received data on the remote control s screen and stores the data in the remote s memory. For example if the Man Car frame see and is displayed on the TV when the viewer selects the Get TVInfo button all of the associated product placement data see and Tables 3 and 4 that has been stored in memory by the microprocessor is downloaded transmitted to the viewer s remote control device .

 7.b In the second case i.e. the viewer is interested in a previously displayed viewed frame s TV product placements he selects the Recall TVInfo button on the remote control device . The remote control device sends the recall request to the set top box via a wireless interface on his remote control device . The set top box has a wireless receiver Rx that captures the viewer s remote control request and passes this request to the microcontroller to process. The microcontroller then retrieves product placements data which it automatically stored in TVInfo Memory . This information is then displayed on the TV . The viewer browses the displayed advertisement list by using the channel buttons or if applicable the numeric keys on his remote control device . If he locates product placement data that he wishes to retain on his remote control device he selects the Get TVInfo button on the remote control device and it is transmitted via the Tx circuit by the microcontroller to the remote control . The remote control device displays the information on its screen and stores the advertisement data in its memory.

 7.c The third case involves the movie video being played back from published media e.g. a DVD rather than being broadcast to the viewer s TV . Once the source is introduced into the system the teletext decoder and microcontroller process the viewer s request and the video stream as described above in section 7.a .

With reference to through and we now consider how the present invention helps a TV viewer to contact advertisers about a product or service.

Once the viewer has stored product placement data about a product in his remote control device see above section 7. Downloading a Product Placement Advertisement to a Remote Control the viewer can then contact the advertiser.

As mentioned previously the preferred embodiment of the invention groups and stores all of a frame s product placements together see in both the TV Info Memory and the remote control device s memory. The viewer can then browse i.e. navigate the list i.e. the group of product placements which may contain a pertinent product that the viewer is interested in. The preferred embodiment of the invention displays the list group of product placements in a hierarchical structure but does not exclude other types of display structures from being used. So for example in the viewer will initially see only two options on the remote control device s screen i.e. Man and Car together with the actor s name and the car s make and model . The preferred embodiment of the invention does not exclude other data from being displayed at this point but adheres to the rule of simplicity in its design and implementation. The viewer then optionally drills down i.e. navigates further by using the number keys various displayed options may be associated with numbers to facilitate easier navigation and or by using the arrow keys on the remote control device until the desired product is located or not as in the case of no pertinent advertisement being available promoted. For example the viewer selects the Car option and the product information as listed in Table 4 is displayed on the screen . The viewer can now contact the advertiser by 

Note that many TV advertised products do not have a distributor or store to contact but are simply raising the awareness of the viewer to the products availability. Examples for this type of advertising include cosmetic products detergent products motor vehicles political campaigns multi national corporations etc.

Another feature that is not displayed in is that the remote control could have a wireless interface to a printer. This feature would allow the viewer to obtain a hardcopy of the advertised product information that he stored in the remote control . Another feature not displayed in . is the capability of transmitting the displayed information from the remote control to a PDA. Wireless communication between PDAs is common technology in the art.
