Detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. However it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of an invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. Therefore specific functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a representative basis for the claims and or as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.

Module may include a simulated vehicle computing system. The simulated vehicle computing system may simulate the features of an actual vehicle computing system including but not limited to receipt of voice activated commands transmission of spoken responses to the commands generation and transmission of directions communication with one or more peripheral items e.g. and without limitation nomadic communication devices and media players generating wireless connections with one or more devices inside e.g. using BLUETOOTH and outside e.g. via an Internet connection of the vehicle among other features.

For example and without limitation simulated vehicle computing system may include a CPU not shown and a simulated vehicle data bus e.g. and without limitation CAN J1850 and GMLAN . It may also include a simulated on board diagnostics system e.g. OBD I or OBD II . Other aspects of are described below.

In the illustrative embodiment a processor controls at least some portion of the operation of the vehicle based computing system. Provided within the vehicle the processor allows onboard processing of commands and routines. Further the processor is connected to both non persistent and persistent storage . In this illustrative embodiment the non persistent storage is random access memory RAM and the persistent storage is a hard disk drive HDD or flash memory.

The processor may also be provided with a number of different inputs allowing the user to interface with the processor . In this illustrative embodiment a microphone an auxiliary input for input a USB input a GPS input and a BLUETOOTH input are all provided. An input selector may also be provided to allow a user to swap between various inputs. Input to both the microphone and the auxiliary connector is converted from analog to digital by a converter before being passed to the processor .

Outputs to the system can include but are not limited to a visual display and a speaker or stereo system output. The speaker may be connected to an amplifier and may receive its signal from the processor through a digital to analog converter . Output can also be made to a remote BlueTooth device such as PND or a USB device such as vehicle navigation device along the bi directional data streams shown at and respectively.

In one illustrative embodiment the system uses the BlueTooth transceiver to communicate with a user s nomadic device e.g. cell phone smart phone PDA etc. . The nomadic device can then be used to communicate with a network outside the vehicle through for example communication with a cellular tower .

Exemplary communication between the nomadic device and the BlueTooth Trasceiver is represented by signal .

Pairing a nomadic device and the BlueTooth transceiver may be instructed through a button or similar input configuring the transceiver for pairing with a BlueTooth transceiver in a nomadic device.

Data may be communicated between CPU and network utilizing for example a data plan data over voice and or any suitable modulation technique as is well known in the art. Alternatively it may be desirable to include an onboard modem in order to transfer data between CPU and network over the voice band.

In one illustrative embodiment the processor is provided with an operating system including an API to communicate with modem application software. The modem application software may access an embedded module or firmware on the BlueTooth transceiver to complete wireless communication with a remote BlueTooth transceiver such as that found in a nomadic device . In another embodiment nomadic device may include a modem for voice band or broadband data communication. In the data over voice embodiment a technique known as frequency division multiplexing may be implemented when the owner of the nomadic device can talk over the device while data is being transferred. At other times when the owner is not using the device the data transfer can use the available voice channel bandwidth 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz in one example .

Alternatively if the user has a data plan associated with the nomadic device it is possible that the data plan allows for broad band transmission and the system could use a much wider bandwidth speeding up data transfer . In still another embodiment nomadic device is replaced with a cellular communication device not shown that is affixed to vehicle . In yet another embodiment the ND may be a wireless local area network LAN device capable of communication over for example and without limitation an 802.11g network i.e. WiFi or a WiMax network.

In the case of certain temporary data for example the data can be stored on the HDD or other storage media until such time as the data is no longer needed.

Additional sources that may interface with the vehicle include a personal navigation device having for example a USB connection and or an antenna or a vehicle navigation device having a USB or other connection an onboard GPS device or remote navigation system not shown having connectivity to network .

Further the CPU could be in communication with a variety of other auxiliary devices . These devices can be connected through a wireless or wired connection. Also or alternatively the CPU could be connected to a vehicle based wireless router using for example a WiFi transceiver. This could allow the CPU to connect to remote networks in range of the local router .

Referring back to simulated vehicle computing system may be connected e.g. electrically or wirelessly to a nomadic device ND . ND may be without limitation a cellular phone wireless LAN device or a PDA. ND may receive and store directional or route data from a service delivery network SDN using in one non limiting embodiment a data over voice DoV line. The route data received by the ND may be processed and transmitted to the simulated vehicle computing system .

As illustrated in one or more embodiments when a connection arrives at the SDN from e.g. ND it is handled by an Automated Call Distributor ACD . An exemplary illustrative non limiting ACD may consist of hardware for terminals and switches phone lines software for a routing strategy etc.

In this illustrative embodiment the ACD may be a device that may route or distribute incoming calls according to one or more routing strategies. Routing strategies may be a rule based set of instructions that instruct the ACD on the handling of calls inside the SDN so that the best available resources for an incoming call or connection can be identified. Non limiting examples of routing strategies may include routing calls to terminals used by one or more operators interactive voice response IVR systems that communicate with callers or modem pools for extracting electronic data and other non limiting resources.

In addition to an ACD a call control gateway CCG may be provided to manage the resources of the ACD and aid in resource allocation to incoming calls connections. Other resources assigned to the network may also be managed by a CCG .

For example in one illustrative embodiment the CCG may create a unique session identification number and may utilize that number to be able to transfer a call between various resources depending on for example the caller s needs within the SDN . Accordingly calls that need to be moved between the various components of the SDN may be assigned monitored and serviced through a CCG through e.g. rules and tables created by the CCG .

A system administration manager SAM may also be provided to the SDN . Among other things the SAM may be responsible for the security and certification of users callers applications and the services on the SDN . The SAM may have direct access to a customer database and may be responsible for allowing or denying services to callers based on for example criteria assignable to each caller s account.

The SAM may also be used to pull reports records usage patterns both locally and remote etc. The SAM may also be able to store and update individual user records. These records can be used in a variety of fashions including ACD intelligent call routing and charging for chargeable services.

As stated above one of the applications to which a call may be routed is the IVR system . The IVR system may be an automated telephone information system that speaks to a caller using a combination of fixed voice menus and data extracted from a database in real time. For example the system may welcome the caller with the fixed word hello followed by the caller s name Susan that it dynamically pulled from a database.

The caller may respond to questions and menus presented by the IVR by speaking or pressing keyed buttons. Additionally a spoken command by the caller may be translated by the simulated vehicle communication system and sent in the form of a DTMF tone for a particular key. The caller may also be able to speak short phrases which may be understood by the IVR.

In one embodiment voice portals systems fronted by speech recognition software may be designed and integrated into an IVR to help a user obtain desired information.

Another service to which the calls may be routed is a data over voice DOV provider . The DOV providers may provide a mechanism to send and receive data across a voice channel.

In addition to the listed network components the SDN may be connected to a Network Provider Backend . This backend may provide system services and may also be used by the network provider to directly access the system.

Also connected to the SDN in this illustrative embodiment may be information services to provide requested information to callers a POI database to provide points of interest to drivers a routing engine to assist with navigation directions a traffic database to provide traffic information and operators to assist callers.

In one embodiment the SDN may connect to one or more of these additional services through WANs where one or more of these services may be provided by alternative providers. It should be understood however using one or more of the WAN connection s the components described above may together comprise the SDN .

Referring back to system may also include network which may be a wired or wireless broadband connection. Non limiting examples of a wireless connection may include WiFi e.g. an 802.11 standard connection or WiMax.

A non limiting example of a mapping service is one offered by Google Inc. such as GOOGLE EARTH. The mapping service may transmit mapping data to terminal . Mapping data may include but is not limited to GPS data and map data i.e. graphical representations of maps .

Map data may be displayed or otherwise provided at terminal to follow the route which is being tested. In one embodiment terminal may serve as a GPS puck for receiving and transmitting GPS data received from the mapping service . Furthermore terminal may be used to validate the route of the directions being tested.

Terminal may be connected to the simulated vehicle computing system via wired e.g. and without limitation a USB connection or wireless e.g. and without limitation BLUETOOTH connection for simulating aspects of . Terminal may also be connected to simulated vehicle computing system using an on board diagnostics e.g. OBD I or OBD II interface for receiving commands from and transmitting commands to a controller area network CAN or other data bus within the simulated vehicle computing system . For example as will be described in further detail below the one or more GPS signals received from the mapping service may be transmitted to the CAN via e.g. an OBD II interface for receiving GPS data at the simulated vehicle computing system .

As illustrated without limitation system may have installed navigation simulation software . Alternatively the navigation simulation software may be installed on terminal . In one non limiting embodiment the navigation simulation software may receive one or more inputs from a user for simulating a drive along the route. The inputs may include but are not limited to keyboard inputs mouse clicks and voice commands. As the user simulates the drive described below location changes to the GPS data may be transmitted to the simulated vehicle computing system . At each change the simulated vehicle computing system may output a new directional step from one or more speakers. Alternatively or additionally the new directional step may be outputted to terminal . The output may be text based e.g. displayed at terminal or an audible output e.g. and without limitation a machine spoken output . The simulation software may be stored to non volatile memory of system or alternatively within terminal .

It should be understood that while illustrates communication between system and terminal the exemplary topology is for illustration and clarity purposes and therefore the architecture of system is non limiting. For example the various embodiments described herein may operate on system or terminal without deviating from the scope of the invention. Furthermore there may be one or more of system and or terminal .

The mapping service may include an application programming interface API through which the navigation simulation software may communicate with the mapping service in order to use one or more mapping functions.

If one or more errors exist in the system s navigation the user may generate corrections for the errors as illustrated in block . In an alternative embodiment corrections may be defined by terminal based on basic principles of travel and navigation in view of the available navigation options.

A non limiting example of an error for which a correction may be generated may include the system failing to output a particular turn while navigating the route i.e. either in response to user input or during playback . As illustrated in block error correction may include electronically transmitting the corrections to a third party for correction. Error correction may also include but is not limited to re programming navigational software to cure the one or more errors or transmitting the corrections to navigational software as updates or fixes. 

In one embodiment as illustrated in block one or more error logs and or error correction logs may be generated. The logs may be stored to terminal or one or more servers not shown in communication with system .

GPS information from the mapping service may be received automatically or manually e.g. via user input for determining starting location information. In one embodiment the same or separate mapping data may also be used to retrieve starting location information for the route data from the SDN . Thus as illustrated in block starting location information may also be determined.

As illustrated in block the route data may be received from the SDN . In one embodiment the route data may be received by the ND . The ND may store the route data in non persistent or volatile memory not shown . The route data may be transmitted to the simulated vehicle computer system as illustrated in block .

Simulation software may test the routing data based on geographic coordinates i.e. latitude and longitude received from the SDN representing the routing data. With reference to as the virtual vehicle moves along a route simulation software may receive the coordinates of the vehicle based on the map data. Simulation software may compare the moving coordinates of the vehicle with the coordinates associated with the routing data to test the system s accuracy in navigating the route. If a discrepancy is determined between the coordinates of the routing data and the coordinates received from mapping service software may generate a log of errors. The log may be reviewed by a user for error correction as described above. Alternatively the software may correct the route error based on mapping information. The correction may be based on available information on the street route s to the destination specified. Where multiple routes are available methods are known in the art to rank and select the fastest and or most suitable route.

In one embodiment software may be programmed with instructions for automatically generating one or more route issues in order to automatically test route issues as described with respect to .
