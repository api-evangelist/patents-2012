title: Cross-platform presence
abstract: Systems, methods, and computer program products for providing cross-platform presence are described. In some implementations, a cross-platform presence server can be provided that allows a caller to accurately assess the availability and other similar status of a callee by evaluating a device status of a plurality of communication devices associated with the callee. The cross-platform presence server can then determine, based on these device statuses, whether a callee is available. The availability of the callee can subsequently be displayed to the caller (e.g., on the caller's phone), or any other individuals who have been granted permission by the callee to be notified of the callee's availability.

In a communication system suitable for voice calls a callee s presence or status can typically be known by the caller after a voice call is made. For example if the dial tone is busy the callee is on the phone. A caller may also determine the presence of a callee by monitoring the callee s busy lamp. For example if the callee s busy lamp signals red the callee is likely to be on the phone and therefore not available to take an incoming call.

A voice call can be made by a variety of communication devices. Example communication devices may include desk phones cellular phones softphones and smartphones. Different communication devices can use different communication services for communications. For example a desk phone may use a fixed line phone service to communicate through a public switched telephone network PSTN a cell phone or a smartphone may use a mobile telephony service to communicate through a cellular network and a softphone may use a broadband service to communicate though a broadband network. In some cases a voice service user may use more than one communication device. Since the communication services used by different communication devices are often distributed rather than centralized a unified presence of the voice service user may not be available to other users in the communication system.

A plurality of communication devices associated with a user profile are identified by a service provider where the user profile is associated with a subscriber subscribing to telecommunication services provided by the service provider. The service provider monitors inbound and outbound communications for each of the plurality of communication devices and determines a device status associated with each of the plurality of communication devices based in part on the monitored inbound and outbound communications. A user availability of the subscriber is determined by the service provider based on an aggregate of the device statuses associated with the plurality of communication devices and the user availability on one or more receiving devices is displayed.

Systems methods and computer program products for providing cross platform presence are described. In some implementations a cross platform presence server can be provided that allows a caller to accurately assess the availability and or status of a callee by evaluating a device status of one or more communication devices associated with the callee. The cross platform presence server can then determine based on these device statuses whether a callee is available. The availability of the callee can subsequently be displayed on various devices e.g. on the caller s desk phone mobile phone tablet computer etc. of individuals who have been granted permission by the callee to be notified of the callee s availability e.g. secretary co worker colleague supervisor caller etc. .

Generally the call state of a callee can be used to determine whether a call should be transferred to the callee. For example when a secretary of a manager considers whether to call or transfer a call to the manager in a business environment it is useful for the secretary to understand the call state of the manager. Example call states include on the phone phone is ringing do not disturb unavailable busy out of office away from desk at home mobile traveling and other similar statuses. In some cases the secretary services an incoming call by reading a busy lamp field BLF on the secretary s telephone corresponding to the manager s phone line that indicates whether the manager s phone line is in use. For example a blinking red light on the manager s BLF may indicate that the manager s phone line is in use which means that the manager is likely busy. Similarly a green light on the manager s BLF may indicate that the manager s phone line is not occupied and the manager is likely available. In another example a yellow light on the manger s BLF may indicate that the manager is not near the manager s desk phone e.g. as determined by manager s mobile device GPS IP address or WiFi network location but the manager is available through the manager s mobile device e.g. as determined by state of applications running on the manager s mobile device indicating that the manager is out of office or away from desk but available over the manager s mobile device.

A call state associated with a particular communication device of the callee does not always represent the actual availability or presence of the callee. For example a constant green light that indicates a callee s desk phone is not in use does not necessarily mean that the callee is available to talk since the callee can be communicating on another device e.g. texting instant messaging or calling on a mobile phone . Therefore understanding the communication states of the callee s various communication devices is useful to decide how to communicate with a callee.

The detection of a unified cross platform presence across various communication devices of a callee allows incoming calls to be serviced more expeditiously and efficiently. For example the unified cross platform presence as described herein allows office workers to identify the availability of other office workers without having to call walk to or instant message the co workers to be contacted. As another example the unified cross platform presence as described herein reduces hold time and hang ups by customers by quickly routing customer related calls to an available representative which facilitates a shorter hold time for customers while allowing lesser customer related calls to be transferred to representatives who are unavailable to service such calls. As yet another example the unified cross platform presence as described herein increases executives productivity by having administrators e.g. secretaries or office managers service all calls to the executives with a more accurate knowledge of the executives availability.

As will be described in greater detail below with respect to a business telephony system can be used to provide cross platform presence and associated information. The business telephony system can include without limitation a database that can store registration information of users of the business telephony system subscriber user extension information associated with each user user security authorization information rules for calculating and presenting business presence and other information associated with providing cross platform presence. The business telephony system can also include a telephone access server TAS responsible for tracking status of calls across different platforms of the system one or more session initiation protocol SIP servers for routing calls from communication devices and a presence server that can convert protocols across different platforms and calculate a unified presence of a system user based on the status obtained from other components of the system. The business telephony system can include other components for the purpose of providing cross platform presence.

An example process of obtaining cross platform user statuses is described by way of the following example. When a user picks up a desk phone whose number for example is registered to the business telephony system to make a call the call can be directly forwarded to the business telephony system. The business telephony system can route the call to the intended callee associate the calling device to the caller and start tracking and updating status of both the caller and the callee. For example the business telephony system can automatically update the status of the caller associated with the desk phone as busy as soon as the desk phone is in use even if other communication devices associated with the caller are available for use. Further as will be described in greater detail below the presence update of the caller can be automatically forwarded to and displayed on communication devices of other users who are permitted to monitor the status of the caller.

Communication devices that can be registered and tracked by the business telephony system can include without limitation any communication device such as a desk phone cellular phone smartphone softphone laptop or any associated applications or services including for example communications scheduling or calendar applications. The device statuses of all communication devices associated with a registered user can be stored in a database included in or communicably coupled to the business telephony system . To determine a presence of a user the business telephony system can first gather all the status information associated with the user s communication devices e.g. retrieve the status information from the database . Where the statuses across the various communication devices are different from each other the business telephony system can calculate a cross platform status based on a set of rules that define a hierarchy of the statuses and priorities . The priority of a status in the hierarchy can be based on the importance of the status. A status that is higher in the hierarchy can override a status that is lower in the hierarchy. For example the status do not disturb can override the status busy or away from desk. As another example the status busy can override the status available. For example when a user s status is do not disturb on one communication device and available on another communication device the cross platform presence of the user can be shown as do not disturb. 

In some implementations the business telephony system can also gather status information from applications or services associated with the user including for example a user s communications accounts social media accounts calendar accounts or messaging accounts. The business telephony system can present the user with an option to share status from those applications or services and the user can provide login information and credentials to the business telephony system so it can gather status information from those applications or services. The user can then specify the priority of the status information from the applications services and communications devices.

Besides determining cross platform presence of a user based on the priority of call statuses in some implementations the cross platform presence may also be determined based on one or more characteristics of the call on different communication devices associated with the user. The one or more characteristics can include the importance of the call. For example a call placed on an office desk phone for business uses can be set to have a higher priority than a call placed on a cell phone for personal uses . In this example when a user is busy on a cell phone the cell phone call may be interrupted if there is a call to the desk phone. In another example the determination of whether the call may be interrupted may be based on the identity of the individual communicating with the user e.g. personal calls may be interrupted while business calls may not or the user s mode of communication e.g. instant messaging may be interrupted while telephone calls may not . In some implementations the same call status can be categorized into different sub statuses for different communication devices. For example when a service user is calling on an office desk phone the status of the user may be identified as busy do not interrupt . When the service user is calling on a personal cell phone the status of the user may be identified as busy can interrupt . In some implementations the busy do not interrupt status can override the busy can interrupt status. Furthermore the different sub statuses may be identified based on different BLF presences on the respective communication devices. For example a smartphone with a rich display can show the status busy do not interrupt on a BLF as red and show the status busy can interrupt as yellow. Alternatively the smartphone can directly show that another user is on a business call or a personal call.

In some implementations the communication device user can customize the rules for calculating and or displaying his her cross platform status. For example a user may have a personal cell phone registered to a cross platform presence server . However the user may not want the status of the cell phone to override any of the statuses of other communication devices associated with the user. In such case the user can define a rule that restricts the personal cell phone from reporting status to the presence server or automatically set the statuses of the personal cell phone with the lowest priority. In some implementations the user can define the set of devices as well as applications or services from which the user s cross platform presence may be calculated. For example the user may select an office phone mobile phone softphone or other device or application e.g. Microsoft Outlook account from which the user s cross platform presence may be calculated. The user may also define priorities and rules between those devices and applications for calculating cross platform presence e.g. Microsoft Outlook calendar availability overrides device availability or softphone activity results in busy can interrupt status .

In some implementations the cross platform presence of a service user can be manually set by the service user through the use of an application programming interface API . In some implementations a status manually set by a service user can have the highest priority and override any other call statuses. For example even if a user is free of use of any of his her communication devices if the user manually set his presence as do not disturb his her cross platform presence can be shown as do not disturb. In another example the API may be used by authorized individuals to retrieve the user s cross platform presence in addition to setting the user s cross platform presence.

In some implementations the cross platform presence information may include metadata including more detailed status information which may be available to different service users based on their respective privileges. When a general default cross platform presence information of a user is shown to a caller the caller may request the presence server for more detailed status information regarding the user s presence. The presence server may send status information with a granularity level based on the privileges of the requestor. For example if the cross platform presence of a user is shown as busy to a caller the caller may request the presence server for more detailed information with respect to this status. If the caller can be authenticated by the presence server the presence server may send more detailed information to indicate that the user is in a meeting or on a business trip. In some implementations the presence server can also automatically authenticate the caller and directly provide the caller with cross platform presence information with a corresponding granularity.

As described above the cross platform status can be calculated for a service user in various ways. In some implementations the cross platform status can be calculated for a group of users who are registered to the service e.g. corporate department . For example a customer service department of a company can have a group of customer service representatives CSRs . The CSRs may be placed in a queue to provide customer services to customers based on a time order. When a customer calls in to reach a customer service representative the system or corporate receptionist can use the cross platform availability of the customer service department to determine whether the customer can be immediately served. In this example as long as at least one CSR is available the cross platform presence of the customer service department can be shown as available instead of exposing the availability of the individual CSRs. In some implementations the members of a group from which cross platform presence may be calculated may be set by an administrator.

Table 1 shows a list of example functions that can be provided using cross platform presence information.

Referring to an example business telephony system is shown. The example system can be a service provider that offers various communications related services to subscribers. Such users can include individuals or employees within a company organization or other business entities. Example users can also include administrators receptionists and office users.

As shown the example system can include a presence server a signaling media control SMC a TAS a telephony answering machine TAM a network a busy lamp field BLF monitor SIP servers a platform API a computer a database and one or more communication devices. The communication devices operating in the example system can include for example desk phones cell phones softphones and smartphones . The presence server SMC TAS and TAM are communicably coupled to each other and included in a soft switch of the example system .

The presence server can collaborate with one or more other components of the soft switch such as the TAS to monitor connections and communications across one or more communication devices. Also the presence server can determine a presence of a user based on tracking types of the subscribers and subscriber devices provided by other soft switch components. Although shown as one presence server in the soft switch also can include more than one presence server for scalability purposes. Further the presence server can monitor presences of more than one user who is subscribed to the example system . Each presence server can be responsible for managing presence for at least a portion of the users operating in the example system . The presence server can also grant permissions to user extensions to use cross platform services provided by the example system .

The soft switch can include call processing logic that can monitor user status across different platforms e.g. voicemail email MMS SMS other platform based communications communications applications social networking applications or scheduling applications . For example the presence server can be configured by default to operate with SIP protocol communication devices. Traditional analog communication devices can still be monitored such as when using an adapter that can translate information across different platforms at the presence server . The soft switch can perform a variety of functionalities. For example the soft switch can hold calls decide how to route calls when to play a greeting when to connect a call when to ring when to hang up or to perform any other call related logic.

Similarly the TAS can keep track of the status of calls made by the subscribers of the example system. The TAS can also associate calling status of a subscriber to a user extension based on a user subscriber information list stored in the database.

The TAS can include an SMC and a TAM . The TAM can update the presence server with respect to the state of calls. The communication between the TAM and the presence server can be based on an active telephony control protocol TCP connection. For any of the communication devices e.g. service subscribers when there is a status change or an activity performed e.g. a number is being dialed or a call is made or terminated by a subscriber the updates can be cached in a database . In some implementations a system snapshot regarding the latest statuses of communication devices can be taken periodically or based on a system update. The TAM can stream information associated with the system snapshot to one or more presence servers in parallel to maintain load balancing across different presence servers . Each presence server can parse the information received and determine status information that relates to an extension of the example system associated with the presence server . Each presence server can include subscriber information of the entire example system . In some implementations each presence server can store status updates for a subset of subscribers associated with that particular presence server .

The SMC can interact with media on the Internet through a media server not shown in order to allocate media resources. The SMC can also function to bridge calls across subscribers operating on different protocols based on a business logic associated with the presence server .

As discussed above information associated with providing user presences can be stored in a database . Such information can include for example business level call forwarding logic service tasks a set of rules for determining user presence user classes and call status classes billing capabilities and other information associated with the calls. Further the database can store registry information of the users subscribers. Information stored in the database can be used to provide a database centric solution for providing cross platform user presence.

The database can include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component. Database may store various objects or data including classes frameworks applications backup data business objects jobs web pages web page templates database tables repositories storing business and or dynamic information and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto associated with the purposes of the example system . Additionally the database can include any other appropriate data such as VPN applications firmware logs and policies firewall policies a security or access log print or other reporting files as well as others.

Although shown as one BLF monitor in the example system can include more than one BLF monitor . At least one BLF monitor can be associated with a user and or a communication device. The BLF monitor can provide presence information to the user based on preferences of the user and or permission for monitoring presences from other users. One or more BLF monitors can be associated with a presence server based on load balancing within the example system . The BLF monitor can monitor the state of calls and subscribers associated with the calls. In some implementations the BLF monitor is associated with a web user interface UI . In some implementations a BLF agent can also forward subscribed messages monitored on the BLF monitor from subscribers to its associated presence server . For example the BLF agent can forward information regarding which subscribers are on a call to its associated presence server .

The SIP servers or SIP proxies can operate with subscribers using a SIP protocol. SIP is an Internet Engineering Task Force IETF defined signaling protocol used for controlling communication sessions such as voice and video calls over Internet Protocol IP . The SIP protocol can be used for creating modifying and terminating two party unicast or multiparty multicast sessions. Sessions can include one or several media streams. The SIP server can also operate with the SMC to locate user associated media resources on the Internet.

The SIP servers can initiate or break down a call understand subscribed messages sent from subscribers and send the subscribed messages to the presence server . The SIP servers can also work as load balancers of the example system .

The SIP servers can connect to different types of devices over IP to the soft switch . For example the SIP server can connect subscribers including IP enabled desk phones cell phone and softphone . The SIP server can connect to a smartphone and a computer e.g. Mac computer or PC . In addition to the digital communication devices as described above the SIP server can also connect to analog devices. For example at least one of the desk phones can be a traditional analog phone. The SIP server can forward calls from analog phones to digital communication devices in the example system . In some implementations communication devices such as desk phones cell phones softphones smartphones and computers can directly communicate with the soft switch though the network . For example desk phones with Internet Protocol IP capabilities smartphones and or softphones can directly connect though the Internet to the presence server without going through the SIP servers . In some implementations the presence of the communication devices that communicate directly with the soft switch though the network can be determined based on using cross platform presence applications. For example a smartphone user can indicate his her current status by using a cross platform presence application to send out a text message directly to the presence server.

The SIP servers can be communicably coupled to the soft switch through the network such that the presence server can be aware of the connections across different types of communication devices. For example when a user is traveling in his car and is making a call through the SIP server the user s status can be shown as busy on the user s administrator s phone or any device that has the permission to monitor the user. In some implementations without modifying the basic functions of a SIP server the presence server can include a cross platform presence adaptor that understands presence of SIP subscribers and other types of devices in the example system . In some implementations a platform API can be used in conjunction with the presence adaptor to translate presence information across platforms. The platform API can also be in direct communication with the BLF monitor . In some implementations the BLF monitor can monitor subscriber status updates directly from the platform API .

Mobile devices such as a cell phone smartphone mobile computer tablet etc. can be communicably coupled to the soft switch through the network such that the presence server can be aware of the location of the mobile devices and status of applications on the mobile devices. For example when a user is away from his desk phones his location can be determined by the location of his mobile device using the GPS IP address or WiFi network locations of the mobile device and the user s status can be determined to be away from desk. In another example when the user is at home as determined by the location of his mobile device the user s status can be determined to be home or do not disturb. In some implementations the mobile device can be communicably coupled to the soft switch through the network using a mobile application installed on the mobile device that shares information about the location and usage of the mobile device.

Although call statuses are described in the above description the cross platform presence can be determined based on types of services or any form of presence status information that can be communicated through the network . For example that status associated with online chatting applications online calendar applications and or social network status used by a user may be reported to or pulled by the presence server for the determination of the user s cross platform presence. As for another example when a user is joining a web based conference or having a calendar appointment the corresponding statuses may be automatically or selectively reported to or pulled by the presence server for the determination of the user s cross platform presence. It will be understood that the priority of these statuses as compared to the priority of call statuses can be determined based on a set of rules stored at or accessible by the presence server or customized by the service user. Furthermore the various presence statuses information can be uploaded reported by the communication device users through any suitable API. In some implementations the service user can determine which sources e.g. communication devices and or services of presence status data to be reported. The service user can also determine which sources of presence status data are allowed to be pulled by the presence server based on using an API.

The presence server and the SIP servers can be any servers that host one or more applications suitable for performing their respective functionalities. At a high level a server comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive transmit process store or manage data and information associated with the example system . The SIP servers can be any computer or processing device such as for example a blade server general purpose personal computer PC Macintosh workstation UNIX based workstation or any other suitable device. Further illustrated servers can be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux UNIX Windows Mac OS or any other suitable operating system. According to one embodiment servers can also include or be communicably coupled with a mail server.

The network can be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network while in another instance at least a portion of the network can represent a connection to the Internet. In some implementations a portion of the network can be a virtual private network VPN . Further all or a portion of the network can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links can include 802.11a b g n 802.20 WiMAX Bluetooth and or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words the network encompasses any internal or external network networks sub network or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment. The network can communicate for example Internet Protocol IP packets Frame Relay frames Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM cells voice video data and other suitable information between network addresses. The network can also include one or more local area networks LANs radio access networks RANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs all or a portion of the Internet and or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations.

The communications between the components of the system as illustrated in are generally bidirectional. For example not only the communication devices can report upload status information to the presence server they can also retrieve download status information from the presence server or the presence server can push feed status information to the communication devices.

While is described as containing or being associated with a plurality of elements not all elements illustrated within example system of can be utilized in each alternative implementation of the present disclosure. Additionally one or more of the elements described herein can be located external to example system while in other instances certain elements can be included within or as a portion of one or more of the other described elements as well as other elements not described in the illustrated implementation. Further certain elements illustrated in can be combined with other components as well as used for alternative or additional purposes in addition to those purposes described herein.

Optionally the user can enter a temporary disposable number in place of or in addition to the identifier to access the user account. After completing the identifier and password information in the appropriate fields the user can proceed to log into the account by selecting the login button on the user interface . In some implementations the user can set up the application to remember the identifier and password and automatically populate the requisite fields when the user invokes the application. An option to create a new account also can be presented as a button or a link that invokes a different user interface where a user can enter requisite information to create and activate a new account.

It will be understood that although allowing other users to see my presence is shown to be an On and Off choice in this example in some implementations a cross platform presence application may include a list of service users such that the application user can select which service users to share his her status with. For the service users who the application user does not share his her presence with the application user may not be shown on their communication devices or may be shown as unavailable. 

Although the presences of two users are shown in the example user interface B the presences of any number of users can be accommodated by a user interface. For example for a desk phone a sidecar can be added to expand the display of the user interface to accommodate more user presences. For a smartphone or a softphone a list of user presences can be shown by the corresponding application on more than one tab page. Furthermore it will be understood that the presence of a user may be displayed in various ways based on the capability of the communication devices. For example a softphone may use text icons animations or voices to indicate a user s presence. In some implementations more sophisticated communication devices can show a presence history of a user in addition to the current status of a user.

At a plurality of communication devices applications or services associated with a user profile can be identified. The user profile can be associated with a subscriber subscribing to telecommunication services provided by a service provider.

At inbound and outbound communications for each of the plurality of communication devices are monitored.

At a device status associated with each of the plurality of communication devices are determined based on the monitored inbound and outbound communications and optionally location information of a device.

At a user availability of the subscriber is determined based on an aggregate of the device statuses associated with the plurality of communication devices and optionally the state of applications or services associated with the user profile.

The computing device may be implemented in a number of different forms as shown in the figure. For example it may be implemented as a cellular telephone . It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone personal digital assistant or other similar mobile device.

A few implementations have been described in detail above and various modifications are possible. The disclosed subject matter including the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in electronic circuitry computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them such as the structural means disclosed in this specification and structural equivalents thereof including potentially a program operable to cause one or more data processing apparatus to perform the operations described such as a program encoded in a computer readable medium which can be a memory device a storage device a machine readable storage substrate or other physical machine readable medium or a combination of one or more of them .

The features described can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. In some implementations the apparatus can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable storage device for execution by a programmable processor and method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the described implementations by operating on input data and generating output. In other implementations the apparatus can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier for execution by a programmable processor. In some implementations the information carrier can include a propagated signal.

The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from and to transmit data and instructions to a data storage system at least one input device and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used directly or indirectly in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.

Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and the sole processor or one of multiple processors of any kind of computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to communicate with one or more mass storage devices for storing data files such devices include magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and optical disks. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in ASICs application specific integrated circuits .

To provide for interaction with a user the features can be implemented on a computer having a display device such as a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.

The features can be implemented in a computer system that includes a back end component such as a data server or that includes a middleware component such as an application server or an Internet server or that includes a front end component such as a client computer having a graphical user interface or an Internet browser or any combination of them. The components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include e.g. a LAN a WAN and the computers and networks forming the Internet.

The term system encompasses all apparatus devices and machines for processing data including by way of example a programmable processor a computer or multiple processors or computers. The system can include in addition to hardware code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question e.g. code that constitutes processor firmware a protocol stack a database management system an operating system or a combination of one or more of them.

A program also known as a computer program software software application script or code can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages or declarative or procedural languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a standalone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

While this specification contains many specifics these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what can be claimed but rather as descriptions of features that can be specific to particular implementations. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features can be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination can be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

In addition the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown or sequential order to achieve desirable results. In addition other steps can be provided or steps can be eliminated from the described flows and other components can be added to or removed from the described systems. Accordingly other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing can be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations.

A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.
