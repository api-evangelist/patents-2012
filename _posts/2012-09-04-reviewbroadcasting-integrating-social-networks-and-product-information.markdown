A large and growing population of users enjoy entertainment through the consumption of media items. Often times these media items are purchased via the Internet from websites of content providers. As part of an online purchase experience presented to a consumer a content provider may present a web page including details regarding a content item provided by the content provide. The details may include a title description and price of the item. In addition reviews and recommendations associated with the item may be presented.

It is increasingly common for consumers to demand up to date and accurate feedback information regarding content items that may potentially be purchased by the customer. A consumer is more likely to be a repeat customer to a content provider s website if the website can provide feedback and reviews that are relevant to the consumer. However it can be problematic to meet this level of demand associated with feedback data.

One problem is that it is difficult for a content provider to obtain reviews from all previous consumers of a product resulting in a partial feedback set that may be skewed to a certain type of consumer e.g. an unhappy consumer . Another problem is that it is difficult to cull from the entire set of provided reviews to present the particular reviews that are relevant to an individual consumer. For example a consumer that is a parent may be interested in just those reviews provided from other parents with a similar experience as the purchasing parent e.g. similar location ages of children level of education etc. . However such social mapping of experiences of consumers cannot be easily obtained or filtered by the website.

Embodiments of a method and apparatus are described for a reviews broadcasting mechanism integrating social networks and product information. In one embodiment a reviews broadcasting mechanism of a content provider identifies one or more social network data entries received from at least one social network provider that are related to a content item. A content item may be for example books music movies TV shows CDs DVDs games and so on either in a physical form or an electronic format. Social network entries may be for example status updates twitter feeds postings on a profile page of the social network etc.

The reviews broadcasting mechanism parses the identified social network data entries to identify feedback information associated with the content item. For example the social network data entries may be mined for age based review information content type review information and or other situational based information. The customized feedback module generates a single feedback result based on the feedback information identified in the social network data entries. The aggregated feedback result may be for example a most recommended age by reviewers of a product a most prevalent content type rating for the product and so on.

In another embodiment a customized feedback module of a reviews broadcasting mechanism receives social network data entries from a social network provider and parses the social network data entries to identify one or more of the social network data entries that are related to a content item. The customized feedback module also parses the identified social network data entries to identify feedback information within the entries and adds the identified feedback as a record in a feedback table. Furthermore the customized feedback module receives an indication from a user to view only feedback from members of a social circle of the user. The customized feedback module then generates a feedback result from the records in the feedback table that are associated with the members of the social circle of the user and presents the feedback result to the user.

The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems components methods and so forth in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art however that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.

The user devices may be portable computing devices such as electronic book readers or tablet computers e.g. that include a book reader application . Other examples of portable computing devices include laptops cellular telephones personal digital assistants PDAs portable media players netbooks and the like. The user devices may also be non portable computing devices such as a desktop computer a set top box associated with a television a gaming console and so on.

In one embodiment the user devices are variously configured with different features to enable consumption of one or more types of digital content and electronic media items. Furthermore user devices may include a web browser application not shown to enable the purchase of content items physical content items or electronic content items from a content provider. For example the web browser application may enable a user of user device to visit a web site of a content provider to purchase or rent or obtain via mutual agreement content items from the content provider. The obtained content items may then be provided to the user via mail or electronic delivery depending on the type of obtained content.

In some embodiments the content provider system may correspond to any feature or combination of features for providing media items electronic or physical or other digital content to the user devices . The content provider system may include a network accessible server based functionality content providing server various data stores and or other data processing equipment. In some embodiments the content provider system acts as a purchasing intermediary for providing physical versions of media items e.g. books CDs DVDs game cartridges etc. via mail delivery. The content provider system may be implemented by a single machine or a cluster of machines. The content provider system may include one or more machines e.g. one or more server computer systems routers gateways etc. that have processing and storage capabilities to provide the server based functionality.

In one embodiment the content providing server corresponds to an entity which provides a plethora of various types of content items e.g. books music movies TV shows CDs DVDs games and so on . In another embodiment the content providing server corresponds to an entity that provides electronic content items e.g. electronic books digital music digital movies etc. to users upon the users purchase of the items. In this role the content providing server may essentially act as a bookseller or the like. In yet other embodiments the content providing server corresponds to an entity which provides electronic content items to users on a non fee basis or on the basis of some other type of alternative compensation arrangement. Thus the term a provider of items should be construed broadly to encompass educational institutions governmental organizations libraries non profit organizations retailers auction services and so on or some cooperative combination of any two or more entities.

The content providing server may deliver and the user devices receive electronic publications or other media items search results upgrades and or other information via the network . For example the user devices may download or receive ebooks from the content providing server . The content providing server may also receive various requests e.g. search queries instructions and other data from the user devices via the network .

Communication between the user devices and the content provider system may be enabled via any communication infrastructure. One example of such an infrastructure includes a combination of a wide area network WAN and wireless infrastructure which allows a user to use the user devices to purchase digital content e.g. electronic publications and consume the digital content without being tethered to the content provider system via hardwired links. The wireless infrastructure may be provided by one or more multiple wireless communications systems. In one embodiment the wireless communication system may be a wireless fidelity WiFi hotspot connected with the network . Wireless communication system may also be a wireless carrier system that can be implemented using various data processing equipment communication towers etc. Alternatively or in addition the wireless carrier system may rely on satellite technology to exchange information with the user devices .

The communication infrastructure may also include a communication enabling system that serves as an intermediary in passing information between the content provider system and the wireless communication system. The communication enabling system may communicate with the wireless communication system e.g. a wireless carrier via a dedicated channel and may communicate with the content provider system via a non dedicated communication mechanism e.g. a public Wide Area Network WAN such as the Internet .

In addition to wirelessly connecting to wireless communication system user devices may also wirelessly connect to other user devices . For example user device may form a wireless ad hoc peer to peer network with user device using WiFi Bluetooth or other wireless communication protocols.

In one embodiment content providing server may include customized feedback module . Customized feedback module may generate and broadcast customized feedback results associated with a content item viewed by a user of user device . In one embodiment customized feedback module interacts with a social network provider to generate the customized feedback results.

Social network provider may provide a social network service for a plurality of end users. A social networking service may be an online service platform or site that focuses on facilitating the building of social networks or social relations among people who for example share interests activities backgrounds or real life connections. A social network often includes a representation of each user often a profile his her social links and a variety of additional services e.g. email and instant messaging . In one embodiment the social network is provided by a same organization providing the content item.

Many social networks are web based and provide means for users to interact over the Internet such as e mail and instant messaging. Types of social networks may include but are not limited to those that contain category places such as former school year or classmates means to connect with friends usually with self description pages a recommendation system linked to trust and a blogging platform that is customizable to following particular users. Some social networks are a combination of one or more of the above types.

In one embodiment customized feedback module polls the social network provider for data in order to mine feedback information from that data. The feedback information may be related to one or more content items provided by the content provider system . For example the feedback information may be a user s discussion of a book movie music or other product sold by a content provider. This discussion may include a user s recommendation of the product and for example a suggested appropriate age of a user of the product. In another example the user s recommendation may include terms such as violence or profanity that relate to a content based review of the product.

In some embodiments the social network provider provides a streaming application programming interface API that allows the content provider system to receive and or monitor a continuous stream of social network data from the social network provider . The social network data may include status updates tweets and other posts made by users of the social network provider . In one embodiment the customized feedback module and or the social network provider notify users of the types of information that may be stored transmitted and or utilized by the customized feedback module and the social network provider and provides the user the opportunity to opt out of having such information stored and or accessible by and or shared with the customizable feedback module and or social network provider .

The customized feedback module may be programmed with search terms that are used to identify and aggregate product feedback provided by social network users using the social network provider . The search terms may be used to identify feedback for a particular product shared by users of the social network provider . In one embodiment the search terms include but are not limited to a unique hashtag associated with the content provider system a product identification ID number e.g. International Standard Book Number ISBN or other Standard Identification Number and a title name of the product.

For example in one embodiment a unique hashtag may be associated with products or a subset of products of the content provider system . A hashtag is a word or phrase that may be prefixed with the symbol to form a metadata tag that identifies groups and or topics. When a social network user adds this hashtag to their social network message e.g. status update tweet etc. the hashtag then identifies the information in the message as associated with the content provider system or in some cases a subset of products of the content provider system . In addition a product ID number and or title may be used to identify a particular product of the content provider system discussed in the social network data provided by the social network provider . In some embodiments the unique hashtag does not have to be included in the social network data in order to identify the data as associated with a particular product. As such the product ID information alone may be utilized to identify product relevant social network data entries.

In one embodiment the social network data stream from the social network provider is searched for the unique hashtag and product ID information and any entries that may be relevant to feedback for a product of the content provider system are identified. These identified social network data entries may then be mined by the customized feedback module for information that is relevant to the feedback such as a recommended age for a product a content type of the product situational information of the product e.g. helpful for a child in 3grade math trends of the product e.g. popularity emerging trend and so on.

In one embodiment the information relevant to the feedback can then be aggregated together to provide a consensus review for the product. For example age recommendations provided via social network provider for a product can be aggregated and an age identified by a predetermined percentage of the social network data entries determined. This aggregated feedback result may then be displayed as the most recommended age for the product on a product page website associated with the product.

In one embodiment the aggregated feedback result may be further customized to only include identified feedback from social network users that are a part of a social circle of the user. The social circle may refer to individuals indicated as one or more of known trusted or followed by the user that is viewing the product. Constructs of a social circle may differ between various social network providers . This allows users to view feedback that is limited to individuals that the user has indicated they trust.

In some embodiments of the invention the content providing server also includes a user interface UI module configured to generate a widget to display the customized feedback generated by customized feedback module on the product web page. A widget may refer to a graphical user interface GUI that displays an information arrangement changeable by the user such as a window or a text box. The widget provides a single interaction point for the direct manipulation of a given kind of data.

In other embodiments the UI module may also provide a survey form in the widget. The survey form may allow a user to submit product feedback from the product details web page directly to a platform of the social network provider of the user. As a result a user may share their feedback on the product web page and with their social circle on the social network provider . In some embodiments the widget of the UI module is continuously updated with a product s latest feedback identified by the customized feedback module using the social network provider data entries.

In some embodiments product feedback data may be provided free form from devices such as mobile phones. A Short Message Service SMS or other simple interface may be utilized to provide structured data that can be parsed and matched as described above. In such an embodiment the delivery of these free form messages is supported by a gateway device or a cellular carrier.

Some embodiments of the customized feedback module and UI module are described in greater detail below with reference to .

Content metadata store may contain information about each electronic media item that is offered by content providing server to the users of user devices . Content metadata store may contain bibliographic information about each item such as author title identifier e.g. International Standard Book Number ISBN Standard Identification Number publisher publication date physical copy and electronic copy length etc. Content metadata store may also include other information about each item such as price readability information e.g. Automated Readbility Index Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Flesch Kincaid Grade Level Gunning Fox Index language topics abstract etc. Content metadata store may also include a popularity classification e.g. a glance view GV status indicative of the popularity of an electronic media item.

Electronic content store may store copies of electronic media and or digital content items that are available e.g. immediately for transmission to a user device upon purchase or rental or other agreement from the content providing system . The electronic media items and digital content may include electronic books ebooks such as electronic textbooks and or other electronic publications electronic versions of publications such as electronic magazines digital newspapers digital audio books electronic journals real simple syndication RSS feeds etc. The media items may also include digital video e.g. movies television short clips etc. images e.g. art photographs etc. audio files and multi media content.

Feedback store may store copies of parsed social network data that has been identified as relevant feedback. In one embodiment the feedback store may be a NoSQL database using a key value storage model.

Referring back to customized feedback module the social network data poll parse module of the customized feedback module may connect to one or more APIs provided by one or more social network providers in order to poll and or search for data from the one or more social network providers. In one embodiment the API from a social network provider may include a streaming API that maintains a state of the communication connection between the social network provider and the content provider system so that just new information is passed to the content provider system.

Upon receipt of new social network data social network poll parse module may parse the data using search terms provided from search term module to identify social network data entries related to a content item of content provider system. Search term module may be programmed by an administrator with various search terms used to identify the potentially relevant social network data entries. As previously discussed the search terms may include but are not limited to a unique hashtag associated with the content provider system a product identification ID number e.g. International Standard Book Number ISBN of a content item and or a title name of a content item. In one embodiment one or more of the search terms may be obtained from the content metadata store .

In one embodiment when social network data entries are identified as related to a content item by social network poll parse module the feedback mining module mines these identified entries for feedback information. In one embodiment the feedback mining module is programmed by an administrator of the content provider system to search for a particular type of feedback. Types of feedback may include but are not limited to age based reviews content type reviews e.g. violence profanity etc. trends based reviews e.g. popularity emerging trends etc. situational reviews e.g. helpful for 3grade math etc. product integration based reviews e.g. works does not work with certain devices product life span reviews e.g. lasted 6 months etc. and so on.

The feedback mining module may use search terms such as a regular expression of age to identify the specific feedback type information that may be provided in the identified social network data entries. For products where an attribute of the product is most important e.g. fragrance for perfumes social network data can be aggregated around that particular attribute and feedback related to that attributed parsed from the social network data. The following examples provide details of specific use cases of collecting feedback for particular product types.

In a first example for luggage bag products often dimensions are mentioned but there are no references to how well the bag may fit in a travel compartment e.g. overhead bin in an aircraft . In some cases the dimensions are not wholly accurate because for example wheels might not be included while measuring dimensions. Therefore the customer feedback information relaying real world use examples of the bag s dimensions is informative for feedback purposes

In another example for cameras lens products customer feedback for the product may focus on whether the camera lens should be owned as a primary lens or a secondary lens. In this case there is no negative side to the feedback instead the feedback just provides a number to boost confidence in buying the product. This type of feedback is similar to measuring aggregating positive recommendations.

In an additional example for MP3 MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 Audio Layer III digital audio products there are some songs that are very popular and have multiple versions e.g. regular non filtered version and filtered version . The feedback for an MP3 product can relate to profane words in the song so that customer feedback indicating that a high percentage of the customers would rather buy the filtered version of the song indicates that the MP3 product is high in profanity.

After the feedback mining module has mined feedback data from the identified social network data entries this data is added to the feedback table that stores of the mined feedback data for the customized feedback module . The feedback table maintains an ongoing collection of reviews culled from received social network data in a table format. Each entry in the feedback table may include information such as the product ID the user providing the feedback date of feedback a type of the feedback the feedback specific data and so on.

In some embodiments the feedback mining module may also filter the mined feedback to view just social network data originating from members of a user s social circle. In one embodiment a social circle is specific to constructs of the particular social network provider and may include individuals a user follows individual that a user has indicated they trust and so on. This type of filtering allows a user to view feedback that originates from individuals that the user has agreed to connect with. In some embodiments such a filter may provide more relevant or at the least a different kind of feedback that is consistent with a background and or experience of the user accessing the feedback. In one embodiment the customized feedback module may utilize social network log in information provided by the user as well as information provided by the social network provider to identify the social network data entries from individuals that are part of the user s social circle. One skilled in the art will appreciate that customizable privacy policies may be implemented to allow a user to control how data associated with the user is used and or obtained.

In one embodiment the feedback mining module utilizes the collection of information to generate an aggregated feedback result for a content item. For example for an age based review the feedback mining module may determine an age that is suggested by at least 70 of the reviewers social network users . This determined age is then provided to the UI module for display on the product web page. As another example for a content type based review social network users may rate violence on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of increasing violence. The feedback mining module may then determine the average number from 1 5 from all the identified feedback entries and provide this average as the violence rating to be displayed on the product information page by the UI module. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of aggregation algorithms may be utilized to generate an aggregated feedback results and that embodiments of the invention are not limited solely to the above described examples.

In one embodiment the aggregated feedback result is stored in the feedback store . In addition the aggregated feedback result may be supplied to a UI module such as UI module of to present in a feedback widget on a product information web page associated with the corresponding content item. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the aggregated feedback result may be utilized for more than a product information webpage. For instance the aggregated feedback may be provided as one of potentially many inputs into parental control logic implemented by a user device such as user device of . In other embodiments the aggregated feedback may be utilized in a customizable buying guide as part of a search results filter for merchandizing and so on.

Referring to at block method establishes a connection with a social network provider. In one embodiment the connection is established via a streaming API provided by the social network provider. The streaming API provides continuously updated social network data including for example user status updates twitter feeds and so on. At block social network data is received from the social network provider via the established connection.

At block the received social network data is parsed to identify entries related to a content item of the content provider. In one embodiment at least one of a unique hashtag associated with the content provider a product ID number and or a product title name are searched for within the received social network data entries. In some embodiments a combination of the unique hashtag and one or both of the product ID and product title name are used to identify an entry as related to a content item. In another embodiment the hashtag is not used as a search term to identify a data entry as related to a content item.

At decision block it is determined whether any of the social network data entries are identified as related to a content item of the content provider. If so then the identified social network data entries indicated as related to a content item are passed to a feedback mining module at block . Some embodiments of operations performed by the feedback mining module are described below with respect to . On the other hand if an entry is not identified as related to a content item of the content provider at decision block then the entry is discarded at block .

Referring to at block method receives a social network data entry identified as related to a content item of a content provider. In one embodiment the social network data entry is passed to the feedback mining module from a social network poll parse module of the customized feedback module. At block the received social network data entry is mined for feedback. In one embodiment the social network data entry is searched for pre determined terms related to a specific feedback type search. Feedback type searches may include but are not limited to age based reviews content type reviews e.g. violence profanity etc. trends based reviews e.g. popularity emerging trends etc. situational reviews e.g. helpful for 3grade math etc. product integration based reviews e.g. works does not work with certain devices and so on.

At block any feedback information mined from the social network data entry is added to a feedback table maintained by the customized feedback module. Then at block an aggregate feedback result is generated from the entries in the feedback table. In one embodiment the aggregated feedback process fetches all entries in the feedback table related to a content item and uses feedback type information from the fetched entries to generate the aggregated feedback result. For example as described above one aggregated feedback result may use an age amount that is listed in at least 70 of the feedback entries for a content item in the feedback table.

Lastly at block the aggregated feedback result is provided to a UI module of the customized feedback module for further use by the content provider. In some embodiments the UI module may use the aggregated feedback result for display in a widget on a product details web page of the content item see e.g. described below as part of a customized buying guide for a user a part of a search results filter offered by the content provider as feedback for parental control logic offered by the content provider for merchandizing purposes of the content provider or to provide information back to a manufacturer of a product to help them determine how to market or describe their offering based on usage data by a test group to name a few examples.

Referring to at block method receives an aggregate feedback result for a content item. In one embodiment the aggregated feedback result is generated using methods and of described above. In another embodiment a feedback mining module of the customized feedback module provides the aggregate feedback result to the UI module.

Then at block a widget associated with the content item is one of added or updated with the aggregate feedback result on a product details webpage of the content item. is a screenshot depicting one embodiment of a widget that may be displayed on a product details web page for a content item. Any social network provider may be integrated with widget .

In addition widget includes an aggregated feedback comments area that displays all of the social network data entries that were identified and used to generate the aggregated feedback result . In one embodiment a radio button may be selected to allow a user to view feedback from only members of the user s social circle. In yet another embodiment the widget includes a feedback button that when selected generates another UI one embodiment detailed in allowing the user to share feedback about the content item associated with the product details web page.

This is correlated to block of where a survey is displayed in the UI widget that requests a user s feedback on the content item. is a screenshot depicting one embodiment a feedback widget to receive user feedback to provide directly to a user s social network. In one embodiment feedback widget is generated when the feedback button described in is selected. As discussed above any social network provider may be integrated with feedback widget . In one embodiment feedback widget includes a feedback survey question directed to a particular feedback type in this case age based review . In addition feedback widget may include a text entry box to allow users to input free text related his her opinion of the content item.

The user may then select a commit button to submit the feedback survey information to a social network of the user. In one embodiment this feedback survey information is automatically populated with a unique hashtag associated with the content provider and a product ID number of the content item which will both appear with the user inputted survey information on the user s profile page on the social network provider. In one embodiment the feedback survey information is then part of the social network data that is polled and or monitored by the customizable feedback module and eventually integrated as part of the aggregated feedback score for the content item.

Referring back to at block the received feedback via the survey UI is caused to be transmitted to the social network provider. In one embodiment this transmission is part of an API from the social network provider to the content provider that ties the social network provider platform into the web platform of the content provider.
