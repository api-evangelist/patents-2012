The present disclosure relates to a system for producing a digital holographic DH content and more particularly to a system for producing a digital holographic content for systematizing and efficiently operating all processes including acquisition generation edition restoration of the digital holographic content and production of an application content on a pipeline.

In the related art in regard to an analog hologram a hologram is optically recorded on a special film by projecting a laser which is a coherent light source to a target object which is used for a limited purpose such as restoration of a specific object such as cultural assets for display at an exhibit hall. A similar hologram technique is an image production technique of a stereo scheme in which a 3D image is formed in a space by using a projector and a reflecting mirror without considering an optical property of the hologram. The similar hologram technique is incapable of solving dizziness and a feeling of fatigue at the time of viewing a 3D image which is caused in a binocular disparity scheme.

Meanwhile in the related art since methodology of generating the digital holographic content itself in real time by computer generated hologram CGH processing is limited problems caused at the time of viewing the 3D image cannot be fundamentally solved. Further there is a limit without a function to efficiently generate and manage the 3D image for the specialized use in various application fields.

The present disclosure has been made in an effort to provide a system and a method for producing a digital holographic DH content for consistently and systematically processing the digital holographic content from an initial generation step to a final application content production step in order to apply a digital hologram to various application fields and solve a problem of an existing binocular 3D image technique.

Further the present disclosure has been made in an effort to provide a system and a method for producing a digital holographic content for efficiently operating the digital hologram in order to manage a process in terms of processing the content by systematizing all processes including acquisition generation edition restoration image quality evaluation human factors of the digital holographic content and production of an application content by using a process pipeline defined as systematical and physical parameters.

An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a system for producing a digital holographic DH content which includes a 3D image information acquiring unit configured to acquire 3D information on real and virtual objects a computer generated hologram CGH processing unit configured to generate the digital holographic DH content by mathematical modeling from the 3D information acquired from the 3D image information acquiring unit a DH content editing unit configured to edit the generated digital holographic content a DH image restoring unit configured to visualize the generated digital holographic content in a 3D image and a digital holographic content process managing unit configured to manage a parameter and a processing time of each functioning unit so as to process each processing process of the 3D image information acquiring unit in a pipeline scheme the computer generated hologram processing unit the digital holographic content editing unit and the digital hologram image restoring unit.

According to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure a series of processes including generation edition and production of a digital hologram can consistently and efficiently processed on a DH content process management pipeline and production of the digital hologram specialized for each application field and production of a content optimized for user system requirements of a target application content can be predictably achieved after pre verification by a simulation function.

Further dizziness and a feeling of fatigue at the time of viewing a 3D image can be fundamentally removed which is caused from a stereo scheme based on a binocular scheme in 3D image processing technology in the related art and a series of processes from generation of a 3D image content to production of an application content can be consistently and seamlessly processed and operated in one system.

That is dizziness and a feeling of fatigue of viewer s eyes can be fundamentally excluded by making the most of a characteristic of the digital hologram and a 3D image service that makes the most of a characteristic of an application field can be efficiently implemented at lost cost in a short time while the 3D image is generated.

In addition all the processes for processing the digital holographic content which include generation and edition of the digital holographic content and production of an applied hologram content are pipelined to be consistently processed on a process management system so as to construct a user created content UCC environment in which the digital hologram can be efficiently used by a content producer and a content user in various application fields.
