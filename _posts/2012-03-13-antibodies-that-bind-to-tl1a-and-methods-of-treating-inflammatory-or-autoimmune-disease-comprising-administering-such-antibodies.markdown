The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating disease in a subject comprising blocking the interaction between DR3 and TL1A and compositions comprising the same.

DR3 TRAMP LARD WSL 1 TNFRSF25 is a tumor necrosis receptor family member expressed specifically on T cells that is most similar to TNFR1. The ligand for DR3 is TL1A a TNF family member protein reported to be expressed by endothelial cells. TL1A can costimulate T cell activation in vitro but the physiological sources of TL1A and its in vivo role in peripheral T cell biology are not known.

Interactions between numerous TNF family ligands and receptors play an important role in shaping specific features of T cell responses. A subfamily of TNF receptors including CD30 TNFR2 OX40 CD27 GITR HVEM and 4 1BB are expressed on T cells and mediate distinct aspects of costimulation in specific T cell subsets Croft 2003 . For example OX40 potentiates post activation survival of activated CD4 T cells Croft TNFR2 costimulates CD8 T cell activation and GITR has a unique role in regulatory T cells. DR3 TNFRSF25 TRAMP LARD WSL 1 is a death domain containing TNF family receptor that like its closest homolog TNFR1 recruits TRADD and has the ability to activate NF kB and MAP Kinases or alternatively trigger caspase activation and programmed cell death on the cellular context. Unlike TNFR1 DR3 is specifically expressed in lymphocytes with the highest levels on T cells. However the function of this receptor in T cell homeostasis is not well understood particularly since the authentic ligand for this receptor TL1A was only recently identified. Initial reports suggested that TL1A was expressed exclusively on endothelial cells and addition of exogenous TL1A was reported to costimulate IL 2 and IFN production by human T cells stimulated though the TCR Papadakis et al. 2004 Papadakis et al. 2005 . More recently TL1A has also been found at sites of inflammation such as in inflammatory bowel disease Bamias et al. 2003 Bamias et al. 2006 .

In accordance with the purpose of this invention as embodied and broadly described herein this invention relates to compositions and methods for treating an inflammatory or autoimmune disease in a subject comprising blocking the interaction between DR3 and TL1A.

Provided is a method of treating an inflammatory or autoimmune disease in a subject comprising blocking the interaction between DR3 and TL1A.

The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can be blocked by reducing endogenous DR3 levels activity or availability. The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can also be blocked by reducing endogenous TL1A levels activity or availability. The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can be blocked using agents that directly interfere with the interaction between the two molecules. For example direct interference can be affected by an agent that binds to DR3 at its binding site for TL1A or an agent that binds to TL1A at its binding site for DR3. Typically this binding would competitively interfere with the ability of the other molecule to bind at that site.

Protein levels activity or availability can be affected by modulating for example the transcription translation translocation ubiquitination phosphorylation glycosylation or propeptide cleavage of the peptide.

For example endogenous levels of TL1A can be reduced using functional nucleic acids such as antisense RNAi siRNA ribozymes or aptamers.

Functional nucleic acids are nucleic acid molecules that have a specific function such as binding a target molecule or catalyzing a specific reaction. Functional nucleic acid molecules can be divided into the following categories which are not meant to be limiting. For example functional nucleic acids include antisense molecules aptamers ribozymes triplex forming molecules RNAi and external guide sequences. The functional nucleic acid molecules can act as affectors inhibitors modulators and stimulators of a specific activity possessed by a target molecule or the functional nucleic acid molecules can possess a de novo activity independent of any other molecules.

Functional nucleic acid molecules can interact with any macromolecule such as DNA RNA polypeptides or carbohydrate chains. Thus functional nucleic acids can interact with the mRNA of TL1A or the genomic DNA of TL1A or they can interact with the polypeptide TL1A. Alternatively functional nucleic acids can interact with the mRNA of DR3 or the genomic DNA of TR 3 or they can interact with the DR3 polypeptide. Often functional nucleic acids are designed to interact with other nucleic acids based on sequence homology between the target molecule and the functional nucleic acid molecule. In other situations the specific recognition between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule is not based on sequence homology between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule but rather is based on the formation of tertiary structure that allows specific recognition to take place.

Antisense molecules are designed to interact with a target nucleic acid molecule through either canonical or non canonical base pairing. The interaction of the antisense molecule and the target molecule is designed to promote the destruction of the target molecule through for example RNAseH mediated RNA DNA hybrid degradation. Alternatively the antisense molecule is designed to interrupt a processing function that normally would take place on the target molecule such as transcription or replication. Antisense molecules can be designed based on the sequence of the target molecule. Numerous methods for optimization of antisense efficiency by finding the most accessible regions of the target molecule exist. Exemplary methods would be in vitro selection experiments and DNA modification studies using DMS and DEPC. It is preferred that antisense molecules bind the target molecule with a dissociation constant K less than or equal to 10 10 10 or 10. A representative sample of methods and techniques which aid in the design and use of antisense molecules can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 135 917 5 294 533 5 627 158 5 641 754 5 691 317 5 780 607 5 786 138 5 849 903 5 856 103 5 919 772 5 955 590 5 990 088 5 994 320 5 998 602 6 005 095 6 007 995 6 013 522 6 017 898 6 018 042 6 025 198 6 033 910 6 040 296 6 046 004 6 046 319 and 6 057 437.

Aptamers are molecules that interact with a target molecule preferably in a specific way. Typically aptamers are small nucleic acids ranging from 15 50 bases in length that fold into defined secondary and tertiary structures such as stem loops or G quartets. Aptamers can bind small molecules such as ATP U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 146 and theophiline U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 737 as well as large molecules such as reverse transcriptase U.S. Pat. No. 5 786 462 and thrombin U.S. Pat. No. 5 543 293 . Aptamers can bind very tightly with K s from the target molecule of less than 10M. It is preferred that the aptamers bind the target molecule with a Kless than 10 10 10 or 10. Aptamers can bind the target molecule with a very high degree of specificity. For example aptamers have been isolated that have greater than a 10 000 fold difference in binding affinities between the target molecule and another molecule that differ at only a single position on the molecule U.S. Pat. No. 5 543 293 . It is preferred that the aptamer have a Kwith the target molecule at least 10 100 1000 10 000 or 100 000 fold lower than the Kwith a background binding molecule. It is preferred when doing the comparison for a polypeptide for example that the background molecule be a different polypeptide. Representative examples of how to make and use aptamers to bind a variety of different target molecules can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 476 766 5 503 978 5 631 146 5 731 424 5 780 228 5 792 613 5 795 721 5 846 713 5 858 660 5 861 254 5 864 026 5 869 641 5 958 691 6 001 988 6 011 020 6 013 443 6 020 130 6 028 186 6 030 776 and 6 051 698 The term synthetic aptamer means an aptamer or aptameric sequence that is not heretofore known to occur in nature and function as a biological recognition site or an aptamer conjugate.

Ribozymes are nucleic acid molecules that are capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction either intramolecularly or intermolecularly. Ribozymes are thus catalytic nucleic acids. It is preferred that the ribozymes catalyze intermolecular reactions. There are a number of different types of ribozymes that catalyze nuclease or nucleic acid polymerase type reactions which are based on ribozymes found in natural systems such as hammerhead ribozymes U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 334 711 5 436 330 5 616 466 5 633 133 5 646 020 5 652 094 5 712 384 5 770 715 5 856 463 5 861 288 5 891 683 5 891 684 5 985 621 5 989 908 5 998 193 5 998 203 International Patent Application Nos. WO 9858058 by Ludwig and Sproat WO 9858057 by Ludwig and Sproat and WO 9718312 by Ludwig and Sproat hairpin ribozymes for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 631 115 5 646 031 5 683 902 5 712 384 5 856 188 5 866 701 5 869 339 and 6 022 962 and tetrahymena ribozymes for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 595 873 and 5 652 107 . There are also a number of ribozymes that are not found in natural systems but which have been engineered to catalyze specific reactions de novo for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 580 967 5 688 670 5 807 718 and 5 910 408 . Preferred ribozymes cleave RNA or DNA substrates and more preferably cleave RNA substrates. Ribozymes typically cleave nucleic acid substrates through recognition and binding of the target substrate with subsequent cleavage. This recognition is often based mostly on canonical or non canonical base pair interactions. This property makes ribozymes particularly good candidates for target specific cleavage of nucleic acids because recognition of the target substrate is based on the target substrates sequence. Representative examples of how to make and use ribozymes to catalyze a variety of different reactions can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 646 042 5 693 535 5 731 295 5 811 300 5 837 855 5 869 253 5 877 021 5 877 022 5 972 699 5 972 704 5 989 906 and 6 017 756.

Triplex forming functional nucleic acid molecules are molecules that can interact with either double stranded or single stranded nucleic acids. When triplex molecules interact with a target region a structure called a triplex is formed in which there are three strands of DNA forming a complex dependent on both Watson Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing. Triplex molecules are preferred because they can bind target regions with high affinity and specificity. It is preferred that the triplex forming molecules bind the target molecule with a Kless than 10 10 10 or 10. Representative examples of how to make and use triplex forming molecules to bind a variety of different target molecules can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 176 996 5 645 985 5 650 316 5 683 874 5 693 773 5 834 185 5 869 246 5 874 566 and 5 962 426.

External guide sequences EGSs are molecules that bind a target nucleic acid molecule forming a complex and this complex is recognized by RNase P which cleaves the target molecule. EGSs can be designed to specifically target a RNA molecule of choice. RNAse P aids in processing transfer RNA tRNA within a cell. Bacterial RNAse P can be recruited to cleave virtually any RNA sequence by using an EGS that causes the target RNA EGS complex to mimic the natural tRNA substrate. WO 92 03566 by Yale and Forster and Altman Science 238 407 409 1990 .

Similarly eukaryotic EGS RNAse P directed cleavage of RNA can be utilized to cleave desired targets within eukarotic cells. Yuan et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 8006 8010 1992 WO 93 22434 by Yale WO 95 24489 by Yale Yuan and Altman EMBO J 14 159 168 1995 and Carrara et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 2627 2631 1995 . Representative examples of how to make and use EGS molecules to facilitate cleavage of a variety of different target molecules be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 168 053 5 624 824 5 683 873 5 728 521 5 869 248 and 5 877 162.

Gene expression can also be effectively silenced in a highly specific manner through RNA interference RNAi . This silencing was originally observed with the addition of double stranded RNA dsRNA Fire A. et al. 1998 Nature 391 806 11 Napoli C. et al. 1990 Plant Cell 2 279 89 Hannon G. J. 2002 Nature 418 244 51 . Once dsRNA enters a cell it is cleaved by an RNase III like enzyme Dicer into double stranded small interfering RNAs siRNA 21 23 nucleotides in length that contain 2 nucleotide overhangs on the 3 ends Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Genes Dev. 15 188 200 Bernstein E. et al. 2001 Nature 409 363 6 Hammond S. M. et al. 2000 Nature 404 293 6 . In an ATP dependent step the siRNAs become integrated into a multi subunit protein complex commonly known as the RNAi induced silencing complex RISC which guides the siRNAs to the target RNA sequence Nykanen A. et al. 2001 Cell 107 309 21 . At some point the siRNA duplex unwinds and it appears that the antisense strand remains bound to RISC and directs degradation of the complementary mRNA sequence by a combination of endo and exonucleases Martinez J. et al. 2002 Cell 110 563 74 . However the effect of iRNA or siRNA or their use is not limited to any type of mechanism.

Short Interfering RNA siRNA is a double stranded RNA that can induce sequence specific post transcriptional gene silencing thereby decreasing or even inhibiting gene expression. In one example an siRNA triggers the specific degradation of homologous RNA molecules such as mRNAs within the region of sequence identity between both the siRNA and the target RNA. For example WO 02 44321 discloses siRNAs capable of sequence specific degradation of target mRNAs when base paired with 3 overhanging ends herein incorporated by reference for the method of making these siRNAs. Sequence specific gene silencing can be achieved in mammalian cells using synthetic short double stranded RNAs that mimic the siRNAs produced by the enzyme Dicer Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Ui Tei K. et al. 2000 FEBS Lett 479 79 82 . siRNA can be chemically or in vitro synthesized or can be the result of short double stranded hairpin like RNAs shRNAs that are processed into siRNAs inside the cell. Synthetic siRNAs are generally designed using algorithms and a conventional DNA RNA synthesizer. Suppliers include Ambion Austin Tex. ChemGenes Ashland Mass. Dharmacon Lafayette Colo. Glen Research Sterling Va. MWB Biotech Esbersberg Germany Proligo Boulder Colo. and Qiagen Vento The Netherlands . siRNA can also be synthesized in vitro using kits such as Ambion s SILENCER siRNA Construction Kit. In certain examples siRNAs are directed against certain target genes such as the TL1A gene or the DR3 gene.

The production of siRNA from a vector is more commonly done through the transcription of short hairpin RNAs shRNAs . Kits for the production of vectors comprising shRNA are available such as for example Imgenex s GENESUPPRESSOR Construction Kits and Invitrogen s BLOCK IT inducible RNAi plasmid and lentivirus vectors. Disclosed herein are any shRNA designed as described above based on the sequences for the herein disclosed inflammatory mediators.

Plasmids include antisense sequences that recognize one or more of the sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 or a sequence that encodes a protein listed in SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4. For example cDNA fragments or variants coding for a host protein involved in viral infection are PCR amplified. The nucleotides are amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase Stratagene and cloned in antisense orientation in a vector such as a pcDNA vector InVitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The nucleotide sequence and orientation of the insert can be confirmed by sequencing using a Sequenase kit Amersham Pharmacia Biotech .

For example dominant negative mutants can consist of a truncated cytoplasmic domain of DR3 lacking the death domain that recruits FADD or point mutations in this region that abrogate FADD binding. Dominant negative constructs such as this have successfully blocked signaling by related receptors such as Fas.

Likewise dominant negative mutants of TL1A can be engineered to bind wild type subunits of the TL1A trimer but not bind ligand as previously described Steed et al. 2003 .

Another strategy for dominating inhibition could employ a pre ligand assembly domain PLAD as described for TNFR1 and Fas in U.S. Pat. No. 7 148 061 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for the teaching of PLADs.

The PLAD for DR3 can comprise as few as 38 amino acids of the N terminus of the mature DR3 receptor polypeptide. A mature receptor polypeptide does not include a signal sequence. Thus a polypeptide having the sequence R PLAD Ris provided. Examples of PLADs of DR3 include

When Rand or Ris a peptide this peptide can vary in length. For example Rand or Rcan be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 or more amino acids in length.

The PLAD containing polypeptide can be from 35 125 amino acids in length. In a further aspect the entire polypeptide comprising the isolated TNF like PLAD can be no more than 125 amino acid residues and can thus be 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 or 125 amino acids in length. Rand Rcan be sequences that do not normally flank the DR3 PLAD in a naturally occurring DR3 receptor. Rand Rcan also be sequences of the DR3 receptor that normally flank the DR3 PLAD in a naturally occurring TNF receptor like receptor wherein the polypeptide comprising the TNF like receptor PLAD is not the entire extracellular domain of a TNF receptor like receptor.

The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can also be blocked using a DR3 Fc fusion protein. Thus provided is a composition comprising a DR3 Fc fusion protein.

A fusion protein comprising or consisting of the DR3 extracellular domain about 140 150 aa fused to a non Fc receptor binding mutant of human IgG1 IgG Fc DR3 human huIg Fusion Protein is provided. The fusion protein can be expressed in eukaryotic cells and purified using protein A for use in vitro and in vivo. Alternatively the cDNA encoding the fusion protein is expressed through hydrodynamic injection into the tail vein of mice. This technique can produce high level expression of the DR3 Fc protein during or after induction of autoimmune disease models. Dagnaes Hansen et al. 2002 Hodges and Scheule 2003 Lecocq et al. 2003 

The nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide comprising or consisting of a DR3 region can also be functionally linked to other nucleic acids to encode an immunoadhesin. For the purposes of the present disclosure the term immunoadhesin is defined as including any polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid where at least a portion of a nucleic acid encoding a non immunoglobulin molecule such as a DR3 extracellular domain is coupled to at least a portion of a nucleic acid encoding an immunoglobulin heavy chain polypeptide IgG for example. The Fc regions of IgG2 IgG3 IgM IgA IgE can also be utilized to construct an immunoadhesin. The coupling may be achieved in a manner which provides for a functional transcribing and translating of the nucleic acid segment and message derived therefrom respectively. These IgG immunoadhesins can be expressed by transient or stable transfection in a variety of mammalian host cells as well as in baculovirus infected cells. Similar to antibodies IgG immunoadhesins can be purified from the culture medium into which they are secreted by single step protein A or protein G affinity chromatography.

The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can be blocked by administration of anti DR3 antibodies. To block the interaction the anti DR3 antibody must be antagonistic. Additionally a DR3 Fc fusion protein can inhibit the interaction between DR3 and TL1A.

The interaction between DR3 and TL1A can be blocked by administration of anti TL1A antibodies. Blocking antibodies against TL1A and DR3 are generated by immunizing mice with the fully glycosylated mammalian extracellular domains of these proteins and specifically screening for blocking activity in a bioassay for TL1A DR3 binding and signal transduction. Thus provided is an anti TL1A antibody that specifically binds surface TL1A and interferes with TL1A induced cell death of an indicator cell line. For example shows the characterization of functional anti TL1A blocking antibodies. These antibodies inhibited TL1A induced apoptosis .

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease can be an autoimmune disease with a T cell component.

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease is asthma. The present data show that DR3 knock out mice are resistant to an animal model of asthma suggesting that blockade of TL1A DR3 interactions would be effective in this model and human asthma.

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease can be multiple sclerosis. There is abundant evidence to support the role of activated T cells in MS extravasation of activated T cells into the brain spinal cord and CSF of MS patients production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL 17 and interferon gamma by T cells in MS and experimental MS animal model lesions. DR3 is expressed on activated T cells and deficiency of DR3 impairs inflammatory cytokine production by activated T cells as shown herein. Therefore blockade of DR3 TL1A interactions is expected to impair T cell cytokine production and ameliorate MS.

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease can be rheumatoid arthritis. Activated T cells can be found in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and agents that block T cell function are efficacious in this disease for example costimulatory T cell blockade by CTLA4. DR3 is expressed on activated T cells and deficiency of DR3 impairs inflammatory cytokine production by activated T cells as shown herein. Therefore blockade of DR3 TL1A interactions is expected to impair T cell cytokine production and ameliorate RA.

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease can be type 1 diabetes. Type I diabetes is caused by activated T cells which infiltrate the pancreas and destroy the islets of langerhans. DR3 is expressed on activated T cells and deficiency of DR3 impairs inflammatory cytokine production by activated T cells. Therefore blockade of DR3 TL1A interactions is expected to impair T cell cytokine production and ameliorate type I diabetes.

In the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease can be graft versus host disease. Allospecific activated T cells which express DR3 secrete cytokines and effector molecules that are critical for graft vs. host disease. Blockade of the TNF family members TL1A Light and FasL through administration of a soluble decoy receptor DcR3 TR6 that binds all three ligands did downmodulate graft vs. host disease in a mouse model Zhang et al. 2001 . Because deficiency of DR3 impairs inflammatory cytokine production by activated T cells blockade of DR3 TL1A interactions by the above disclosed methods is expected to treat or prevent graft vs. host disease.

In some aspects of the disclosed methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune disease the inflammatory or autoimmune disease is inflammatory bowel disease IBD . Thus in some aspects the inflammatory or autoimmune disease of the method is Crohn s disease.

TL1A and DR3 have been found to be expressed in tissue samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and mouse models of IBD Bamias et al. 2003 Bamias et al. 2006 . In addition multiple lines of transgenic mice expressing TL1A constitutively in T cells or dendritic cells develop spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease centered in the duodenum and ileum characterized histologically by destruction of villi bowel wall thickening and inflammatory cell infiltrates. Thus blockade of DR3 TL1A interactions by the above disclosed methods is expected to treat or prevent IBD.

In other aspects the inflammatory or autoimmune disease of the method is not inflammatory bowel disease IBD . Thus in some aspects the inflammatory or autoimmune disease of the method is not Crohn s disease.

Also provided are methods for verifying the efficacy of the compositions and methods for treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Animals can be induced to exhibit relevant characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease and colitis. The animal in which the colitis is produced can be any mammal and can include but is not limited to mouse rat guinea pig hamster rabbit cat dog goat monkey and chimpanzee. The colitis can be produced in the animal by any method known in the art. For example the colitis can be produced by introducing into the colon of the animal an effective amount of a hapten reagent. As an example the hapten reagent can be trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid TNBS or oxazolone 4 ethoxymethylene 2 phenyl 2 oxazolin 5 one .

Th1 mediated colitis can be induced in mice using TNBS. Acute TNBS colitis can be induced in SJL or C57BL10 mice using a single dose of TNBS. Briefly 2.5 mg of TNBS pH 1.5 2.0 Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. in 50 ethanol is administered intrarectally in a total volume of 150 l to lightly anesthetized mice. To establish a chronic model of TNBS colitis Balb c mice are administered weekly dosages of TNBS per rectum in the following manner. Mice are administered 1.5 mg of TNBS delivered in a 50 ethanol vehicle in a total volume of 150 l for weeks 1 2 2.0 mg of TNBS for weeks 3 4 and 2.5 mg of TNBS for weeks 5 6.

Th2 mediated colitis can be induced in mice with oxazolone. Briefly mice are presensitized by painting the skin with 0.2 mL 3 oxazolone in 100 ethanol 5 days after presensitization mice are challenged intra rectally with 150 l 1 oxazolone in 50 ethanol under general anesthesia with isoflurane Baxter Deerfield Ill. .

These models can be used to test the anti DR3 and anti TL1A antibodies and the DR3 Fc fusion protein disclosed herein.

Also provided herein is a method of identifying an agent that can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. The method can comprise providing a sample comprising DR3 and TL1A under conditions that allow the binding of DR3 and TL1A contacting the sample with a candidate agent detecting the level of DR3 TL1A binding comparing the binding level to a control a decrease in DR3 TL1A binding compared to the control identifying an agent that can be used to treat an inflammatory disease.

The binding of DR3 to TL1A can be detected using routine methods such as immunodetection methods that do not disturb protein binding. The methods can be cell based or cell free assays. The steps of various useful immunodetection methods have been described in the scientific literature such as e.g. Maggio et al. Enzyme Immunoassay 1987 and Nakamura et al. Enzyme Immunoassays Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Systems Handbook of Experimental Immunology Vol. 1 Immunochemistry 27.1 27.20 1986 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and specifically for its teaching regarding immunodetection methods. Immunoassays in their most simple and direct sense are binding assays involving binding between antibodies and antigen. Many types and formats of immunoassays are known and all are suitable for detecting the disclosed biomarkers. Examples of immunoassays are enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs radioimmunoassays RIA radioimmune precipitation assays RIPA immunobead capture assays Western blotting dot blotting gel shift assays flow cytometry protein arrays multiplexed bead arrays magnetic capture in vivo imaging fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET and fluorescence recovery localization after photobleaching FRAP FLAP .

The binding of DR3 to TL1A can be detected using fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS . For example disclosed are cell lines transfected with TL1A and DR3 fused to fluorescent proteins. These cell lines can facilitate high throughput screens for biologically expressed and small molecule binding to TL1A and DR3 in their physiological forms.

In general candidate agents can be identified from large libraries of natural products or synthetic or semi synthetic extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure s of the invention. Accordingly virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened using the exemplary methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include but are not limited to plant fungal prokaryotic or animal based extracts fermentation broths and synthetic compounds as well as modifications of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis e.g. semi synthesis or total synthesis of any number of chemical compounds including but not limited to saccharide lipid peptide polypeptide and nucleic acid based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available e.g. from Brandon Associates Merrimack N.H. and Aldrich Chemical Milwaukee Wis. . Alternatively libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial fungal plant and animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources including Biotics Sussex UK Xenova Slough UK Harbor Branch Oceangraphics Institute Ft. Pierce Fla. and PharmaMar U.S.A. Cambridge Mass. . In addition natural and synthetically produced libraries are produced if desired according to methods known in the art e.g. by standard extraction and fractionation methods. Furthermore if desired any library or compound is readily modified using standard chemical physical or biochemical methods. In addition those skilled in the art of drug discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication e.g. taxonomic dereplication biological dereplication and chemical dereplication or any combination thereof or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their effect on the activity of reducing inflammation should be employed whenever possible.

When a crude extract is found to have a desired activity further fractionation of the positive lead extract is necessary to isolate chemical constituents responsible for the observed effect. Thus the goal of the extraction fractionation and purification process is the careful characterization and identification of a chemical entity within the crude extract having an activity that stimulates or inhibits the binding of DR3 and TL1A. The same assays described herein for the detection of activities in mixtures of compounds can be used to purify the active component and to test derivatives thereof. Methods of fractionation and purification of such heterogenous extracts are known in the art. If desired compounds shown to be useful agents for treatment are chemically modified according to methods known in the art. Compounds identified as being of therapeutic value may be subsequently analyzed using animal models for diseases or conditions such as those disclosed herein.

Candidate agents encompass numerous chemical classes but are most often organic molecules e.g. small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2 500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins particularly hydrogen bonding and typically include at least an amine carbonyl hydroxyl or carboxyl group for example at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides saccharides fatty acids steroids purines pyrimidines derivatives structural analogs or combinations thereof. In a further embodiment candidate agents are peptides.

In some embodiments the candidate agents are proteins. In some aspects the candidate agents are naturally occurring proteins or fragments of naturally occurring proteins. Thus for example cellular extracts containing proteins or random or directed digests of proteinaceous cellular extracts can be used. In this way libraries of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins can be made for screening using the methods herein. The libraries can be bacterial fungal viral vertebrate proteins and human proteins.

Administration means a method of administering to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include but are not limited to administration topically parenterally orally intravenously intramuscularly subcutaneously or by aerosol. Administration may be effected continuously or intermittently.

For in vivo administration the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably administered parenterally i.e. intravenously intraperitoneally subcutaneously intrathecally injection to the spinal cord intramuscularly intraarticularly portal vein injection or intratumorally.

The term parenteral as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations may be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use.

In other methods the pharmaceutical preparations may be contacted with the target tissue by direct application of the preparation to the tissue. The application may be made by topical open or closed procedures. By topical it is meant the direct application of the pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment such as the skin nasopharynx external auditory canal eye inhalation to the lung genital mucosa and the like. Open procedures are those procedures which include incising the skin of a patient and directly visualizing the underlying tissue to which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied. This is generally accomplished by a surgical procedure such as a thoracotomy to access the lungs abdominal laparotomy to access abdominal viscera or other direct surgical approach to the target tissue. Closed procedures are invasive procedures in which the internal target tissues are not directly visualized but accessed via inserting instruments through small wounds in the skin. For example the preparations may be administered to the peritoneum by needle lavage. Likewise the pharmaceutical preparations may be administered to the meninges or spinal cord by infusion during a lumbar puncture followed by appropriate positioning of the patient as commonly practiced for spinal anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord. Alternatively the preparations may be administered through endoscopic devices.

Topical administration includes administration to the skin mucosa and surfaces of the lung and eye. Compositions for topical administration including those for inhalation may be prepared as a dry powder which may be pressurized or non pressurized. In non pressurized powder compositions the active ingredient in finely divided form may be used in admixture with a larger sized pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier comprising particles having a size for example of up to 100 micrometers in diameter.

For topical administration to the eye a compound of the invention is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle such that the compound is maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient time period to allow the compound to penetrate the corneal and internal regions of the eye as for example the anterior chamber posterior chamber vitreous body aqueous humor vitreous humor cornea iris cilary lens choroid retina and sclera. The pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle may for example be an ointment vegetable oil or an encapsulating material. Alternatively a compound of the invention may be injected directly into the vitrious and aqueous humor.

Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solids at room temperature but liquids at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Dosage range to have effect on symptoms but to avoid adverse side affects doses will vary with age sex condition extent of disease. When used in the above or other treatments a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the present invention may be employed in pure form or where such forms exist in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and with or without a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder activity of the specific compound employed the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration the route of administration the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidential with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.

The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any counterindications. Dosage can vary and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. For example guidance in selecting appropriate doses for antibodies can be found in the literature on therapeutic uses of antibodies e.g. Handbook of Monoclonal Antibodies Ferrone et al. eds. Noges Publications Park Ridge N.J. 1985 ch. 22 and pp. 303 357 Smith et al. Antibodies in Human Diagnosis and Therapy Haber et al. eds. Raven Press New York 1977 pp. 365 389. Based on experience with other Fc fusion proteins and blocking antibodies against other TNF family members a typical daily dosage of the FcFusion protein used range from about 0.5 to about 10 mg kg of body weight or more per day depending on the factors mentioned above. Monoclonal antibodies are given subcutaneously at about 1 to about 5 mg kg body weight either as an IV infusion or subcutaneously.

For example a typical daily dosage of the disclosed composition used alone might range from about 1 mg kg to up to 100 mg kg of body weight or more per day depending on the factors mentioned above.

Following administration of a disclosed composition for treating inhibiting or preventing an immunopathology the efficacy of the therapeutic can be assessed in various ways well known to the skilled practitioner. For instance one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a composition disclosed herein is efficacious in treating or inhibiting an immunopathologyin a subject by observing that the composition reduces or prevents a further increase in immunopathology. Immunopathologycan be measured by methods that are known in the art.

The compositions that inhibit DR3 and TL1A interactions disclosed herein may be administered prophylactically to patients or subjects who are at risk for immunopathology or who have been newly diagnosed with immunopathology.

The disclosed compositions and methods can also be used for example as tools to isolate and test new drug candidates for a variety of immunopathology related diseases.

The protein may be formulated for the purpose of administration topically orally parenterally intranasally intravenously intramuscularly subcutaneously intraocularly transdermally and the like. Doses of such therapeutic protein agents are well known to those of skill in the art and may be found in pharmaceutical compedia such as the PHYSICIANS DESK REFERENCE Medical Economics Data Publishers REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES Mack Publishing Co. GOODMAN GILMAN THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS McGraw Hill Publ. THE CHEMOTHERAPY SOURCE BOOK Williams and Wilkens Publishers and may alternatively routinely be determined using standard techniques well known to those of skill in the art such as for example are described below at the end of this Section.

Administration of the antibodies can be done as disclosed herein. Nucleic acid approaches for antibody delivery also exist. The broadly blocking anti DR3 or TL1A antibodies and antibody fragments can also be administered to patients or subjects as a nucleic acid preparation e.g. DNA or RNA that encodes the antibody or antibody fragment such that the patient s or subject s own cells take up the nucleic acid and produce and secrete the encoded antibody or antibody fragment.

Antibodies of the invention are preferably administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 19th ed. ed. A. R. Gennaro Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1995. Typically an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include but are not limited to saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8 and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon for instance the route of administration and concentration of antibody being administered.

The antibodies can be administered to the subject patient or cell by injection e.g. intravenous intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular or by other methods such as infusion that ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form. Local or intravenous injection is preferred.

Effective dosages and schedules for administering the antibodies may be determined empirically and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. Those skilled in the art will understand that the dosage of antibodies that must be administered will vary depending on for example the subject that will receive the antibody the route of administration the particular type of antibody used and other drugs being administered. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses for antibodies is found in the literature on therapeutic uses of antibodies e.g. Handbook of Monoclonal Antibodies Ferrone et al. eds. Noges Publications Park Ridge N.J. 1985 ch. 22 and pp. 303 357 Smith et al. Antibodies in Human Diagnosis and Therapy Haber et al. eds. Raven Press New York 1977 pp. 365 389. A typical daily dosage of the antibody used alone might range from about 1 g kg to up to 100 mg kg of body weight or more per day depending on the factors mentioned above.

In the methods described above which include the administration and uptake of exogenous nucleic acids into the cells of a subject i.e. gene transduction or transfection the disclosed nucleic acids can be in the form of naked DNA or RNA or the nucleic acids can be in a vector for delivering the nucleic acids to the cells whereby the antibody encoding DNA fragment is under the transcriptional regulation of a promoter as would be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The vector can be a commercially available preparation such as an adenovirus vector Quantum Biotechnologies Inc. Laval Quebec Canada . Delivery of the nucleic acid or vector to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example delivery can be via a liposome using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN LIPOFECTAMINE GIBCO BRL Inc. Gaithersburg Md. SUPERFECT Qiagen Inc. Hilden Germany and TRANSFECTAM Promega Biotec Inc. Madison Wis. as well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. In addition the disclosed nucleic acid or vector can be delivered in vivo by electroporation the technology for which is available from Genetronics Inc. San Diego Calif. as well as by means of a SONOPORATION machine ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp. Tucson Ariz. .

As one example vector delivery can be via a viral system such as a retroviral vector system which can package a recombinant retroviral genome see e.g. Pastan et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 4486 1988 Miller et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 6 2895 1986 . The recombinant retrovirus can then be used to infect and thereby deliver to the infected cells nucleic acid encoding a blocking antibody or active fragment thereof . The exact method of introducing the altered nucleic acid into mammalian cells is of course not limited to the use of retroviral vectors. Other techniques are widely available for this procedure including the use of adenoviral vectors Mitani et al. Hum. Gene Ther. 5 941 948 1994 adeno associated viral AAV vectors Goodman et al. Blood 84 1492 1500 1994 lentiviral vectors Naidini et al. Science 272 263 267 1996 pseudotyped retroviral vectors Agrawal et al. Exper. Hematol. 24 738 747 1996 . Physical transduction techniques can also be used such as liposome delivery and receptor mediated and other endocytosis mechanisms see for example Schwartzenberger et al. Blood 87 472 478 1996 . The disclosed compositions and methods can be used in conjunction with any of these or other commonly used gene transfer methods.

As one example if the antibody encoding nucleic acid is delivered to the cells of a subject in an adenovirus vector the dosage for administration of adenovirus to humans can range from about 107 to 109 plaque forming units pfu per injection but can be as high as 1012 pfu per injection Crystal Hum. Gene Ther. 8 985 1001 1997 Alvarez and Curiel Hum. Gene Ther. 8 597 613 1997 . A subject can receive a single injection or if additional injections are necessary they can be repeated at six month intervals or other appropriate time intervals as determined by the skilled practitioner for an indefinite period and or until the efficacy of the treatment has been established.

Thus provided is an antibody that has the binding characteristics of an antibody produced by the hybridoma clones designated 1A9 and 106 that bind the human TL1A polypeptide and Hybridoma clones designated 12B12.6 and 5G4.6 that bind the murine TL1A polypeptide.

Binding characteristics of an antibody include its binding specificity. The binding specificity can be specificity for the antigen or it can be specificity based on the epitope recognized by the antibody. Since both the former and the latter are inherent characteristics of an antibody the disclosure of the present antibodies provides definition of both epitope and antigen specificity. Reference to the binding specificity of a deposited monoclonal antibody is the equivalent of reference to the specific epitope on DR3 to which that antibody binds. The binding specificity of any individual monoclonal antibody is an inherent property of any other monoclonal antibody of the sub genus defined by the disclosed deposited antibody. Methods of identifying the binding specificity of a given antibody are well known in the art. Further methods of measuring avidity and other characteristics of antibody binding are well known.

The term antibodies is used herein in a broad sense and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact immunoglobulin molecules also included in the term antibodies are fragments or polymers of those immunoglobulin molecules and human or humanized versions of immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof as long as they are chosen for their ability to interact with DR3 or TL1A such that DR3 is inhibited from interacting with TL1A. Antibodies that bind the disclosed regions involved in the interaction between DR3 and TL1A are also disclosed. The antibodies can be tested for their desired activity using the in vitro assays described herein or by analogous methods after which their in vivo therapeutic and or prophylactic activities are tested according to known clinical testing methods.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies within the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in a small subset of the antibody molecules. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies as long as they exhibit the desired antagonistic activity See U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 .

The disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be made using any procedure which produces monoclonal antibodies. For example disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods such as those described by Kohler and Milstein 256 495 1975 . In a hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.

To give the best chance of producing blocking antibodies the immunizing agents will preferably consist of fully glycosylated native proteins produced by eukaryotic cells. For DR3 the extracellular fragment of the human and mouse receptor expressed as an Fc Fusion protein and cleaved from the Fc portion by a specific protease will be preferably used 

For TL1A the extracellular fragment of the human and mouse TL1A expressed as an epitope tagged fusion protein will be preferably used 

If these approaches do not produce blocking antibodies cells expressing cell surface localized versions of these proteins will be used to immunize mice rats or other species. Traditionally the generation of monoclonal antibodies has depended on the availability of purified protein or peptides for use as the immunogen. More recently DNA based immunizations have shown promise as a way to elicit strong immune responses and generate monoclonal antibodies. In this approach DNA based immunization can be used wherein DNA encoding extracellular fragments of DR3 and TL1A expressed as a fusion protein with human IgG1 or an epitope tag is injected into the host animal according to methods known in the art e.g. Kilpatrick K E et al. Gene gun delivered DNA based immunizations mediate rapid production of murine monoclonal antibodies to the Flt 3 receptor. Hybridoma. 1998 December 17 6 569 76 Kilpatrick K E et al. High affinity monoclonal antibodies to PED PEA 15 generated using 5 microg of DNA. Hybridoma. 2000 August 19 4 297 302 which are incorporated herein by referenced in full for the methods of antibody production and as described in the examples.

An alternate approach to immunizations with either purified protein or DNA is to use antigen expressed in baculovirus. The advantages to this system include ease of generation high levels of expression and post translational modifications that are highly similar to those seen in mammalian systems. Use of this system involves expressing the extracellular domain of TL1A or DR3 as fusion proteins with a signal sequence fragment. The antigen is produced by inserting a gene fragment in frame between the signal sequence and the mature protein domain of the TL1A or DR3 nucleotide sequence. This results in the display of the foreign proteins on the surface of the virion. This method allows immunization with whole virus eliminating the need for purification of target antigens.

Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are used in methods of producing monoclonal antibodies if cells of human origin are desired or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice Academic Press 1986 pp. 59 103 . Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells including myeloma cells of rodent bovine equine and human origin. Usually rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused immortalized cells. For example if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells. Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines which can be obtained for instance from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor J. Immunol. 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 pp. 51 63 . The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against DR3 and or TL1A. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA . Such techniques and assays are known in the art and are described further in the Examples below or in Harlow and Lane Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Publications New York 1988 .

After the desired hybridoma cells are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution or FACS sorting procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium and RPMI 1640 medium. Alternatively the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose protein G hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Cabilly et al. . DNA encoding the disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . Libraries of antibodies or active antibody fragments can also be generated and screened using phage display techniques e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 804 440 to Burton et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 096 441 to Barbas et al.

In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof particularly Fab fragments can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. For instance digestion can be performed using papain. Examples of papain digestion are described in WO 94 29348 published Dec. 22 1994 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 342 566. Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

The fragments whether attached to other sequences or not can also include insertions deletions substitutions or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acids residues provided the activity of the antibody or antibody fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the non modified antibody or antibody fragment. These modifications can provide for some additional property such as to remove add amino acids capable of disulfide bonding to increase its bio longevity to alter its secretory characteristics etc. In any case the antibody or antibody fragment must possess a bioactive property such as specific binding to its cognate antigen. Functional or active regions of the antibody or antibody fragment may be identified by mutagenesis of a specific region of the protein followed by expression and testing of the expressed polypeptide. Such methods are readily apparent to a skilled practitioner in the art and can include site specific mutagenesis of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody or antibody fragment. Zoller M. J. 3 348 354 1992 .

As used herein the term antibody or antibodies can also refer to a human antibody and or a humanized antibody. Many non human antibodies e.g. those derived from mice rats or rabbits are naturally antigenic in humans and thus can give rise to undesirable immune responses when administered to humans. Therefore the use of human or humanized antibodies in the methods serves to lessen the chance that an antibody administered to a human will evoke an undesirable immune response.

As used herein the term antibody encompasses but is not limited to whole immunoglobulin i.e. an intact antibody of any class. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Typically each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V H followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V L and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains. The light chains of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa k and lambda l based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of human immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG 1 IgG 2 IgG 3 and IgG 4 IgA 1 and IgA 2. One skilled in the art would recognize the comparable classes for mouse. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha delta epsilon gamma and mu respectively.

The term variable is used herein to describe certain portions of the variable domains that differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not usually evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a b sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the b sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat E. A. et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The term antibody as used herein is meant to include intact molecules as well as fragments thereof such as for example Fab and F ab which are capable of binding the epitopic determinant.

As used herein the term antibody or fragments thereof encompasses chimeric antibodies and hybrid antibodies with dual or multiple antigen or epitope specificities and fragments such as F ab 2 Fab Fab and the like including hybrid fragments. Thus fragments of the antibodies that retain the ability to bind their specific antigens are provided. For example fragments of antibodies which maintain DR3 or TL1A binding activity are included within the meaning of the term antibody or fragment thereof. Such antibodies and fragments can be made by techniques known in the art and can be screened for specificity and activity according to the methods set forth in the Examples and in general methods for producing antibodies and screening antibodies for specificity and activity See Harlow and Lane. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Publications New York 1988 .

Also included within the meaning of antibody or fragments thereof are conjugates of antibody fragments and antigen binding proteins single chain antibodies as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 704 692 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

An isolated immunogenically specific paratope or fragment of the antibody is also provided. A specific immunogenic epitope of the antibody can be isolated from the whole antibody by chemical or mechanical disruption of the molecule. The purified fragments thus obtained are tested to determine their immunogenicity and specificity by the methods taught herein. Immunoreactive paratopes of the antibody optionally are synthesized directly. An immunoreactive fragment is defined as an amino acid sequence of at least about two to five consecutive amino acids derived from the antibody amino acid sequence.

Alternatively unprotected peptide segments are chemically linked where the bond formed between the peptide segments as a result of the chemical ligation is an unnatural non peptide bond Schnolzer M et al. Science 256 221 1992 . This technique has been used to synthesize analogs of protein domains as well as large amounts of relatively pure proteins with full biological activity deLisle Milton R C et al. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press New York pp. 257 267 1992 .

Also disclosed are fragments of antibodies which have bioactivity. The polypeptide fragments can be recombinant proteins obtained by cloning nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide in an expression system capable of producing the polypeptide fragments thereof such as an adenovirus or baculovirus expression system. For example one can determine the active domain of an antibody from a specific hybridoma that can cause a biological effect associated with the interaction of the antibody with TL1A or DR3. For example amino acids found to not contribute to either the activity or the binding specificity or affinity of the antibody can be deleted without a loss in the respective activity. For example in various embodiments amino or carboxy terminal amino acids are sequentially removed from either the native or the modified non immunoglobulin molecule or the immunoglobulin molecule and the respective activity assayed in one of many available assays. In another example a fragment of an antibody comprises a modified antibody wherein at least one amino acid has been substituted for the naturally occurring amino acid at a specific position and a portion of either amino terminal or carboxy terminal amino acids or even an internal region of the antibody has been replaced with a polypeptide fragment or other moiety such as biotin which can facilitate in the purification of the modified antibody. For example a modified antibody can be fused to a maltose binding protein through either peptide chemistry or cloning the respective nucleic acids encoding the two polypeptide fragments into an expression vector such that the expression of the coding region results in a hybrid polypeptide. The hybrid polypeptide can be affinity purified by passing it over an amylose affinity column and the modified antibody receptor can then be separated from the maltose binding region by cleaving the hybrid polypeptide with the specific protease factor Xa. See for example New England Biolabs Product Catalog 1996 pg. 164. . Similar purification procedures are available for isolating hybrid proteins from eukaryotic cells as well.

The fragments whether attached to other sequences or not include insertions deletions substitutions or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acid residues provided the activity of the fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the non modified antibody or antibody fragment. These modifications can provide for some additional property such as to remove or add amino acids capable of disulfide bonding to increase its bio longevity to alter its secretory characteristics etc. In any case the fragment must possess a bioactive property such as binding activity regulation of binding at the binding domain etc. Functional or active regions of the antibody may be identified by mutagenesis of a specific region of the protein followed by expression and testing of the expressed polypeptide. Such methods are readily apparent to a skilled practitioner in the art and can include site specific mutagenesis of the nucleic acid encoding the antigen. Zoller M J et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 10 6487 500 1982 .

Techniques can also be adapted for the production of single chain antibodies specific to an antigenic protein of the present disclosure see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 . In addition methods can be adapted for the construction of F ab expression libraries see e.g. Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal F ab fragments with the desired specificity for a protein or derivatives fragments analogs or homologs thereof. Antibody fragments that contain the idiotypes to a protein antigen may be produced by techniques known in the art including but not limited to i an F ab 2 fragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule ii an Fab fragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F ab 2 fragment iii an F ab fragment generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent and iv F v fragments.

Methods for the production of single chain antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. The skilled artisan is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 5 359 046 incorporated herein by reference for such methods. A single chain antibody is created by fusing together the variable domains of the heavy and light chains using a short peptide linker thereby reconstituting an antigen binding site on a single molecule. Single chain antibody variable fragments scFvs in which the C terminus of one variable domain is tethered to the N terminus of the other variable domain via a 15 to 25 amino acid peptide or linker have been developed without significantly disrupting antigen binding or specificity of the binding Bedzyk et al. 1990 Chaudhary et al. 1990 . The linker is chosen to permit the heavy chain and light chain to bind together in their proper conformational orientation. See for example Huston J. S. et al. Methods in Enzym. 203 46 121 1991 which is incorporated herein by reference. These Fvs lack the constant regions Fc present in the heavy and light chains of the native antibody.

In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof particularly Fab fragments can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. For instance digestion can be performed using papain. Examples of papain digestion are described in WO 94 29348 published Dec. 22 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 4 342 566 and Harlow and Lane Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Publications New York 1988 . Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a fragment called the F ab 2 fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

The Fab fragments produced in the antibody digestion also contain the constant domains of the light chain and the first constant domain of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. The F ab 2 fragment is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. Antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

In hybrid antibodies one heavy and light chain pair is homologous to that found in an antibody raised against one antigen recognition feature e.g. epitope while the other heavy and light chain pair is homologous to a pair found in an antibody raised against another epitope. This results in the property of multi functional valency i.e. ability to bind at least two different epitopes simultaneously. As used herein the term hybrid antibody refers to an antibody wherein each chain is separately homologous with reference to a mammalian antibody chain but the combination represents a novel assembly so that two different antigens are recognized by the antibody. Such hybrids can be formed by fusion of hybridomas producing the respective component antibodies or by recombinant techniques. Such hybrids may of course also be formed using chimeric chains.

The encoded antibodies can be anti idiotypic antibodies antibodies that bind other antibodies as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 699 880. Such anti idiotypic antibodies could bind endogenous or foreign antibodies in a treated individual thereby to ameliorate or prevent pathological conditions associated with an immune response e.g. in the context of an autoimmune disease.

The targeting function of the antibody can be used therapeutically by coupling the antibody or a fragment thereof with a therapeutic agent. Such coupling of the antibody or fragment e.g. at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc with the therapeutic agent can be achieved by making an immunoconjugate or by making a fusion protein comprising the antibody or antibody fragment and the therapeutic agent. For example provided is a DR3 Fc fusion protein e.g. DR3 extracellular domain 150 aa fused to mouse IgG Fc DR3 human muIg Fusion Protein .

Also included within the meaning of antibody or fragments thereof are conjugates of antibody fragments and antigen binding proteins single chain antibodies as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 704 692 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

An antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include taxol cytochalasin B gramicidin D ethidium bromide emetine mitomycin etoposide tenoposide vincristine vinblastine colchicin doxorubicin daunorubicin dihydroxy anthracin dione mitoxantrone mithramycin actinomycin D 1 dehydrotestosterone glucocorticoids procaine tetracaine lidocaine propranolol and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include but are not limited to antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate 6 mercaptopurine 6 thioguanine cytarabine 5 fluorouracil decarbazine alkylating agents e.g. mechlorethamine thioepa chlorambucil melphalan carmustine BSNU and lomustine CCNU cyclothosphamide busulfan dibromomannitol streptozotocin mitomycin C and cis dichlorodiamine platinum II DDP cisplatin anthracyclines e.g. daunorubicin formerly daunomycin and doxorubicin antibiotics e.g. dactinomycin formerly actinomycin bleomycin mithramycin and anthramycin AMC and anti mitotic agents e.g. vincristine and vinblastine .

The conjugates disclosed can be used for modifying a given biological response. The drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include for example a toxin such as abrin ricin A pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin a protein such as tumor necrosis factor agr interferon bgr interferon nerve growth factor platelet derived growth factor tissue plasminogen activator or biological response modifiers such as for example lymphokines interleukin 1 IL 1 interleukin 2 IL 2 interleukin 6 IL 6 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF or other growth factors.

Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known see e.g. Amon et al. Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy Reisfeld et al. eds. pp. 243 56 Alan R. Liss Inc. 1985 Hellstrom et al. Antibodies For Drug Delivery in Controlled Drug Delivery 2nd Ed. Robinson et al. eds. pp. 623 53 Marcel Dekker Inc. 1987 Thorpe Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications Pinchera et al. eds. pp. 475 506 1985 Analysis Results And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy Baldwin et al. eds. pp. 303 16 Academic Press 1985 and Thorpe et al. The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of Antibody Toxin Conjugates Immunol. Rev. 62 119 58 1982 . Alternatively an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

One method of producing proteins comprising the antibodies is to link two or more peptides or polypeptides together by protein chemistry techniques. For example peptides or polypeptides can be chemically synthesized using currently available laboratory equipment using either Fmoc 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl or Boc tert butyloxycarbonoyl chemistry. Applied Biosystems Inc. Foster City Calif. . One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that a peptide or polypeptide corresponding to the antibody for example can be synthesized by standard chemical reactions. For example a peptide or polypeptide can be synthesized and not cleaved from its synthesis resin whereas the other fragment of an antibody can be synthesized and subsequently cleaved from the resin thereby exposing a terminal group which is functionally blocked on the other fragment. By peptide condensation reactions these two fragments can be covalently joined via a peptide bond at their carboxyl and amino termini respectively to form an antibody or fragment thereof. Grant G A 1992 Synthetic Peptides A User Guide. W.H. Freeman and Co. N.Y. 1992 Bodansky M and Trost B. Ed. 1993 Principles of Peptide Synthesis. Springer Verlag Inc. NY. Alternatively the peptide or polypeptide is independently synthesized in vivo as described above. Once isolated these independent peptides or polypeptides may be linked to form an antibody or fragment thereof via similar peptide condensation reactions.

For example enzymatic ligation of cloned or synthetic peptide segments allow relatively short peptide fragments to be joined to produce larger peptide fragments polypeptides or whole protein domains Abrahmsen L et al. Biochemistry 30 4151 1991 . Alternatively native chemical ligation of synthetic peptides can be utilized to synthetically construct large peptides or polypeptides from shorter peptide fragments. This method consists of a two step chemical reaction Dawson et al. Synthesis of Proteins by Native Chemical Ligation. Science 266 776 779 1994 . The first step is the chemoselective reaction of an unprotected synthetic peptide alpha thioester with another unprotected peptide segment containing an amino terminal Cys residue to give a thioester linked intermediate as the initial covalent product. Without a change in the reaction conditions this intermediate undergoes spontaneous rapid intramolecular reaction to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site. Application of this native chemical ligation method to the total synthesis of a protein molecule is illustrated by the preparation of human interleukin 8 IL 8 Baggiolini M et al. 1992 FEBS Lett. 307 97 101 Clark Lewis I et al. J. Biol. Chem. 269 16075 1994 Clark Lewis I et al. Biochemistry 30 3128 1991 Rajarathnam K et al. Biochemistry 33 6623 30 1994 .

Transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be employed. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J H gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge see e.g. Jakobovits et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 2551 255 1993 Jakobovits et al. Nature 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. Year in Immuno. 7 33 1993 . Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries Hoogenboom et al. J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 1991 Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 1991 . The techniques of Cote et al. and Boerner et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. J. Immunol. 147 1 86 95 1991 .

Optionally the antibodies are generated in other species and humanized for administration in humans. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab 2 or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementarity determining region CDR of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 327 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Antibody humanization techniques generally involve the use of recombinant DNA technology to manipulate the DNA sequence encoding one or more polypeptide chains of an antibody molecule. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly a humanized form of a non human antibody or a fragment thereof is a chimeric antibody or fragment U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted with the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted with residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important in order to reduce antigenicity. According to the best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework FR for the humanized antibody Sims et al. J. Immunol. 151 2296 1993 and Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. J. Immunol. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequence so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding see WO 94 04679 published 3 Mar. 1994 .

Disclosed are antigen binding polypeptide molecules that bind specifically to the TNF family cytokine TL1A. The polypeptides include a humanized heavy chain variable region and a humanized light chain variable region. For example the polypeptides may include the framework FR regions of the light and heavy chain variable regions of a human antibody while retaining substantially the antigen binding specificity of a parental monoclonal antibody. The humanized heavy chain variable region and or the humanized light chain variable region are at least about 87 humanized at least about 90 humanized at least about 95 humanized at least about 98 humanized or at least about 100 humanized excluding the complementary determining regions CDRs . The antigen binding polypeptide molecules may be derived from monoclonal antibody donors e.g. mouse monoclonal antibody donors human monoclonal antibody donors and may include CDRs from the monoclonal antibodies e.g. mouse monoclonal CDRs human monoclonal CDRs . The polypeptides may function as antagonists for the cytokine TL1A.

As used herein the term epitope is meant to include any determinant capable of specific interaction with the anti DR3 or anti TL1A antibodies disclosed. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics.

An epitope tag denotes a short peptide sequence unrelated to the function of the antibody or molecule that can be used for purification or crosslinking of the molecule with anti epitope tag antibodies or other reagents.

By specifically binds is meant that an antibody recognizes and physically interacts with its cognate antigen e.g. a DR3 receptor polypeptide or a TL1A polypeptide and does not significantly recognize and interact with other antigens such an antibody may be a polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody which are generated by techniques that are well known in the art.

The antibody can be bound to a substrate or labeled with a detectable moiety or both bound and labeled. The detectable moieties contemplated with the present compositions include fluorescent enzymatic and radioactive markers.

There are a variety of sequences related to the protein molecules involved in the signaling pathways disclosed herein for example DR3 and TL1A all of which are encoded by nucleic acids or are nucleic acids.

A nucleotide is a molecule that contains a base moiety a sugar moiety and a phosphate moiety. Nucleotides can be linked together through their phosphate moieties and sugar moieties creating an internucleoside linkage. The base moiety of a nucleotide can be adenin 9 yl A cytosin 1 yl C guanin 9 yl G uracil 1 yl U and thymin 1 yl T . The sugar moiety of a nucleotide is a ribose or a deoxyribose. The phosphate moiety of a nucleotide is pentavalent phosphate. A non limiting example of a nucleotide would be 3 AMP 3 adenosine monophosphate or 5 GMP 5 guanosine monophosphate . There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein. The term nucleotide includes nucleotides and nucleotide analogs preferably groups of nucleotides comprising oligonucleotides and refers to any compound containing a heterocyclic compound bound to a phosphorylated sugar by an N glycosyl link or any monomer capable of complementary base pairing or any polymer capable of hybridizing to an oligonucleotide.

The term nucleotide analog refers to molecules that can be used in place of naturally occurring bases in nucleic acid synthesis and processing preferably enzymatic as well as chemical synthesis and processing particularly modified nucleotides capable of base pairing. A nucleotide analog is a nucleotide which contains some type of modification to one of the base sugar or phosphate moieties. Modifications to nucleotides are well known in the art and would include for example 5 methylcytosine 5 me C 5 hydroxymethyl cytosine xanthine hypoxanthine and 2 aminoadenine as well as modifications at the sugar or phosphate moieties.

This term includes but is not limited to modified purines and pyrimidines minor bases convertible nucleosides structural analogs of purines and pyrimidines labeled derivatized and modified nucleosides and nucleotides conjugated nucleosides and nucleotides sequence modifiers terminus modifiers spacer modifiers and nucleotides with backbone modifications including but not limited to ribose modified nucleotides phosphoramidates phosphorothioates phosphonamidites methyl phosphonates methyl phosphoramidites methyl phosphonamidites 5 cyanoethyl phosphoramidites methylenephosphonates phosphorodithioates peptide nucleic acids achiral and neutral internucleotidic linkages and normucleotide bridges such as polyethylene glycol aromatic polyamides and lipids. Optionally a nucleotide analog is a synthetic base that does not comprise adenine guanine cytosine thymidine uracil or minor bases. These and other nucleotide and nucleoside derivatives analogs and backbone modifications are known in the art e.g. Piccirilli J. A. et al. 1990 Nature 343 33 37 Sanghvi et al 1993 In Nucleosides and Nucleotides as Antitumor and Antiviral Agents Eds. C. K. Chu and D. C. Baker Plenum New York pp. 311 323 Goodchild J. 1990 Bioconjugate Chemistry 1 165 187 Beaucage et al. 1993 Tetrahedron 49 1925 1963 . Nucleotide substitutes are molecules having similar functional properties to nucleotides but which do not contain a phosphate moiety such as peptide nucleic acid PNA . Nucleotide substitutes are molecules that will recognize nucleic acids in a Watson Crick or Hoogsteen manner but which are linked together through a moiety other than a phosphate moiety. Nucleotide substitutes are able to conform to a double helix type structure when interacting with the appropriate target nucleic acid. There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.

It is also possible to link other types of molecules conjugates to nucleotides or nucleotide analogs to enhance for example cellular uptake. Conjugates can be chemically linked to the nucleotide or nucleotide analogs. Such conjugates include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety. Letsinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1989 86 6553 6556 . There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.

There are a variety of molecules disclosed herein that are nucleic acid based including for example the nucleic acids that encode for example TL1A and DR3 as well as any other proteins disclosed herein as well as various functional nucleic acids. The disclosed nucleic acids are made up of for example nucleotides nucleotide analogs or nucleotide substitutes. Non limiting examples of these and other molecules are discussed herein. It is understood that for example when a vector is expressed in a cell the expressed mRNA will typically be made up of A C G and U. Likewise it is understood that if for example an antisense molecule is introduced into a cell or cell environment through for example exogenous delivery it is advantageous that the antisense molecule be made up of nucleotide analogs that reduce the degradation of the antisense molecule in the cellular environment.

By isolated nucleic acid or purified nucleic acid is meant DNA that is free of the genes that in the naturally occurring genome of the organism from which the DNA of the invention is derived flank the gene. The term therefore includes for example a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector such as an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus or incorporated into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote e.g. a transgene or which exists as a separate molecule e.g. a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR restriction endonuclease digestion or chemical or in vitro synthesis . It also includes a recombinant DNA which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence. The term isolated nucleic acid also refers to RNA e.g. an mRNA molecule that is encoded by an isolated DNA molecule or that is chemically synthesized or that is separated or substantially free from at least some cellular components e.g. other types of RNA molecules or polypeptide molecules.

A Watson Crick interaction is at least one interaction with the Watson Crick face of a nucleotide nucleotide analog or nucleotide substitute. The Watson Crick face of a nucleotide nucleotide analog or nucleotide substitute includes the C2 N1 and C6 positions of a purine based nucleotide nucleotide analog or nucleotide substitute and the C2 N3 C4 positions of a pyrimidine based nucleotide nucleotide analog or nucleotide substitute.

A Hoogsteen interaction is the interaction that takes place on the Hoogsteen face of a nucleotide or nucleotide analog which is exposed in the major groove of duplex DNA. The Hoogsteen face includes the N7 position and reactive groups NHor O at the C6 position of purine nucleotides.

The term oligonucleotide means a naturally occurring or synthetic polymer of nucleotides preferably a polymer comprising at least three nucleotides and more preferably a polymer capable of hybridization. Oligonucleotides may be single stranded double stranded partially single stranded or partially double stranded ribonucleic or deoxyribonucleic acids including selected nucleic acid sequences heteroduplexes chimeric and hybridized nucleotides and oligonucleotides conjugated to one or more non oligonucleotide molecules.

The term polynucleotide is used broadly herein to mean a sequence of two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides that are linked together by a phosphodiester bond. As such the term polynucleotide includes RNA and DNA which can be a gene or a portion thereof a cDNA a synthetic polydeoxyribonucleic acid sequence or the like and can be single stranded or double stranded as well as a DNA RNA hybrid. Furthermore the term polynucleotide as used herein includes naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules which can be isolated from a cell as well as synthetic molecules which can be prepared for example by methods of chemical synthesis or by enzymatic methods such as by the polymerase chain reaction PCR . In various embodiments a polynucleotide of the invention can contain nucleoside or nucleotide analogs or a backbone bond other than a phosphodiester bond. In general the nucleotides comprising a polynucleotide are naturally occurring deoxyribonucleotides such as adenine cytosine guanine or thymine linked to 2 deoxyribose or ribonucleotides such as adenine cytosine guanine or uracil linked to ribose. However a polynucleotide also can contain nucleotide analogs including non naturally occurring synthetic nucleotides or modified naturally occurring nucleotides. Such nucleotide analogs are well known in the art and commercially available as are polynucleotides containing such nucleotide analogs Lin et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 22 5220 5234 1994 Jellinek et al. Biochemistry 34 11363 11372 1995 Pagratis et al. Nature Biotechnol. 15 68 73 1997 each of which is incorporated herein by reference .

The covalent bond linking the nucleotides of a polynucleotide generally is a phosphodiester bond. However the covalent bond also can be any of numerous other bonds including a thiodiester bond a phosphorothioate bond a peptide like bond or any other bond known to those in the art as useful for linking nucleotides to produce synthetic polynucleotides see for example Tam et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 22 977 986 1994 Ecker and Crooke BioTechnology 13 351360 1995 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . The incorporation of non naturally occurring nucleotide analogs or bonds linking the nucleotides or analogs can be particularly useful where the polynucleotide is to be exposed to an environment that can contain a nucleolytic activity including for example a tissue culture medium or upon administration to a living subject since the modified polynucleotides can be less susceptible to degradation.

Functional analogs of naturally occurring polynucleotides can bind to RNA or DNA and include peptide nucleic acid PNA molecules.

A fragment of a reference nucleic acid contains only contiguous nucleic acids of the reference nucleic acid and is at least one nucleotide shorter than the reference sequence.

Disclosed are compositions including primers and probes which are capable of interacting with the disclosed nucleic acids such as the DR3 or TL1A as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments the primers are used to support DNA amplification reactions. Typically the primers will be capable of being extended in a sequence specific manner. Extension of a primer in a sequence specific manner includes any methods wherein the sequence and or composition of the nucleic acid molecule to which the primer is hybridized or otherwise associated directs or influences the composition or sequence of the product produced by the extension of the primer. Extension of the primer in a sequence specific manner therefore includes but is not limited to PCR DNA sequencing DNA extension DNA polymerization RNA transcription or reverse transcription. Techniques and conditions that amplify the primer in a sequence specific manner are preferred. In certain embodiments the primers are used for the DNA amplification reactions such as PCR or direct sequencing. It is understood that in certain embodiments the primers can also be extended using non enzymatic techniques where for example the nucleotides or oligonucleotides used to extend the primer are modified such that they will chemically react to extend the primer in a sequence specific manner. Typically the disclosed primers hybridize with the disclosed nucleic acids or region of the nucleic acids or they hybridize with the complement of the nucleic acids or complement of a region of the nucleic acids.

The size of the primers or probes for interaction with the nucleic acids in certain embodiments can be any size that supports the desired enzymatic manipulation of the primer such as DNA amplification or the simple hybridization of the probe or primer. A typical primer or probe would be at least 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750 3000 3500 or 4000 nucleotides long.

In other embodiments a primer or probe can be less than or equal to 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750 3000 3500 or 4000 nucleotides long.

The primers for the DR3 or TL1A gene typically will be used to produce an amplified DNA product that contains a region of the DR3 or TL1A gene or the complete gene. Typically the size of the product will be such that the size can be accurately determined to within 3 2 or 1 nucleotides.

In certain embodiments this product is at least 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750 3000 3500 or 4000 nucleotides long.

In other embodiments the product is less than or equal to 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500 2750 3000 3500 or 4000 nucleotides long.

As discussed herein there are numerous variants of the DR3 protein and TL1A protein that are known and herein contemplated. In addition to the known functional strain variants there are derivatives of the DR3 or TL1A proteins which also function in the disclosed methods and compositions. Protein variants and derivatives are well understood to those of skill in the art and can involve amino acid sequence modifications. For example amino acid sequence modifications typically fall into one or more of three classes substitutional insertional or deletional variants. Insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Insertions ordinarily will be smaller insertions than those of amino or carboxyl terminal fusions for example on the order of one to four residues. Immunogenic fusion protein derivatives such as those described in the examples are made by fusing a polypeptide sufficiently large to confer immunogenicity to the target sequence by cross linking in vitro or by recombinant cell culture transformed with DNA encoding the fusion. Deletions are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the protein sequence. Typically no more than about from 2 to 6 residues are deleted at any one site within the protein molecule. These variants ordinarily are prepared by site specific mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the protein thereby producing DNA encoding the variant and thereafter expressing the DNA in recombinant cell culture. Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known for example M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues but can occur at a number of different locations at once insertions usually will be on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues and deletions will range about from 1 to 30 residues. Deletions or insertions preferably are made in adjacent pairs i.e. a deletion of 2 residues or insertion of 2 residues. Substitutions deletions insertions or any combination thereof may be combined to arrive at a final construct. The mutations must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure. Substitutional variants are those in which at least one residue has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Such substitutions generally are made in accordance with the following Tables 1 and 2 and are referred to as conservative substitutions.

Substantial changes in function or immunological identity are made by selecting substitutions that are less conservative than those in Table 3 i.e. selecting residues that differ more significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in the protein properties will be those in which a a hydrophilic residue e.g. seryl or threonyl is substituted for or by a hydrophobic residue e.g. leucyl isoleucyl phenylalanyl valyl or alanyl b a cysteine or proline is substituted for or by any other residue c a residue having an electropositive side chain e.g. lysyl arginyl or histidyl is substituted for or by an electronegative residue e.g. glutamyl or aspartyl d a residue having a bulky side chain e.g. phenylalanine is substituted for or by one not having a side chain e.g. glycine in this case or e by increasing the number of sites for sulfation and or glycosylation.

For example the replacement of one amino acid residue with another that is biologically and or chemically similar is known to those skilled in the art as a conservative substitution. For example a conservative substitution would be replacing one hydrophobic residue for another or one polar residue for another. The substitutions include combinations such as for example Gly Ala Val Ile Leu Asp Glu Asn Gln Ser Thr Lys Arg and Phe Tyr. Such conservatively substituted variations of each explicitly disclosed sequence are included within the mosaic polypeptides provided herein.

Substitutional or deletional mutagenesis can be employed to insert sites for N glycosylation Asn X Thr Ser or O glycosylation Ser or Thr . Deletions of cysteine or other labile residues also may be desirable. Deletions or substitutions of potential proteolysis sites e.g. Arg are accomplished for example by deleting one of the basic residues or substituting one by glutaminyl or histidyl residues.

Certain post translational derivatizations are the result of the action of recombinant host cells on the expressed polypeptide. Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently post translationally deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and asparyl residues. Alternatively these residues are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Other post translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the o amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton Proteins Structure and Molecular Properties W. H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and in some instances amidation of the C terminal carboxyl.

It is understood that one way to define the variants and derivatives of the disclosed proteins herein is through defining the variants and derivatives in terms of homology identity to specific known sequences. For example SEQ ID NO 2 sets forth a particular sequence of DR3 and SEQ ID NO 4 sets forth a particular sequence of TL1A protein. Specifically disclosed are variants of these and other proteins herein disclosed which have at least 70 or 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 or 95 homology to the stated sequence. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the homology of two proteins. For example the homology can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the homology is at its highest level.

Another way of calculating homology can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by inspection.

The same types of homology can be obtained for nucleic acids by for example the algorithms disclosed in Zuker M. 244 48 52 1989 Jaeger et al. 86 7706 7710 1989 Jaeger et al. 183 281 306 1989 which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment.

It is understood that the description of conservative mutations and homology can be combined together in any combination such as embodiments that have at least 70 homology to a particular sequence wherein the variants are conservative mutations.

As this specification discusses various proteins and protein sequences it is understood that the nucleic acids that can encode those protein sequences are also disclosed. This would include all degenerate sequences related to a specific protein sequence i.e. all nucleic acids having a sequence that encodes one particular protein sequence as well as all nucleic acids including degenerate nucleic acids encoding the disclosed variants and derivatives of the protein sequences. Thus while each particular nucleic acid sequence may not be written out herein it is understood that each and every sequence is in fact disclosed and described herein through the disclosed protein sequence. It is also understood that while no amino acid sequence indicates what particular DNA sequence encodes that protein within an organism where particular variants of a disclosed protein are disclosed herein the known nucleic acid sequence that encodes that protein is also known and herein disclosed and described.

It is understood that there are numerous amino acid and peptide analogs which can be incorporated into the disclosed compositions. For example there are numerous D amino acids or amino acids which have a different functional substituent than the amino acids shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The opposite stereoisomers of naturally occurring peptides are disclosed as well as the stereoisomers of peptide analogs. These amino acids can readily be incorporated into polypeptide chains by charging tRNA molecules with the amino acid of choice and engineering genetic constructs that utilize for example amber codons to insert the analog amino acid into a peptide chain in a site specific way Thorson et al.

Molecules can be produced that resemble peptides but which are not connected via a natural peptide linkage. For example linkages for amino acids or amino acid analogs can include CHNH CHS CH CH CH CH cis and trans COCH CH OH CH and CHHSO these and others can be found in Spatola A.

It is understood that peptide analogs can have more than one atom between the bond atoms such as b alanine g aminobutyric acid and the like.

Amino acid analogs and analogs and peptide analogs often have enhanced or desirable properties such as more economical production greater chemical stability enhanced pharmacological properties half life absorption potency efficacy etc. altered specificity e.g. a broad spectrum of biological activities reduced antigenicity and others.

D amino acids can be used to generate more stable peptides because D amino acids are not recognized by peptidases and such. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D amino acid of the same type e.g. D lysine in place of L lysine can be used to generate more stable peptides. Cysteine residues can be used to cyclize or attach two or more peptides together. This can be beneficial to constrain peptides into particular conformations. Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61 387 1992 incorporated herein by reference .

It is understood that as discussed herein the use of the terms homology and identity mean the same thing as similarity. Thus for example if the use of the word homology is used between two non natural sequences it is understood that this is not necessarily indicating an evolutionary relationship between these two sequences but rather is looking at the similarity or relatedness between their nucleic acid sequences. Many of the methods for determining homology between two evolutionarily related molecules are routinely applied to any two or more nucleic acids or proteins for the purpose of measuring sequence similarity regardless of whether they are evolutionarily related or not.

In general it is understood that one way to define any known variants and derivatives or those that might arise of the disclosed genes and proteins herein is through defining the variants and derivatives in terms of homology to specific known sequences. This identity of particular sequences disclosed herein is also discussed elsewhere herein. In general variants of genes and proteins herein disclosed typically have at least about 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 percent homology to the stated sequence or the native sequence. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the homology of two proteins or nucleic acids such as genes. For example the homology can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the homology is at its highest level.

Another way of calculating homology can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by inspection.

The same types of homology can be obtained for nucleic acids by for example the algorithms disclosed in Zuker M. 244 48 52 1989 Jaeger et al. 86 7706 7710 1989 Jaeger et al. 183 281 306 1989 which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment. It is understood that any of the methods typically can be used and that in certain instances the results of these various methods may differ but the skilled artisan understands if identity is found with at least one of these methods the sequences would be said to have the stated identity and be disclosed herein.

For example as used herein a sequence recited as having a particular percent homology to another sequence refers to sequences that have the recited homology as calculated by any one or more of the calculation methods described above. For example a first sequence has 80 percent homology as defined herein to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using the Zuker calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80 percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by any of the other calculation methods. As another example a first sequence has 80 percent homology as defined herein to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using both the Zuker calculation method and the Pearson and Lipman calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80 percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by the Smith and Waterman calculation method the Needleman and Wunsch calculation method the Jaeger calculation methods or any of the other calculation methods. As yet another example a first sequence has 80 percent homology as defined herein to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using each of calculation methods although in practice the different calculation methods will often result in different calculated homology percentages .

The term hybridization typically means a sequence driven interaction between at least two nucleic acid molecules such as a primer or a probe and a gene. Sequence driven interaction means an interaction that occurs between two nucleotides or nucleotide analogs or nucleotide derivatives in a nucleotide specific manner. For example G interacting with C or A interacting with T are sequence driven interactions. Typically sequence driven interactions occur on the Watson Crick face or Hoogsteen face of the nucleotide. The hybridization of two nucleic acids is affected by a number of conditions and parameters known to those of skill in the art. For example the salt concentrations pH and temperature of the reaction all affect whether two nucleic acid molecules will hybridize.

Parameters for selective hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules are well known to those of skill in the art. For example in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions can be defined as stringent hybridization conditions. For example stringency of hybridization is controlled by both temperature and salt concentration of either or both of the hybridization and washing steps. For example the conditions of hybridization to achieve selective hybridization may involve hybridization in high ionic strength solution 6 SSC or 6 SSPE at a temperature that is about 12 25 C. below the Tm the melting temperature at which half of the molecules dissociate from their hybridization partners followed by washing at a combination of temperature and salt concentration chosen so that the washing temperature is about 5 C. to 20 C. below the Tm. The temperature and salt conditions are readily determined empirically in preliminary experiments in which samples of reference DNA immobilized on filters are hybridized to a labeled nucleic acid of interest and then washed under conditions of different stringencies. Hybridization temperatures are typically higher for DNA RNA and RNA RNA hybridizations. The conditions can be used as described above to achieve stringency or as is known in the art. Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 Kunkel et al. Methods Enzymol. 1987 154 367 1987 which is herein incorporated by reference for material at least related to hybridization of nucleic acids . A preferable stringent hybridization condition for a DNA DNA hybridization can be at about 68 C. in aqueous solution in 6 SSC or 6 SSPE followed by washing at 68 C. Stringency of hybridization and washing if desired can be reduced accordingly as the degree of complementarity desired is decreased and further depending upon the G C or A T richness of any area wherein variability is searched for. Likewise stringency of hybridization and washing if desired can be increased accordingly as homology desired is increased and further depending upon the G C or A T richness of any area wherein high homology is desired all as known in the art.

Another way to define selective hybridization is by looking at the amount percentage of one of the nucleic acids bound to the other nucleic acid. For example in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about 60 65 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 percent of the limiting nucleic acid is bound to the non limiting nucleic acid. Typically the non limiting primer is in for example 10 or 100 or 1000 fold excess. This type of assay can be performed under conditions where both the limiting and non limiting primer are for example 10 fold or 100 fold or 1000 fold below their k or where only one of the nucleic acid molecules is 10 fold or 100 fold or 1000 fold or where one or both nucleic acid molecules are above their k.

Another way to define selective hybridization is by looking at the percentage of primer that gets enzymatically manipulated under conditions where hybridization is required to promote the desired enzymatic manipulation. For example in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about 60 65 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 percent of the primer is enzymatically manipulated under conditions which promote the enzymatic manipulation for example if the enzymatic manipulation is DNA extension then selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about 60 65 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 percent of the primer molecules are extended. Preferred conditions also include those suggested by the manufacturer or indicated in the art as being appropriate for the enzyme performing the manipulation.

Just as with homology it is understood that there are a variety of methods herein disclosed for determining the level of hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules. It is understood that these methods and conditions may provide different percentages of hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules but unless otherwise indicated meeting the parameters of any of the methods would be sufficient. For example if 80 hybridization was required and as long as hybridization occurs within the required parameters in any one of these methods it is considered disclosed herein.

It is understood that those of skill in the art understand that if a composition or method meets any one of these criteria for determining hybridization either collectively or singly it is a composition or method that is disclosed herein.

There are a number of compositions and methods which can be used to deliver nucleic acids to cells either in vitro or in vivo. These methods and compositions can largely be broken down into two classes viral based delivery systems and non viral based delivery systems. For example the nucleic acids can be delivered through a number of direct delivery systems such as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate precipitation plasmids viral vectors viral nucleic acids phage nucleic acids phages cosmids or via transfer of genetic material in cells or carriers such as cationic liposomes. Appropriate means for transfection including viral vectors chemical transfectants or physico mechanical methods such as electroporation and direct diffusion of DNA are described by for example Wolff J. A. et al. Science 247 1465 1468 1990 and Wolff J. A. Nature 352 815 818 1991 . Such methods are well known in the art and readily adaptable for use with the compositions and methods described herein. In certain cases the methods will be modified to specifically function with large DNA molecules. Further these methods can be used to target certain diseases and cell populations by using the targeting characteristics of the carrier.

Transfer vectors can be any nucleotide construction used to deliver genes into cells e.g. a plasmid or as part of a general strategy to deliver genes e.g. as part of recombinant retrovirus or adenovirus Ram et al. Cancer Res. 53 83 88 1993 .

As used herein plasmid or viral vectors are agents that transport the disclosed nucleic acids such as DR3 or TL1A into the cell without degradation and include a promoter yielding expression of the gene in the cells into which it is delivered. In some embodiments the vectors are derived from either a virus or a retrovirus. Viral vectors are for example Adenovirus Adeno associated virus Herpes virus Vaccinia virus Polio virus AIDS virus neuronal trophic virus Sindbis and other RNA viruses including these viruses with the HIV backbone. Also preferred are any viral families which share the properties of these viruses which make them suitable for use as vectors. Retroviruses include Murine Maloney Leukemia virus MMLV and retroviruses that express the desirable properties of MMLV as a vector. Retroviral vectors are able to carry a larger genetic payload i.e. a transgene or marker gene than other viral vectors and for this reason are a commonly used vector. However they are not as useful in non proliferating cells. Adenovirus vectors are relatively stable and easy to work with have high titers can be delivered in aerosol formulation and can transfect non dividing cells. Pox viral vectors are large and have several sites for inserting genes they are thermostable and can be stored at room temperature. A preferred embodiment is a viral vector which has been engineered so as to suppress the immune response of the host organism elicited by the viral antigens. Preferred vectors of this type will carry coding regions for Interleukin 8 or 10.

Viral vectors can have higher transaction ability to introduce genes abilities than chemical or physical methods to introduce genes into cells. Typically viral vectors contain non structural early genes structural late genes an RNA polymerase III transcript inverted terminal repeats necessary for replication and encapsidation and promoters to control the transcription and replication of the viral genome. When engineered as vectors viruses typically have one or more of the early genes removed and a gene or gene promotor cassette is inserted into the viral genome in place of the removed viral DNA. Constructs of this type can carry up to about 8 kb of foreign genetic material. The necessary functions of the removed early genes are typically supplied by cell lines which have been engineered to express the gene products of the early genes in trans.

A retrovirus is an animal virus belonging to the virus family of Retroviridae including any types subfamilies genus or tropisms. Retroviral vectors in general are described by Verma I. M. Retroviral vectors for gene transfer. In Microbiology 1985 American Society for Microbiology pp. 229 232 Washington 1985 which is incorporated by reference herein. Examples of methods for using retroviral vectors for gene therapy are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 868 116 and 4 980 286 PCT applications WO 90 02806 and WO 89 07136 and Mulligan Science 260 926 932 1993 the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.

A retrovirus is essentially a package which has packed into it nucleic acid cargo. The nucleic acid cargo carries with it a packaging signal which ensures that the replicated daughter molecules will be efficiently packaged within the package coat. In addition to the package signal there are a number of molecules which are needed in cis for the replication and packaging of the replicated virus. Typically a retroviral genome contains the gag pol and env genes which are involved in the making of the protein coat. It is the gag pol and env genes which are typically replaced by the foreign DNA that it is to be transferred to the target cell. Retrovirus vectors typically contain a packaging signal for incorporation into the package coat a sequence which signals the start of the gag transcription unit elements necessary for reverse transcription including a primer binding site to bind the tRNA primer of reverse transcription terminal repeat sequences that guide the switch of RNA strands during DNA synthesis a purine rich sequence 5 to the 3 LTR that serves as the priming site for the synthesis of the second strand of DNA synthesis and specific sequences near the ends of the LTRs that enable the insertion of the DNA state of the retrovirus to insert into the host genome. The removal of the gag pol and env genes allows for about 8 kb of foreign sequence to be inserted into the viral genome become reverse transcribed and upon replication be packaged into a new retroviral particle. This amount of nucleic acid is sufficient for the delivery of one to many genes depending on the size of each transcript. It is preferable to include either positive or negative selectable markers along with other genes in the insert.

Since the replication machinery and packaging proteins in most retroviral vectors have been removed gag pol and env the vectors are typically generated by placing them into a packaging cell line. A packaging cell line is a cell line which has been transfected or transformed with a retrovirus that contains the replication and packaging machinery but lacks any packaging signal. When the vector carrying the DNA of choice is transfected into these cell lines the vector containing the gene of interest is replicated and packaged into new retroviral particles by the machinery provided in cis by the helper cell. The genomes for the machinery are not packaged because they lack the necessary signals.

The construction of replication defective adenoviruses has been described Berkner et al. J. Virology 61 1213 1220 1987 Massie et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 6 2872 2883 1986 Haj Ahmad et al. J.

Virology 61 1226 1239 1987 Zhang Generation and identification of recombinant adenovirus by liposome mediated transfection and PCR analysis BioTechniques 15 868 872 1993 . The benefit of the use of these viruses as vectors is that they are limited in the extent to which they can spread to other cell types since they can replicate within an initial infected cell but are unable to form new infectious viral particles. Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to achieve high efficiency gene transfer after direct in vivo delivery to airway epithelium hepatocytes vascular endothelium CNS parenchyma and a number of other tissue sites Morsy J.

Recombinant adenoviruses achieve gene transduction by binding to specific cell surface receptors after which the virus is internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis in the same manner as wild type or replication defective adenovirus Chardonnet and Dales Virology 40 462 477 1970 Brown and Burlingham J.

A viral vector can be one based on an adenovirus which has had the E1 gene removed and these virons are generated in a cell line such as the human 293 cell line. In another preferred embodiment both the E1 and E3 genes are removed from the adenovirus genome.

Another type of viral vector is based on an adeno associated virus AAV . This defective parvovirus is a preferred vector because it can infect many cell types and is non pathogenic to humans. AAV type vectors can transport about 4 to 5 kb and wild type AAV is known to stably insert into chromosome 19. Vectors which contain this site specific integration property are preferred. An especially preferred embodiment of this type of vector is the P4.1 C vector produced by Avigen San Francisco Calif. which can contain the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene HSV tk and or a marker gene such as the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein GFP.

In another type of AAV virus the AAV contains a pair of inverted terminal repeats ITRs which flank at least one cassette containing a promoter which directs cell specific expression operably linked to a heterologous gene. Heterologous in this context refers to any nucleotide sequence or gene which is not native to the AAV or B19 parvovirus.

Typically the AAV and B19 coding regions have been deleted resulting in a safe non cytotoxic vector. The AAV ITRs or modifications thereof confer infectivity and site specific integration but not cytotoxicity and the promoter directs cell specific expression. U.S. Pat. No. 6 261 834 is herein incorporated by reference for material related to the AAV vector.

The disclosed vectors thus provide DNA molecules which are capable of integration into a mammalian chromosome without substantial toxicity.

The inserted genes in viral and retroviral vectors usually contain promoters and or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors and may contain upstream elements and response elements.

Molecular genetic experiments with large human herpesviruses have provided a means whereby large heterologous DNA fragments can be cloned propagated and established in cells permissive for infection with herpesviruses Sun et al. Nature genetics 8 33 41 1994 Cotter and Robertson Curr Opin Mol Ther 5 633 644 1999 . These large DNA viruses herpes simplex virus HSV and Epstein Barr virus EBV have the potential to deliver fragments of human heterologous DNA 150 kb to specific cells. EBV recombinants can maintain large pieces of DNA in the infected B cells as episomal DNA. Individual clones carrying human genomic inserts up to 330 kb appeared genetically stable. The maintenance of these episomes requires a specific EBV nuclear protein EBNA1 constitutively expressed during infection with EBV. Additionally these vectors can be used for transfection where large amounts of protein can be generated transiently in vitro. Herpesvirus amplicon systems are also being used to package pieces of DNA 220 kb and to infect cells that can stably maintain DNA as episomes.

Other useful systems include for example replicating and host restricted non replicating vaccinia virus vectors.

Nucleic acids that are delivered to cells which are to be integrated into the host cell genome typically contain integration sequences. These sequences are often viral related sequences particularly when viral based systems are used. These viral intergration systems can also be incorporated into nucleic acids which are to be delivered using a non nucleic acid based system of delivery such as a liposome so that the nucleic acid contained in the delivery system can become integrated into the host genome.

Other general techniques for integration into the host genome include for example systems designed to promote homologous recombination with the host genome. These systems typically rely on sequence flanking the nucleic acid to be expressed that has enough homology with a target sequence within the host cell genome that recombination between the vector nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid takes place causing the delivered nucleic acid to be integrated into the host genome. These systems and the methods necessary to promote homologous recombination are known to those of skill in the art.

The disclosed compositions can be delivered to the target cells in a variety of ways. For example the compositions can be delivered through electroporation through lipofection or through calcium phosphate precipitation. The delivery mechanism chosen will depend in part on the type of cell targeted and whether the delivery is occurring for example in vivo or in vitro.

Thus the compositions can comprise in addition to the disclosed nucleic acids peptides or vectors for example lipids such as liposomes such as cationic liposomes e.g. DOTMA DOPE DC cholesterol or anionic liposomes. Liposomes can further comprise proteins to facilitate targeting a particular cell if desired. Administration of a composition comprising a compound and a cationic liposome can be administered to the blood afferent to a target organ or inhaled into the respiratory tract to target cells of the respiratory tract. Regarding liposomes see e.g. Brigham et al. 1 95 100 1989 Felgner et al. 84 7413 7417 1987 U.S. Pat. No. 4 897 355. Furthermore the compound can be administered as a component of a microcapsule that can be targeted to specific cell types such as macrophages or where the diffusion of the compound or delivery of the compound from the microcapsule is designed for a specific rate or dosage.

In the methods described above which include the administration and uptake of exogenous DNA into the cells of a subject i.e. gene transduction or transfection delivery of the compositions to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example delivery can be via a liposome using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN LIPOFECTAMINE GIBCO BRL Inc. Gaithersburg Md. SUPERFECT Qiagen Inc. Hilden Germany and TRANSFECTAM Promega Biotec Inc. Madison Wis. as well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. In addition the disclosed nucleic acid or vector can be delivered in vivo by electroporation the technology for which is available from Genetronics Inc. San Diego Calif. as well as by means of a SONOPORATION machine ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp. Tucson Ariz. .

The materials may be in solution or in suspension for example incorporated into microparticles liposomes or cells . These may be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies receptors or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue the principles of which can be applied to targeting of other cells Senter et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 2 447 451 1991 Bagshawe K. D. Br. J. Cancer 60 275 281 1989 Bagshawe et al. Br. J. Cancer 58 700 703 1988 Senter et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 4 3 9 1993 Battelli et al. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 35 421 425 1992 Pietersz and McKenzie Immunolog. Reviews 129 57 80 1992 and Roffler et al. Biochem. Pharmacol 42 2062 2065 1991 . These techniques can be used for a variety of other specific cell types. Vehicles such as stealth and other antibody conjugated liposomes including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands lymphocyte directed tumor targeting and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in vivo. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue Hughes et al. Cancer Research 49 6214 6220 1989 and Litzinger and Huang Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1104 179 187 1992 . In general receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin coated pits enter the cell via clathrin coated vesicles pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted and then either recycle to the cell surface become stored intracellularly or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions such as nutrient uptake removal of activated proteins clearance of macromolecules opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins dissociation and degradation of ligand and receptor level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway depending on the cell type receptor concentration type of ligand ligand valency and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor mediated endocytosis has been reviewed Brown and Greene DNA and Cell Biology 10 6 399 409 1991 .

Nucleic acids that are delivered to cells which are to be integrated into the host cell genome typically contain integration sequences. These sequences are often viral related sequences particularly when viral based systems are used. These viral intergration systems can also be incorporated into nucleic acids which are to be delivered using a non nucleic acid based system of delivery such as a liposome so that the nucleic acid contained in the delivery system can become integrated into the host genome.

Other general techniques for integration into the host genome include for example systems designed to promote homologous recombination with the host genome. These systems typically rely on sequence flanking the nucleic acid to be expressed that has enough homology with a target sequence within the host cell genome that recombination between the vector nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid takes place causing the delivered nucleic acid to be integrated into the host genome. These systems and the methods necessary to promote homologous recombination are known to those of skill in the art.

The nucleic acids that are delivered to cells typically contain expression controlling systems. For example the inserted genes in viral and retroviral systems usually contain promoters and or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function s when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors and may contain upstream elements and response elements.

Preferred promoters controlling transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells may be obtained from various sources for example the genomes of viruses such as polyoma Simian Virus 40 SV40 adenovirus retroviruses hepatitis B virus and most preferably cytomegalovirus or from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. beta actin promoter. The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication Fiers et al. Nature 273 113 1978 . The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment Greenway P. J. et al. Gene 18 355 360 1982 . Of course promoters from the host cell or related species also are useful herein.

Enhancer generally refers to a sequence of DNA that functions at no fixed distance from the transcription start site and can be either 5 Laimins L. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78 993 1981 or 3 Lusky M. L. et al. Mol. Cell. Bio. 3 1108 1983 to the transcription unit. Furthermore enhancers can be within an intron Banerji J. L. et al. Cell 33 729 1983 as well as within the coding sequence itself Osborne T. F. et al. Mol. Cell. Bio. 4 1293 1984 . They are usually between 10 and 300 by in length and they function in cis. Enhancers function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers also often contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Promoters can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Enhancers often determine the regulation of expression of a gene. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Preferred examples are the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers.

The promotor and or enhancer may be specifically activated either by light or specific chemical events which trigger their function. Systems can be regulated by reagents such as tetracycline and dexamethasone. There are also ways to enhance viral vector gene expression by exposure to irradiation such as gamma irradiation or alkylating chemotherapy drugs.

In certain embodiments the promoter and or enhancer region can act as a constitutive promoter and or enhancer to maximize expression of the region of the transcription unit to be transcribed. In certain constructs the promoter and or enhancer region is active in all eukaryotic cell types even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. A preferred promoter of this type is the CMV promoter 650 bases . Other preferred promoters are SV40 promoters cytomegalovirus full length promoter and retroviral vector LTR.

It has been shown that all specific regulatory elements can be cloned and used to construct expression vectors that are selectively expressed in specific cell types such as melanoma cells. The glial fibrillary acetic protein GFAP promoter has been used to selectively express genes in cells of glial origin.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription which may affect mRNA expression. These regions are transcribed as polyadenylated segments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding tissue factor protein. The 3 untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites. It is preferred that the transcription unit also contains a polyadenylation region. One benefit of this region is that it increases the likelihood that the transcribed unit will be processed and transported like mRNA. The identification and use of polyadenylation signals in expression constructs is well established. It is preferred that homologous polyadenylation signals be used in the transgene constructs. In certain transcription units the polyadenylation region is derived from the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and consists of about 400 bases. It is also preferred that the transcribed units contain other standard sequences alone or in combination with the above sequences to improve expression from or stability of the construct.

The viral vectors can include nucleic acid sequence encoding a marker product. This marker product is used to determine if the gene has been delivered to the cell and once delivered is being expressed. Preferred marker genes are the lacZ gene which encodes galactosidase and green fluorescent protein.

In some embodiments the marker may be a selectable marker. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are dihydrofolate reductase DHFR thymidine kinase neomycin neomycin analog G418 hydromycin and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. There are two widely used distinct categories of selective regimes. The first category is based on a cell s metabolism and the use of a mutant cell line which lacks the ability to grow independent of supplemented media. Two examples are CHO DHF cells and mouse LTKcells. These cells lack the ability to grow without the addition of such nutrients as thymidine or hypoxanthine. Because these cells lack certain genes necessary for a complete nucleotide synthesis pathway they cannot survive unless the missing nucleotides are provided in a supplemented media. An alternative to supplementing the media is to introduce an intact DHFR or TK gene into cells lacking the respective genes thus altering their growth requirements. Individual cells which were not transformed with the DHFR or TK gene will not be capable of survival in non supplemented media.

The second category is dominant selection which refers to a selection scheme used in any cell type and does not require the use of a mutant cell line. These schemes typically use a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells which have a novel gene would express a protein conveying drug resistance and would survive the selection. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin Southern P. and Berg P. J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1 327 1982 mycophenolic acid Mulligan R. C. and Berg P. Science 209 1422 1980 or hygromycin Sugden B. et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 5 410 413 1985 . The three examples employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug G418 or neomycin geneticin xgpt mycophenolic acid or hygromycin respectively. Others include the neomycin analog G418 and puramycin.

The provided polypeptide can further constitute a fusion protein or otherwise have additional N terminal C terminal or intermediate amino acid sequences e.g. linkers or tags. Linker as used herein is an amino acid sequence or insertion that can be used to connect or separate two distinct polypeptides or polypeptide fragments wherein the linker does not otherwise contribute to the essential function of the composition. A polypeptide provided herein can have an amino acid linker comprising for example the amino acids GLS ALS or LLA. A tag as used herein refers to a distinct amino acid sequence that can be used to detect or purify the provided polypeptide wherein the tag does not otherwise contribute to the essential function of the composition. The provided polypeptide can further have deleted N terminal C terminal or intermediate amino acids that do not contribute to the essential activity of the polypeptide.

The disclosed composition can be linked to an internalization sequence or a protein transduction domain to effectively enter the cell. Recent studies have identified several cell penetrating peptides including the TAT transactivation domain of the HIV virus antennapedia and transportan that can readily transport molecules and small peptides across the plasma membrane Schwarze et al. 1999 Derossi et al. 1996 Yuan et al. 2002 . More recently polyarginine has shown an even greater efficiency of transporting peptides and proteins across the plasma membrane making it an attractive tool for peptide mediated transport Fuchs and Raines 2004 . Nonaarginine R SEQ ID NO 18 has been described as one of the most efficient polyarginine based protein transduction domains with maximal uptake of significantly greater than TAT or antennapeadia. Peptide mediated cytotoxicity has also been shown to be less with polyarginine based internalization sequences. R mediated membrane transport is facilitated through heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding and endocytic packaging. Once internalized heparan is degraded by heparanases releasing Rwhich leaks into the cytoplasm Deshayes et al. 2005 . Studies have recently shown that derivatives of polyarginine can deliver a full length p53 protein to oral cancer cells suppressing their growth and metastasis defining polyarginine as a potent cell penetrating peptide Takenobu et al. 2002 .

Thus the provided polypeptide can comprise a cellular internalization transporter or sequence. The cellular internalization sequence can be any internalization sequence known or newly discovered in the art or conservative variants thereof. Non limiting examples of cellular internalization transporters and sequences include Polyarginine e.g. R Antennapedia sequences TAT HIV Tat Penetratin Antp 3A Antp mutant Buforin II Transportan MAP model amphipathic peptide K FGF Ku70 Prion pVEC Pep 1 SynB1 Pep 7 HN 1 BGSC Bis Guanidinium Spermidine Cholesterol and BGTC Bis Guanidinium Tren Cholesterol see Table 4 .

Any other internalization sequences now known or later identified can be combined with a peptide of the invention.

The herein provided compositions can further comprise an effector molecule. By effector molecule is meant a substance that acts upon the target cell s or tissue to bring about a desired effect. The effect can for example be the labeling activating repressing or killing of the target cell s or tissue. Thus the effector molecule can for example be a small molecule pharmaceutical drug toxin fatty acid detectable marker conjugating tag nanoparticle or enzyme.

Examples of small molecules and pharmaceutical drugs that can be conjugated to a targeting peptide are known in the art. The effector can be a cytotoxic small molecule or drug that kills the target cell. The small molecule or drug can be designed to act on any critical cellular function or pathway. For example the small molecule or drug can inhibit the cell cycle activate protein degradation induce apoptosis modulate kinase activity or modify cytoskeletal proteins. Any known or newly discovered cytotoxic small molecule or drugs is contemplated for use with the targeting peptides.

The effector can be a toxin that kills the targeted cell. Non limiting examples of toxins include abrin modeccin ricin and diphtheria toxin. Other known or newly discovered toxins are contemplated for use with the provided compositions.

Fatty acids i.e. lipids that can be conjugated to the provided compositions include those that allow the efficient incorporation of the peptide into liposomes. Generally the fatty acid is a polar lipid. Thus the fatty acid can be a phospholipid. The provided compositions can comprise either natural or synthetic phospholipid. The phospholipids can be selected from phospholipids containing saturated or unsaturated mono or disubstituted fatty acids and combinations thereof. These phospholipids can be dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylserine dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol dioleoylphosphatidic acid palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmitoyloleoylphophatidylglycerol palmitoyloleoylphosphatidic acid palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylserine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidic acid myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylserine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylethanoamine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidic acid dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine dilinoleoylphosphatidylserine dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dilinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol dilinoleoylphosphatidic acid palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylcholine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylserine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidic acid. These phospholipids may also be the monoacylated derivatives of phosphatidylcholine lysophophatidylidylcholine phosphatidylserine lysophosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylethanolamine phophatidylglycerol lysophosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid lysophosphatidic acid . The monoacyl chain in these lysophosphatidyl derivatives may be palimtoyl oleoyl palmitoleoyl linoleoyl myristoyl or myristoleoyl. The phospholipids can also be synthetic. Synthetic phospholipids are readily available commercially from various sources such as AVANTI Polar Lipids Albaster Ala. Sigma Chemical Company St. Louis Mo. . These synthetic compounds may be varied and may have variations in their fatty acid side chains not found in naturally occurring phospholipids. The fatty acid can have unsaturated fatty acid side chains with C14 C16 C18 or C20 chains length in either or both the PS or PC. Synthetic phospholipids can have dioleoyl 18 1 PS palmitoyl 16 0 oleoyl 18 1 PS dimyristoyl 14 0 PS dipalmitoleoyl 16 1 PC dipalmitoyl 16 0 PC dioleoyl 18 1 PC palmitoyl 16 0 oleoyl 18 1 PC and myristoyl 14 0 oleoyl 18 1 PC as constituents. Thus as an example the provided compositions can comprise palmitoyl 16 0.

Detectable markers include any substance that can be used to label or stain a target tissue or cell s . Non limiting examples of detectable markers include radioactive isotopes enzymes fluorochromes and quantum dots Qdot . Other known or newly discovered detectable markers are contemplated for use with the provided compositions.

The effector molecule can be a nanoparticle such as a heat generating nanoshell. As used herein nanoshell is a nanoparticle having a discrete dielectric or semi conducting core section surrounded by one or more conducting shell layers. U.S. Pat. No. 6 530 944 is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for its teaching of the methods of making and using metal nanoshells. Nanoshells can be formed with a core of a dielectric or inert material such as silicon coated with a material such as a highly conductive metal which can be excited using radiation such as near infrared light approximately 800 to 1300 nm . Upon excitation the nanoshells emit heat. The resulting hyperthermia can kill the surrounding cell s or tissue. The combined diameter of the shell and core of the nanoshells ranges from the tens to the hundreds of nanometers. Near infrared light is advantageous for its ability to penetrate tissue. Other types of radiation can also be used depending on the selection of the nanoparticle coating and targeted cells. Examples include x rays magnetic fields electric fields and ultrasound. The problems with the existing methods for hyperthermia especially for use in cancer therapy such as the use of heated probes microwaves ultrasound lasers perfusion radiofrequency energy and radiant heating are avoided since the levels of radiation used as described herein are insufficient to induce hyperthermia except at the surface of the nanoparticles where the energy is more effectively concentrated by the metal surface on the dielectric. The particles can also be used to enhance imaging especially using infrared diffuse photon imaging methods. Targeting molecules can be antibodies or fragments thereof ligands for specific receptors or other proteins specifically binding to the surface of the cells to be targeted.

The effector molecule can be covalently linked to the disclosed peptide. The effector molecule can be linked to the amino terminal end of the disclosed peptide. The effector molecule can be linked to the carboxy terminal end of the disclosed peptide. The effector molecule can be linked to an amino acid within the disclosed peptide. The herein provided compositions can further comprise a linker connecting the effector molecule and disclosed peptide. The disclosed peptide can also be conjugated to a coating molecule such as bovine serum albumin BSA see Tkachenko et al. 2003 J Am Chem Soc 125 4700 4701 that can be used to coat the Nanoshells with the peptide.

It is understood that the disclosed nucleic acids and proteins can be represented as a sequence consisting of the nucleotides of amino acids. There are a variety of ways to display these sequences for example the nucleotide guanosine can be represented by G or g. Likewise the amino acid valine can be represented by Val or V. Those of skill in the art understand how to display and express any nucleic acid or protein sequence in any of the variety of ways that exist each of which is considered herein disclosed. Specifically contemplated herein is the display of these sequences on computer readable mediums such as commercially available floppy disks tapes chips hard drives compact disks and video disks or other computer readable mediums. Also disclosed are the binary code representations of the disclosed sequences. Those of skill in the art understand what computer readable mediums. Thus computer readable mediums on which the nucleic acids or protein sequences are recorded stored or saved are disclosed herein.

Disclosed are computer readable mediums comprising the sequences and information regarding the sequences set forth herein.

The disclosed compositions can be used as targets for any combinatorial technique to identify molecules or macromolecular molecules that interact with the disclosed compositions in a desired way. The DR3 and or TL1A nucleic acids peptides and related molecules disclosed herein can be used as targets for the combinatorial approaches. Also disclosed are the compositions that are identified through combinatorial techniques or screening techniques in which the compositions disclosed in SEQ ID NOS 1 2 3 or 4 or portions thereof are used as the target in a combinatorial or screening protocol.

It is understood that when using the disclosed compositions in combinatorial techniques or screening methods molecules such as macromolecular molecules will be identified that have particular desired properties such as inhibition or stimulation or the target molecule s function. The molecules identified and isolated when using the disclosed compositions such as in SEQ ID NOS 1 2 3 or 4 or portions thereof are also disclosed. Thus the products produced using the combinatorial or screening approaches that involve the disclosed compositions such as in SEQ ID NOS 1 2 3 or 4 or portions thereof are also considered herein disclosed.

It is understood that the disclosed methods for identifying molecules that inhibit the interactions between for example DR3 and TL1A can be performed using high throughput means. For example putative inhibitors can be identified using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer FRET to quickly identify interactions. The underlying theory of the techniques is that when two molecules are close in space i.e. interacting at a level beyond background a signal is produced or a signal can be quenched. Then a variety of experiments can be performed including for example adding in a putative inhibitor. If the inhibitor competes with the interaction between the two signaling molecules the signals will be removed from each other in space and this will cause a decrease or an increase in the signal depending on the type of signal used. This decreasing or increasing signal can be correlated to the presence or absence of the putative inhibitor. Any signaling means can be used. For example disclosed are methods of identifying an inhibitor of the interaction between any two of the disclosed molecules comprising contacting a first molecule and a second molecule together in the presence of a putative inhibitor wherein the first molecule or second molecule comprises a fluorescence donor wherein the first or second molecule typically the molecule not comprising the donor comprises a fluorescence acceptor and measuring Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer FRET in the presence of the putative inhibitor and the in absence of the putative inhibitor wherein a decrease in FRET in the presence of the putative inhibitor as compared to FRET measurement in its absence indicates the putative inhibitor inhibits binding between the two molecules. This type of method can be performed with a cell system as well.

Combinatorial chemistry includes but is not limited to all methods for isolating small molecules or macromolecules that are capable of binding either a small molecule or another macromolecule typically in an iterative process. Proteins oligonucleotides and sugars are examples of macromolecules. For example oligonucleotide molecules with a given function catalytic or ligand binding can be isolated from a complex mixture of random oligonucleotides in what has been referred to as in vitro genetics Szostak 19 89 1992 . One synthesizes a large pool of molecules bearing random and defined sequences and subjects that complex mixture for example approximately 10individual sequences in 100 g of a 100 nucleotide RNA to some selection and enrichment process. Through repeated cycles of affinity chromatography and PCR amplification of the molecules bound to the ligand on the column Ellington and Szostak 1990 estimated that 1 in 10RNA molecules folded in such a way as to bind a small molecule dye. DNA molecules with such ligand binding behavior have been isolated as well Ellington and Szostak 1992 Bock et al. 1992 . Techniques aimed at similar goals exist for small organic molecules proteins antibodies and other macromolecules known to those of skill in the art. Screening sets of molecules for a desired activity whether based on small organic libraries oligonucleotides or antibodies is broadly referred to as combinatorial chemistry. Combinatorial techniques are particularly suited for defining binding interactions between molecules and for isolating molecules that have a specific binding activity often called aptamers when the macromolecules are nucleic acids.

The disclosed compositions can be combined conjugated or coupled with or to carriers and other compositions to aid administration delivery or other aspects of the inhibitors and their use. For convenience such composition will be referred to herein as carriers. Carriers can for example be a small molecule pharmaceutical drug fatty acid detectable marker conjugating tag nanoparticle or enzyme.

The disclosed compositions can be used therapeutically in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By pharmaceutically acceptable is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable i.e. the material can be administered to a subject along with the composition without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject as would be well known to one of skill in the art.

Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in 19th ed. ed. A. R. Gennaro Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1995. Typically an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include but are not limited to saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8 and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon for instance the route of administration and concentration of composition being administered.

Pharmaceutical carriers are known to those skilled in the art. These most typically would be standard carriers for administration of drugs to humans including solutions such as sterile water saline and buffered solutions at physiological pH. The compositions can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Other compounds can be administered according to standard procedures used by those skilled in the art.

Pharmaceutical compositions can include carriers thickeners diluents buffers preservatives surface active agents and the like in addition to the molecule of choice. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include one or more active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents antiinflammatory agents anesthetics and the like.

Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions suspensions and emulsions. Examples of non aqueous solvents are propylene glycol polyethylene glycol vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water alcoholic aqueous solutions emulsions or suspensions including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution Ringer s dextrose dextrose and sodium chloride lactated Ringer s or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer s dextrose and the like. Preservatives and other additives can also be present such as for example antimicrobials anti oxidants chelating agents and inert gases and the like.

Formulations for topical administration can include ointments lotions creams gels drops suppositories sprays liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers aqueous powder or oily bases thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.

Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules suspensions or solutions in water or non aqueous media capsules sachets or tablets. Thickeners flavorings diluents emulsifiers dispersing aids or binders may be desirable.

Some of the compositions can potentially be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salt formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid perchloric acid nitric acid thiocyanic acid sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid glycolic acid lactic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid malonic acid succinic acid maleic acid and fumaric acid or by reaction with an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide and organic bases such as mono di trialkyl and aryl amines and substituted ethanolamines.

Cancer Research 49 6214 6220 1989 and Litzinger and Huang Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1104 179 187 1992 . In general receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin coated pits enter the cell via clathrin coated vesicles pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted and then either recycle to the cell surface become stored intracellularly or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions such as nutrient uptake removal of activated proteins clearance of macromolecules opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins dissociation and degradation of ligand and receptor level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway depending on the cell type receptor concentration type of ligand ligand valency and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor mediated endocytosis has been reviewed Brown and Greene DNA and Cell Biology 10 6 399 409 1991 .

The term nanoparticle refers to a nanoscale particle with a size that is measured in nanometers for example a nanoscopic particle that has at least one dimension of less than about 100 nm. Examples of nanoparticles include paramagnetic nanoparticles superparamagnetic nanoparticles metal nanoparticles fullerene like materials inorganic nanotubes dendrimers such as with covalently attached metal chelates nanofibers nanohoms nano onions nanorods nanoropes and quantum dots. A nanoparticle can produce a detectable signal for example through absorption and or emission of photons including radio frequency and visible photons and plasmon resonance.

Microspheres or microbubbles can also be used with the methods disclosed herein. Microspheres containing chromophores have been utilized in an extensive variety of applications including photonic crystals biological labeling and flow visualization in microfluidic channels. See for example Y. Lin et al. Appl. Phys Lett. 2002 81 3134 D. Wang et al. Chem. Mater. 2003 15 2724 X. Gao et al. J. Biomed. Opt. 2002 7 532 M. Han et al. Nature Biotechnology. 2001 19 631 V. M. Pai et al. Mag. Magnetic Mater. 1999 194 262 each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Both the photostability of the chromophores and the monodispersity of the microspheres can be important.

Nanoparticles such as for example silica nanoparticles metal nanoparticles metal oxide nanoparticles or semiconductor nanocrystals can be incorporated into microspheres. The optical magnetic and electronic properties of the nanoparticles can allow them to be observed while associated with the microspheres and can allow the microspheres to be identified and spatially monitored. For example the high photostability good fluorescence efficiency and wide emission tunability of colloidally synthesized semiconductor nanocrystals can make them an excellent choice of chromophore. Unlike organic dyes nanocrystals that emit different colors i.e. different wavelengths can be excited simultaneously with a single light source. Colloidally synthesized semiconductor nanocrystals such as for example core shell CdSe ZnS and CdS ZnS nanocrystals can be incorporated into microspheres. The microspheres can be monodisperse silica microspheres.

The nanoparticle can be a metal nanoparticle a metal oxide nanoparticle or a semiconductor nanocrystal. The metal of the metal nanoparticle or the metal oxide nanoparticle can include titanium zirconium hafnium vanadium niobium tantalum chromium molybdenum tungsten manganese technetium rhenium iron ruthenium osmium cobalt rhodium iridium nickel palladium platinum copper silver gold zinc cadmium scandium yttrium lanthanum a lanthanide series or actinide series element e.g. cerium praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium lutetium thorium protactinium and uranium boron aluminum gallium indium thallium silicon germanium tin lead antimony bismuth polonium magnesium calcium strontium and barium. In certain embodiments the metal can be iron ruthenium cobalt rhodium nickel palladium platinum silver gold cerium or samarium. The metal oxide can be an oxide of any of these materials or combination of materials. For example the metal can be gold or the metal oxide can be an iron oxide a cobalt oxide a zinc oxide a cerium oxide or a titanium oxide. Preparation of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles is described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 897 945 and 6 759 199 each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

For example the disclosed compositions can be immobilized on silica nanoparticles SNPs . SNPs have been widely used for biosensing and catalytic applications owing to their favorable surface area to volume ratio straightforward manufacture and the possibility of attaching fluorescent labels magnetic nanoparticles Yang H. H. et al. 2005 and semiconducting nanocrystals Lin Y. W. et al. 2006 .

The nanoparticle can also be for example a heat generating nanoshell. As used herein nanoshell is a nanoparticle having a discrete dielectric or semi conducting core section surrounded by one or more conducting shell layers. U.S. Pat. No. 6 530 944 is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for its teaching of the methods of making and using metal nanoshells.

Targeting molecules can be attached to the disclosed compositions and or carriers. For example the targeting molecules can be antibodies or fragments thereof ligands for specific receptors or other proteins specifically binding to the surface of the cells to be targeted.

 Liposome as the term is used herein refers to a structure comprising an outer lipid bi or multi layer membrane surrounding an internal aqueous space. Liposomes can be used to package any biologically active agent for delivery to cells.

Materials and procedures for forming liposomes are well known to those skilled in the art. Upon dispersion in an appropriate medium a wide variety of phospholipids swell hydrate and form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles with layers of aqueous media separating the lipid bilayers. These systems are referred to as multilamellar liposomes or multilamellar lipid vesicles MLVs and have diameters within the range of 10 nm to 100 m. These MLVs were first described by Bangham et al. J. Mol. Biol. 13 238 252 1965 . In general lipids or lipophilic substances are dissolved in an organic solvent. When the solvent is removed such as under vacuum by rotary evaporation the lipid residue forms a film on the wall of the container. An aqueous solution that typically contains electrolytes or hydrophilic biologically active materials is then added to the film. Large MLVs are produced upon agitation. When smaller MLVs are desired the larger vesicles are subjected to sonication sequential filtration through filters with decreasing pore size or reduced by other forms of mechanical shearing. There are also techniques by which MLVs can be reduced both in size and in number of lamellae for example by pressurized extrusion Barenholz et al. FEBS Lett. 99 210 214 1979 .

Liposomes can also take the form of unilammelar vesicles which are prepared by more extensive sonication of MLVs and consist of a single spherical lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous solution. Unilamellar vesicles ULVs can be small having diameters within the range of 20 to 200 nm while larger ULVs can have diameters within the range of 200 nm to 2 m. There are several well known techniques for making unilamellar vesicles. In Papahadjopoulos et al. Biochim et Biophys Acta 135 624 238 1968 sonication of an aqueous dispersion of phospholipids produces small ULVs having a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous solution. Schneider U.S. Pat. No. 4 089 801 describes the formation of liposome precursors by ultrasonication followed by the addition of an aqueous medium containing amphiphilic compounds and centrifugation to form a biomolecular lipid layer system.

Small ULVs can also be prepared by the ethanol injection technique described by Batzri et al. Biochim et Biophys Acta 298 1015 1019 1973 and the ether injection technique of Deamer et al. Biochim et Biophys Acta 443 629 634 1976 . These methods involve the rapid injection of an organic solution of lipids into a buffer solution which results in the rapid formation of unilamellar liposomes. Another technique for making ULVs is taught by Weder et al. in Liposome Technology ed. G. Gregoriadis CRC Press Inc. Boca Raton Fla. Vol. I Chapter 7 pg. 79 107 1984 . This detergent removal method involves solubilizing the lipids and additives with detergents by agitation or sonication to produce the desired vesicles.

Papahadjopoulos et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 235 871 describes the preparation of large ULVs by a reverse phase evaporation technique that involves the formation of a water in oil emulsion of lipids in an organic solvent and the drug to be encapsulated in an aqueous buffer solution. The organic solvent is removed under pressure to yield a mixture which upon agitation or dispersion in an aqueous media is converted to large ULVs. Suzuki et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 016 100 describes another method of encapsulating agents in unilamellar vesicles by freezing thawing an aqueous phospholipid dispersion of the agent and lipids.

In addition to the MLVs and ULVs liposomes can also be multivesicular. Described in Kim et al. Biochim et Biophys Acta 728 339 348 1983 these multivesicular liposomes are spherical and contain internal granular structures. The outer membrane is a lipid bilayer and the internal region contains small compartments separated by bilayer septum. Still yet another type of liposomes are oligolamellar vesicles OLVs which have a large center compartment surrounded by several peripheral lipid layers. These vesicles having a diameter of 2 15 m are described in Callo et al. Cryobiology 22 3 251 267 1985 .

Mezei et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 054 and 4 761 288 also describe methods of preparing lipid vesicles. More recently Hsu U.S. Pat. No. 5 653 996 describes a method of preparing liposomes utilizing aerosolization and Yiournas et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 497 describes a method for preparing liposomes utilizing a high velocity shear mixing chamber. Methods are also described that use specific starting materials to produce ULVs Wallach et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 853 228 or OLVs Wallach U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 474 848 and 5 628 936 .

A comprehensive review of all of the aforementioned lipid vesicles and methods for their preparation are described in Liposome Technology ed. G. Gregoriadis CRC Press Inc. Boca Raton Fla. Vol. I II III 1984 . This and the aforementioned references describing various lipid vesicles suitable for use in the invention are incorporated herein by reference.

Fatty acids i.e. lipids that can be conjugated to the provided compositions include those that allow the efficient incorporation of the proprotein convertase inhibitors into liposomes. Generally the fatty acid is a polar lipid. Thus the fatty acid can be a phospholipid. The provided compositions can comprise either natural or synthetic phospholipid. The phospholipids can be selected from phospholipids containing saturated or unsaturated mono or di substituted fatty acids and combinations thereof. These phospholipids can be dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylserine dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol dioleoylphosphatidic acid palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmitoyloleoylphophatidylglycerol palmitoyloleoylphosphatidic acid palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylserine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidic acid myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylserine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylethanoamine myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidic acid dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine dilinoleoylphosphatidylserine dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dilinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol dilinoleoylphosphatidic acid palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylcholine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylserine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidic acid. These phospholipids may also be the monoacylated derivatives of phosphatidylcholine lysophophatidylidylcholine phosphatidylserine lysophosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylethanolamine phophatidylglycerol lysophosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid lysophosphatidic acid . The monoacyl chain in these lysophosphatidyl derivatives may be palimtoyl oleoyl palmitoleoyl linoleoyl myristoyl or myristoleoyl. The phospholipids can also be synthetic. Synthetic phospholipids are readily available commercially from various sources such as AVANTI Polar Lipids Albaster Ala. Sigma Chemical Company St. Louis Mo. . These synthetic compounds may be varied and may have variations in their fatty acid side chains not found in naturally occurring phospholipids. The fatty acid can have unsaturated fatty acid side chains with C14 C16 C18 or C20 chains length in either or both the PS or PC. Synthetic phospholipids can have dioleoyl 18 1 PS palmitoyl 16 0 oleoyl 18 1 PS dimyristoyl 14 0 PS dipalmitoleoyl 16 1 PC dipalmitoyl 16 0 PC dioleoyl 18 1 PC palmitoyl 16 0 oleoyl 18 1 PC and myristoyl 14 0 oleoyl 18 1 PC as constituents. Thus as an example the provided compositions can comprise palmitoyl 16 0.

As described above the compositions can be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and can be delivered to the subject s cells in vivo and or ex vivo by a variety of mechanisms well known in the art e.g. uptake of naked DNA liposome fusion intramuscular injection of DNA via a gene gun endocytosis and the like .

If ex vivo methods are employed cells or tissues can be removed and maintained outside the body according to standard protocols well known in the art. The compositions can be introduced into the cells via any gene transfer mechanism such as for example calcium phosphate mediated gene delivery electroporation microinjection or proteoliposomes. The transduced cells can then be infused e.g. in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or homotopically transplanted back into the subject per standard methods for the cell or tissue type. Standard methods are known for transplantation or infusion of various cells into a subject.

The compositions disclosed herein and the compositions necessary to perform the disclosed methods can be made using any method known to those of skill in the art for that particular reagent or compound unless otherwise specifically noted.

A polynucleotide comprising naturally occurring nucleotides and phosphodiester bonds can be chemically synthesized or can be produced using recombinant DNA methods using an appropriate polynucleotide as a template. In comparison a polynucleotide comprising nucleotide analogs or covalent bonds other than phosphodiester bonds generally will be chemically synthesized although an enzyme such as T7 polymerase can incorporate certain types of nucleotide analogs into a polynucleotide and therefore can be used to produce such a polynucleotide recombinantly from an appropriate template Jellinek et al. Biochemistry 34 11363 11372 1995 .

For example the nucleic acids such as the oligonucleotides to be used as primers can be made using standard chemical synthesis methods or can be produced using enzymatic methods or any other known method. Such methods can range from standard enzymatic digestion followed by nucleotide fragment isolation see for example Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 Chapters 5 6 to purely synthetic methods for example by the cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method using a Milligen or Beckman System 1Plus DNA synthesizer for example Model 8700 automated synthesizer of Milligen Biosearch Burlington Mass. or ABI Model 380B . Synthetic methods useful for making oligonucleotides are also described by Ikuta et al. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 53 323 356 1984 phosphotriester and phosphite triester methods and Narang et al. Methods Enzymol. 65 610 620 1980 phosphotriester method . Protein nucleic acid molecules can be made using known methods such as those described by Nielsen et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 5 3 7 1994 .

One method of producing the disclosed proteins such as SEQ ID NO 23 is to link two or more peptides or polypeptides together by protein chemistry techniques. For example peptides or polypeptides can be chemically synthesized using currently available laboratory equipment using either Fmoc 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl or Boc tert butyloxycarbonoyl chemistry Applied Biosystems Inc. Foster City Calif. . One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that a peptide or polypeptide corresponding to the disclosed proteins for example can be synthesized by standard chemical reactions. For example a peptide or polypeptide can be synthesized and not cleaved from its synthesis resin whereas the other fragment of a peptide or protein can be synthesized and subsequently cleaved from the resin thereby exposing a terminal group which is functionally blocked on the other fragment. By peptide condensation reactions these two fragments can be covalently joined via a peptide bond at their carboxyl and amino termini respectively to form an antibody or fragment thereof. Grant G A 1992 Synthetic Peptides A User Guide. W.H. Freeman and Co. N.Y. 1992 Bodansky M and Trost B. Ed. 1993 Principles of Peptide Synthesis. Springer Verlag Inc. NY which is herein incorporated by reference at least for material related to peptide synthesis. Alternatively the peptide or polypeptide is independently synthesized in vivo as described herein. Once isolated these independent peptides or polypeptides may be linked to form a peptide or fragment thereof via similar peptide condensation reactions.

For example enzymatic ligation of cloned or synthetic peptide segments allows relatively short peptide fragments to be joined to produce larger peptide fragments polypeptides or whole protein domains Abrahmsen L et al. Biochemistry 30 4151 1991 . Alternatively native chemical ligation of synthetic peptides can be utilized to synthetically construct large peptides or polypeptides from shorter peptide fragments. This method consists of a two step chemical reaction Dawson et al. Synthesis of Proteins by Native Chemical Ligation. Science 266 776 779 1994 . The first step is the chemoselective reaction of an unprotected synthetic peptide thioester with another unprotected peptide segment containing an amino terminal Cys residue to give a thioester linked intermediate as the initial covalent product. Without a change in the reaction conditions this intermediate undergoes spontaneous rapid intramolecular reaction to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site Baggiolini M et al. 1992 FEBS Lett. 307 97 101 Clark Lewis I et al. J. Biol. Chem. 269 16075 1994 Clark Lewis I et al. Biochemistry 30 3128 1991 Rajarathnam K et al. Biochemistry 33 6623 30 1994 .

Alternatively unprotected peptide segments are chemically linked where the bond formed between the peptide segments as a result of the chemical ligation is an unnatural non peptide bond Schnolzer M et al. Science 256 221 1992 . This technique has been used to synthesize analogs of protein domains as well as large amounts of relatively pure proteins with full biological activity deLisle Milton R C et al. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press New York pp. 257 267 1992 .

In addition to endothelial cells TL1A is rapidly upregulated and secreted from dendritic cells after stimulation through TLR4 or TRL11 in a myd88 dependent manner and is also inducible by activated T cells in part through CD40L CD40 interactions. T cells themselves upregulate TL1A after activation with delayed kinetics. Exogenous and endogenous TL1A can costimulate na ve T cell proliferation and cytokine production through DR3. Cytokine production by differentiated effector cells is inefficient in DR3 deficient T cells but can be largely overcome by strong stimuli or the presence of dendritic cells. In vivo DR3 deficient mice display defects in T cell dependent immunopathology in EAE and asthma models but systemic T cell polarization and effector function are preserved. DR3 thus functions as a specific potentiator of cytokine production and immunopathology in inflamed tissues and as such presents a target for therapy of T cell mediated autoimmune disease

Myeloid DC produce soluble TL1A rapidly following both innate immune stimuli in a TLR and Myd88 dependent fashion whereas T cells produce lower amounts of TL1A more slowly and T cell derived TL1A is not shed into the supernatant. It was determined that TL1A added exogenously or produced by DC but not T cells alone can costimulate na ve T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Differentiation into Th1 and Th2 effector cells is not dependent on DR3 although the efficiency of cytokine production under sub optimal conditions is affected. In vivo DR3 deficient T cells differentiate into effector cells which can produce cytokines in the spleen and lymph nodes. However DR3 deficient mice are resistant to two distinct models of T cell dependent autoimmunity with reduced production of effector cytokines at the site of inflammation. TL1A DR3 interactions thus potentiate effector T cell function in target tissues contributing to T cell mediated immunopathology.

When human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were activated with antibodies against the T cell receptor a rapid and dramatic upregulation of TL1A mRNA occurred peaking at 6 hours with 1000 fold induction . However when T and B cells were purified from peripheral blood and activated in isolation TL1A upregulation was much slower peaking at 48 hours with less than 100 fold induction. This indicates that non lymphocyte antigen presenting cells may be the major source of TL1A for T cells during initial activation. In purified murine splenic and bone marrow derived CD11c DC TL1A mRNA was rapidly upregulated by LPS peaking at 3 hours and returning to baseline by 12 hours . To explore the stimuli that induce TL1A in more detail the parasite derived immunostimulatory molecules tachyzoite Antigen from STAg and Egg Antigen from SEA were used which led to differential DC activation programs that prime T cells for Th1 and Th2 responses respectively. Dendritic cells stimulated with STAg but not with SEA strongly upregulated TL1A mRNA with similar kinetics to LPS right panel . Even after up to 24 hours SEA did not induce TL1A lower panel . Experiments with DC from various knockout mice showed that TL1A induction was dependent on Myd88 and TIRAP and LPS induction of TL1A was TLR4 dependent . When highly purified mouse T cells were activated through the TCR similar TL1A upregulation was observed with delayed kinetics seen in human T cells . These data show that like other TNF family members TL1A can be acutely upregulated in DC through TLRs and the Myd88 TIRAP dependent signaling pathway. DC derived TL1A would be available to modulate the initial phases of T cell activation whereas T cells upregulate TL1A more slowly where it may influence later steps in T cell expansion and differentiation.

Exogenous TL1A has previously been shown to costimulate T cells but whether this is dependent on DR3 and what role endogenously produced TL1A plays in mature T cell activation has not been investigated. To investigate this CD4 T cells were purified from spleens and lymph nodes of wild type WT C567Bl 6 or isogenic DR3 knockout KO mice and activated in the presence or absence of recombinant murine TL1A. Costimulation by other TNF family members has been shown to be maximal when CD28 mediated costimulation is blocked Croft 2003 . Exogenously added TL1A consistently increased T cell proliferation and this effect was more apparent in the absence of CD28 mediated costimulation . With dual CD3 CD28 crosslinking TL1A only costimulated proliferation at lower doses of anti CD3. Importantly DR3 KO cells were completely unresponsive to TL1A indicating that DR3 is the major receptor that mediates costimulation by TL1A. Also similar to their previously reported normal proliferation in response to ConA Wang et al. 2001 purified T cells from WT and DR3 KO mice proliferated similarly in response to anti CD3 with or without costimulation . To determine if the increased thymidine incorporation triggered by TL1A was due to increased cell cycling versus effects on cell survival CFSE dilution experiments were performed under similar conditions. In accordance with the thymidine incorporation data exogenous TL1A significantly increased CFSE dilution reflecting increased cell cycling especially in the absence of CD28 signaling . No changes in cell viability in response to TL1A were detected in these experiments.

To investigate the spectrum of cytokines that can be costimulated by TL1A and the dependence of cytokine production on DR3 IL 2 interferon IFN and IL 4 production were measured in WT or DR3 KO T cells activated in the presence or absence of recombinant TL1A. TL1A increased IL 2 production interferon production and IL 4 production by WT but not DR3 KO cells activated with or without CD28. IL 4 was the cytokine most prominently induced by TL1A increasing by approximately 10 fold whereas IL 2 and interferon increased less than two fold . DR3 deficient T cells were unresponsive to TL1A but had no defect in cytokine production. Thus as with proliferative responses DR3 is the major mediator of TL1A signaling and endogenously produced T cell derived TL1A is not necessary for cytokine production by activated T cells under these conditions. To determine if TL1A driven proliferation is due to increased IL 2 production an anti CD25 blocking antibody was added during T cell activation in the presence or absence of TL1A. CD25 blockade blocked most of the increased proliferation induced by TL1A but some IL 2 independent proliferation could still be seen indicating that TL1A driven costimulation is at least partly dependent on increased production of IL 2 .

Since purified DR3 deficient T cells did not have major defects in proliferative responses or cytokine production the TL1A produced by T cells did not seem to be essential for these functions. Thus the TL1A produced by dendritic cells during cognate DC T cell interactions may be the more relevant source of TL1A for T cell costimulation. To test this experiments with DR3 WT or KO mice crossed to the Ovalbumin Ova specific TCR transgenic line OT II were performed. Purified DR 3 deficient cells were co cultured with C57Bl 6 bone marrow derived DC and the cognate Ova peptide. Under these conditions proliferation of DR3 KO cells was diminished especially in the presence of low concentration of Ova peptide with or without CTLA4 Ig blockade. Cytokine production by OT II T cells is characteristically dependent on the dose of antigen with higher doses favoring IFN production and lower doses favoring IL 4 production. DR3 KO OT II cells produced approximately 50 lower IL 2 at lower doses of Ova and lower amounts of IL 4 at all doses of Ova tested . Thus endogenous TL1A produced by dendritic cells is likely to be a physiologically important source of this costimulatory TNF family member.

To investigate the consequences of TL1A DR3 interactions for later steps in T cell differentiation DR3 deficient T cells were tested for effector cytokine production in two types of T cell polarization assays. Purified T cells from WT or DR3 KO mice were activated with either IL 4 and anti IFN for Th2 polarization or IL 12 and anti IL 4 for Th1 polarization. When purified T cells were re stimulated after 5 6 days of activation and polarization there were significant defects in the percentages of cells producing IFN and IL 4 when T cells were re stimulated through the TCR. However the combination of PMA ionomycin allowed normal production of these cytokines . Interestingly IL 17 production by polarized T cells polarized to this effector type by a combination of TGF beta IL 1 IL 6 TNF and blockade of IL 4 and IL 12 was defective in supernatants 72 hours after primary activation and after re stimulation with CD3 CD28. Since PMA ionomycin stimulation appeared to bypass the cytokine secretion defect the defect in DR3 KO cells may be more in TCR induced cytokine secretion rather than T cell differentiation itself. To determine whether T cell differentiation was intact in the absence of DR3 the levels of T bet and GATA 3 the canonical transcription factors that program Th1 and Th2 T cell differentiation respectively were measured. As shown in induction of T bet in DR3 KO T cells polarized to differentiate into Th1 cells was normal and GATA 3 induction under Th2 conditions was only slightly impaired. Thus it appeared that DR3 is more important in cytokine production than in programming T cells for differentiation into a particular T cell subset. To determine if this was also the case when TL1A was provided by dendritic cells T cells from DR3 KO OT II mice or OT II controls were cultured with antigen and DC under conditions in which polarization is driven by exogenous cytokines or endogenous factors produced under the influence of the parasite derived antigens SEA or STag. No defects in IFN were found when DR3 KO T cells were polarized with Stag or exogenous IL 12 and anti IL4 . However a significant defect in IL 4 production was seen in T cells activated in the presence of SEA. This was overcome by addition of exogenous IL 4. Unlike STAg induced Th1 polarization that does not require T cell derived IFN Th2 polarization by SEA is known to be dependent on T cell derived IL 4. Thus the defect in IL 4 production by DR3 KO T cells that was observed may account for the Th2 polarization defect in the absence of exogenous IL 4.

To determine whether the Th2 polarization defect in vitro was significant in an animal model of a Th2 mediated disease how DR3 KO mice would respond in an Ova dependent asthma model was investigated. Mice were sensitized with Alum and Ova protein or Alum and PBS as a control and then challenged intratracheally and intranasally with either Ova protein or PBS. The mice were sacrificed two days after the last challenge. The histology showed that the DR3 KO mice lungs had less mucin production than the WT mice and also less peribroncheal cuffing . The histopathology score for the DR3 KO lungs was also reduced compare to the WT lungs . In addition the inflammation in the DR3 KO lungs was predominantly lymphocytic in the DR3 KO versus the typical eosinophilic infiltrates in the WT lungs. Next the mRNA levels of different cytokines in the lung were determined. DR3 KO lungs have reduced IL 13 a reflection of the mucus production and IL 5 in the lungs compared to the WT lungs . In addition whether the Ova specific restimulation of the spleen was affected was determined. Interestingly in contrast to the cytokine mRNA level observed in the lung there were no differences in cytokine production suggesting a more local effect. In addition there was no difference between the WT and DR3 KO mice T cell proliferation. The level of IgG1 present in the serum was also determined. There was no difference in IgG1 IgG2 sera level between WT and DR3 KO mice especially in the Ova specific IgG1 level suggesting a more local effect of the differences in the pathology. The fact that the IgG1 production was elevated after the Ova challenge in the DR3 KO mice compared to PBS treated mice indicates that the T cells were able to respond and differentiate even if it is to a lesser extent data from in vitro polarization . Thus the decrease in local inflammation may be due to a defect in a late stage of the immune response.

As the DR3 KO mice have a decrease in Th2Th2 T cell mediated pathology in the asthma model correlating with a decrease in in vitro Th2 differentiation how DR3 KO mice would respond to a Th1 Th17 mediated disease was investigated. To this end a MOG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced EAE mouse model was used. DR3 KO mice have a delayed and reduced EAE pathology compared to WT mice that develop clinical pathology about one week after MOG injection . This indicates that DR3 KO mice have reduced pathology in disease models that are dependent on entirely different cytokines. In addition similar to the Ova asthma model the MOG restimulation of the T cells from the spleen and the lymph nodes was not impaired . This again indicates that the overall effect of the DR3 TL1A defect seemed to be more local than systemic. Several recent reports indicate that additional subsets of effector T cells such as IL 17 producing cells are produced during immune responses. This population of IL 17 producing cells was thought to be responsible for the pathogenicity in Th1 mediated diseases rather than effector cells producing Th1 cytokines. Thus to determine to what extent the IL 17 producing cells were present in the brain spleen and lymph nodes hematopoietic cells were taken from the spinal cord and stimulated for 6 hours with PMA ionomycin before intracellular staining for IL 17 and IFN . Decreased IL 17 producing cells were present in the CNS from DR3 KO mice compared to WT mice. In addition DR3 KO mice have twice as many T cells in the CNS as WT mice. However there was no difference in the spleen or in the lymph nodes.

Exogenous TL1A can costimulate human and mouse T cells but whether DR3 is the sole costimulatory receptor for TL1A and what role endogenously produced TL1A plays in mature T cell activation is not known. To investigate this CD4 T cells were purified from spleens and lymph nodes of wild type WT or age and sex matched DR3 knockout DR3 KO mice Wang et al. 2001 on a C57BL 6 background and activated through the TCR in the presence or absence of recombinant murine TL1A. Costimulation by other TNF family members has been shown to be maximal when CD28 mediated costimulation is blocked Croft 2003 . TL1A also increased T cell proliferation most dramatically in the absence of CD28 mediated costimulation . When CD28 mediated costimulation was present TL1A only costimulated proliferation at lower doses of anti CD3 . The increased thymidine incorporation was due to increased cell division and not enhanced survival as increased CFSE dilution and no significant changes in cellular viability induced by TL1A were observed. Importantly DR3 KO cells were unresponsive to TL1A indicating that DR3 is the major receptor that mediates costimulation by TL1A . However stimulation of DR3 through endogenous T cell derived TL1A was apparently dispensable for T cell proliferation since there were no deficits in proliferation in cultures of purified DR3 KO T cells . TL1A costimulation was largely dependent on increased IL 2 production as TL1A induced proliferation was greatly reduced in IL 2 deficient T cells or after the addition of an antagonistic anti IL 2R antibody .

To investigate the spectrum of cytokines that can be costimulated by TL1A and the dependence of cytokine production on DR3 IL 2 IFN and IL 4 production were measured in WT or DR3 KO T cells activated in the presence or absence of recombinant TL1A. TL1A increased IL 2 IFN and IL 4 production by WT but not by DR3 KO T cells with IL 4 being most prominently induced by TL1A in the presence of CD28 costimulation . DR3 deficient T cells were unresponsive to TL1A but had no defects in cytokine production compared to wild type T cells. Thus as with proliferative responses DR3 is required for TL1A induced costimulation but endogenously produced T cell derived TL1A is not necessary for cytokine production by activated T cells under these conditions. Upregulation of the activation markers CD25 IL 2R and CD69 was enhanced by TL1A especially at 24 hours after activation but no defects in activation marker expression were observed in DR3 deficient T cells compared with wild type controls . TL1A has been reported to costimulate memory but not na ve T cells Bamias et al. 2006 . To address this issue CD62Lhi CD4410 na ve CD4 T cells were purified from WT and DR3 deficient mice and activated with or without exogenous TL1A. TL1A mildly enhanced proliferation with or without CD28 costimulation and also strongly increased IL 2 and IFN production in a DR3 dependent manner B showing that DR3 can function in na ve T cells. Percentages of memory phenotype CD44hi CD4 T cells were also identical in age matched DR3 KO and control mice indicating that TL1A costimulation of unseparated T cells is unlikely to be due to differences in the percentages of memory and na ve cells.

b. Dendritic Cells Produce TL1A in Response to TLR and Fc R Stimuli and can Costimulate T Cells Through DR3

The lack of proliferative or cytokine production defects in purified DR3 deficient T cells suggested that other cell types may be the physiological source of TL1A. TL1A has been reported to be produced by human DC and monocytes after a variety of stimuli and DCs would be a source of TL1A produced at the appropriate time and place for T cell costimulation. To test this upregulation of TL1A gene expression was measured by Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR RT qPCR in purified splenic CD11c dendritic cells and bone marrow derived DC stimulated with a variety of agents. LPS and Soluble Tachyzoite Antigen from STAg stimuli that act through Toll Like receptors TLR s and that can induce expression of other TNF family members induced rapid upregulatation of TL1A with expression peaking at up to 100 fold above baseline at 3 hours and rapidly declining after that . Interestingly Egg Antigen SEA from which triggers alternative activation of DC to program T cells for Th2 differentiation did not appreciably induce TL1A mRNA left panel . Stimulation of dendritic cells deficient in TLR signaling components showed that LPS induction of TL1A is mediated by TLR4 in a manner dependent on MyD88 and TIRAP . Immune complexes acting through low affinity Fc receptors have recently been shown to be a potent stimulus for TL1A production Cassatella et al. 2007 Prehn et al. 2007 . Stimulation of murine DC with plate bound crosslinked mouse Ig IC also stimulated TL1A gene expression comparably to LPS . Thus like other TNF family members TL1A can be rapidly induced in DC through TLR and immune complexes. To test whether T cells could serve as an autocrine source of TL1A purified T cells were stimulated through the TCR and TL1A mRNA levels were measured by RT qPCR. TL1A mRNA was upregulated after TCR stimulation but with delayed kinetics compared with DC. Interestingly TL1A upregulation was specifically dependent on DR3 expression as DR3 deficient T cells showed dramatically reduced TL1A induction but normal upregulation of IL 2 mRNA after activation . Taken together these data show that T cells can produce TL1A that acts in an autocrine manner to sustain its own expression but T cell derived TL1A is not necessary for proliferation or cytokine production by isolated T cells.

To study the role of TL1A DR3 interactions in a more physiological model of T cell activation DR3 deficient mice were backcrossed to the Ovalbumin Ova specific TCR transgenic line OT II and cultured na ve T cells from DR3 KO OT II and OT II control mice with Ova peptide and wild type bone marrow derived DC. Under these conditions proliferation of DR3 KO OT II cells was diminished especially at low concentrations of Ova . The cytokine profile of T cells stimulated with Ova peptide and DC is characteristically dependent on the dose of antigen with higher doses favoring IFN production and lower doses favoring IL 4 production Tao et al. 1997 . DR3 KO OT II cells produced less IL 2 at lower doses of Ova and lower amounts of IL 4 at all doses of Ova tested. By contrast production of IFN was higher than controls at all doses tested . Analysis of T cell activation marker expression revealed that optimal upregulation of CD25 and CD71 was also DR3 dependent at low doses of Ova peptide . These data indicate that during interactions between T cells and dendritic cells presenting cognate antigen TL1A DR3 interactions function to costimulate T cell proliferation and production of IL 2 IL 4 but not IFN . These alterations in cytokine production and proliferation in the absence of DR3 may influence T cell polarization. To test this na ve CD4 T cells from DR3 KO or control mice were activated in the presence of dendritic cells under conditions optimized for differentiation of Th1 Th2 or Th17 effector T cells or under neutral conditions and was cytokine production measured after restimulation . In the absence of exogenous polarizing stimuli DR3 KO T cells exhibited mild skewing towards a Th1 IFN secreting profile expected on the C57BL 6 background. In addition appropriate cytokines polarized DR3 KO cells normally towards IL 4 IFN or IL 17 producing cells cultures of DR3 KO OT II and control OT II T cells stimulated with DC and Ova were then set up and polarized with cytokines or Soluble Tachyzoite Antigen STAg which in addition to IL 12 induces TL1A production. These conditions also resulted in normal Th1 skewing by antigen specific DR3 KO T cells . Induction of the transcription factors T bet GATA 3 or ROR by appropriate differentiation stimuli was also unaffected in DR3 KO purified T cells. Thus DR3 appears to be dispensable for the differentiation of na ve T cells into Th1 Th2 or Th17 effector cell subtypes.

c. DR3 is Dispensable for Primary Systemic T Cell Responses but Essential for Immunopathology in Animal Models of T Cell Mediated Disease

To determine the role of DR3 in T cell differentiation and effector function in the intact immune system disease models dependent on distinct T cell subsets were studied in DR3 KO mice. A Th2 dependent model of lung inflammation in which mice are primed systemically with Ova and Alum was first investigated and then locally challenged with Ova Gavett et al. 1994 . In three independent experiments histological analysis showed that the airways in DR3 KO mice lung had less inflammation including mucin production and peribronchial inflammation . Standardized histopathology scores and cell counts in BAL were reduced in OVA sensitized and challenged DR3 KO mice compared with DR3 WT mice sensitized and challenged in parallel with OVA . Percentages of CD3 and CD4 T cells invariant Val4 positive T cells that recognize glycosphingolipid CD1d tetramers and eosinophils were all significantly reduced in lung cell preparations from Ova sensitized and challenged DR3 KO mice compared with controls . Localization of CD3 cells in lung tissue from Ova sensitized DR3 deficient mice by immunohistochemistry revealed fewer interstitial and peribronchial T cells compared with controls and increased perivascular localization suggesting a migration or survival defect of T cells in the lung. Similar increases in perivascular infiltrates were observed for macrophages . Levels of mRNA for IL 5 and IL 13 which are critical for Th2 mediated lung pathology were markedly reduced in DR3 KO Ova sensitized lungs while IL 10 and IFN were equally produced . By contrast when DR3 KO spleen cells from these mice were restimulated with Ova there was normal production of IL 5 and IL 13 indicating that systemic priming of Ova specific Th2 T cells was independent of DR3 . In addition DR3 KO splenocytes proliferated normally in response to Ova. Systemic Th2 function as assessed by the production of Ova specific IgG1 and Ova specific IgE after Ova priming was also normal in DR3 KO mice . Thus in this model of Th2 mediated lung inflammation DR3 is required for Th2 effector cells to accumulate at the site of inflammation but not for systemic differentiation of Th2 T cells. Decreased T cells in the lung may result in defective recruitment of eosinophils and iNKT cells to the site of inflammation as was observed in the DR3 KO lung.

To determine whether DR3 is required for diseases mediated by other T cell subsets Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis EAE a Th17 and Th1 dependent autoimmune disease was studied in DR3 KO mice. In four separate experiments DR3 KO mice exhibited delayed and dramatically reduced paralysis as measured by clinical scores . Despite resistance to EAE T cells from draining lymph nodes of MOG primed DR3 KO mice proliferated normally in response to MOG . The percentage of CD4 T cells in the spinal cord homogenates was markedly reduced in DR3 KO mice . Within the T cell gate the percentage of IFN producing cells was also reduced by two fold in T cells from the spinal cords of DR3 KO mice . The percentage of IL 17 producing cells was normal in DR3 KO mice within this gate but overall was still reduced due to the decreased percentage of CD4 T cells in the spinal cord. To examine the absolute levels of these cytokines in the inflamed spinal cord mRNA for IL 17 and IFN was measured by RT qPCR in spinal cord homogenates. Both cytokines were reduced in spinal cord preparations from MOG primed DR3 KO mice when normalized to the housekeeping gene 2 microglobulin with IFN being the most affected. However when normalized to the expression of the T cell specific gene CD3 6 IL 17 and IFN mRNA expression were not reduced in DR3 KO spinal cord. . Thus DR3 is also critical in this model of autoimmune demyelinating disease associated with a different set of cytokines than the Ova induced lung inflammation model and resistance to disease in DR3 KO mice correlated with decreased numbers of effector T cells in the target organ.

In addition to their role in autoimmune diseases effector T cells are important in controlling infections. It was decided to further investigate the role of DR3 signaling in toxoplasmosis an infection in which IFN secreting Th1 cells are necessary for mice to survive acute infection. After infection with DR3 KO as well as control mice had 100 survival for seven weeks. Spleen cells isolated from DR3 KO infected mice at seven weeks post infection and stimulated with STAg produced comparable amounts of TNF IFN and IL 10 compared with controls . These data indicate that the priming and maintenance of effector Th1 cells in response to is not dependent on DR3.

On day 3 the cells were pulsed with H thymidine for 6 h and then harvested and counted on a scintillation counter.

On days 0 and 7 mice were sensitized systemically via a 200 l intraperitoneal i.p. injection containing either 100 g Chicken Ova Sigma or PBS emulsified in an equal volume mixture with alum Pierce Laboratories Rockford Ill. . For assessment of pulmonary inflammation mice were challenged with 100 g Ova or PBS 30 l inoculum intratracheally i.t. on day 14 and intranasally i.n. on day 15. Mice were euthanized 48 72 h after the final challenge to evaluate cell infiltration cellular inflammation in the lung and cytokine levels in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF . BAL fluid was obtained by direct cannulation of the lungs with a 20 gauge intravenous catheter and lavage with 500 l 1 fetal bovine serum FBS in PBS for cytokine analysis and with 750 l 1 FBS in PBS for analysis of cellular infiltration . Samples for cytokine analysis were stored at 80 C. Samples for cellular analysis were prepared as a cytospin Thermo Shandon Pittsburgh Pa. for differential cellular analysis after staining with Kwik diff Thermo Shandon and a portion was used to determine total cell counts. Lung histology was scored by a reader with experimental conditions masked as described previously McConchie et al. 2006 

Detection of IFN IL 4 and IL 17 producing cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining using anti IFN APC anti IL 4 PE anti IL 17 PE BD Biosciences . Briefly cells were stimulated for five hours with anti CD3 and anti CD28 or phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin with monensin added after two hours. Cells were fixed in 3 paraformaldehyde permeabilized in 0.1 saponin and analyzed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer Becton Dickinson . Cytokine production in cell culture supernatants was analyzed by Cytometric Bead Array BD Biosciences . Serum immunoglobulins were measured by ELISA following the manufacturer s instructions Bethyl Labs and OVA specific IgG1 and IgE were measured by IgG1 or IgE specific ELISA using plates coated with 50 l OVA 100 g ml .

Bone marrow derived DC or splenic CD11c DC from C57BL 6 mice and the indicated knock out mice were cultured and stimulated for the indicated time with or without 100 ng ml LPS 20 g ml SEA or 10 g ml STAg. Stimulation with Ig cross linking was performed by coating plates with 0.5 mg ml mouse IgG Jackson Immunoresearch for 1 h at 37 C. followed by 50 g ml sheep anti mouse IgG Jackson Immunoresearch for 1 h at 37 C. Purified T cells were stimulated with 5 g ml anti CD3 and anti CD28 for the indicated time.

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TriZOL and the pure Link Micro to midi kit Invitrogen . Quantitative RT PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system using SuperScript One Step RT PCR System Invitrogen . Pre designed Primer probe sets were from Applied Biosystems with the exception of TL1A which was detected with primers designed to recognize full length TL1A forward CCCCGGAAAAGACTGTATGC reverse GGTGAGTAAACTTGCTGTGGTGAA probe TCGGGCCATAACAGAAGAGAGATCTGAGC . Probes specific for 2 microglobulin or CD3 were used as internal controls.

To evaluate the function of TL1A transgenic mice were generated in which TL1A is constitutively expressed on dendritic cells and T cells. For T cells an improved version of the human CD2 enhancer construct Zhumabekov T. et al. 1995 was used and for dendritic cell specific expression a CD11c promoter construct was used Brocker T. et al. 1997 . An Influenza Hemagglutinin HA epitope tag was added to the N terminus of the TL1A cDNA for identification of transgene derived TL1A mRNA and protein. Transgene expression was assessed in each founder line of transgenic mice. For the CD2 TL1A construct four lines R1 R6 U8 and Z9 had similar detectable levels of TL1A expression in the spleen and lymph node T cells assayed by intracellular flow cytometry for the HA tag in T cells gated on CD3 with no HA staining detected in other immune cell subsets and were used in subsequent analysis. For the CD11c TL1A transgenic mice there was a wider range of expression. Transgene expression relative to endogenous TL1A ranged from 2 to over 500 fold and founders were divided into high and low expressers based on a cutoff of 8 fold overexpression. Increased numbers of CD69 T cells were present in spleen and lymph nodes from both CD2 and CD11c TL1A transgenic lines. Spontaneous T cell activation was more prominent in CD4 than CD8 T cell subsets. These results indicate that deregulation of TL1A in either T cells or DC results in spontaneous T cell activation and disruption of T cell homeostasis.

On further inspection of transgenic mice from both CD11c TL1A and CD2 TL1A lines frequent bowel edema and evidence of bowel wall thickening throughout the small bowel were observed. Incidence of these features was virtually 100 in the four lines of CD2 TL1A transgenic mice under study and correlated with the level of transgene expression in the CD11c TL1A lines. Bowel wall thickening inflammatory infiltrates goblet cell hyperplasia enlargement of villi and distortion of normal architecture can be seen . These changes were quantitated by an experienced observer blinded to the status of the mice according to a scoring scheme developed for TNBS colitis that encompasses inflammatory cell infiltrates elongation and destruction of villi crypt abscesses and thickening of the muscularis layers Neurath M. et al. 2000 . The terminal ileum was most prominently involved on both gross inspection and histopathology in both CD11c and CD2 TL1A transgenic mice with the colon relatively spared C . Intestinal inflammation was associated with weight loss in these mice again dependent on the level of transgene expression .

These observations establish TL1A transgenic mice as a new animal model of inflammatory bowel disease with some features strikingly similar to human Crohn s disease including transmural inflammation and a predilection for the terminal ileum. Interestingly a number of recent reports describe increased expression of TL1A and DR3 in the lamina propria of biopsy specimens of patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease. Increased TL1A and DR3 expression was also noted in two other animal models of IBD the SAMP1 YitFc and TNFstrains Bamias G. et al. 2003 Bamias G. et al. 2006 . Taken together with the discovery that deregulated TL1A expression provokes spontaneous IBD in transgenic mice TL1A DR3 interactions can be important in the pathogenesis of IBD and constitute a promising therapeutic target in IBD and related inflammatory diseases with a T cell component including Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies are carried out on tissue sections from selected CD2 TL1A and CD11c TL1A transgenic mice. Initial studies localize T cells with anti CD3 and macrophages with F4 80 by immunostaining frozen sections of intestine from TL1A transgenic mice. FACS analysis is performed on intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocyte preparations from involved areas of bowel from TL1A transgenic mice. and NKT cells are enumerated along with NK cells and B cells and activation status is examined with CD25 CD69 and CD71 surface markers. FoxP3 CD25 Tregs are also enumerated in these samples to determine whether there is an attempt at immune counter regulation through Treg as has been seen in other models of T cell driven immunopathology Tang Q. et al. 2006 . Although T cells are the main cell type expressing the TL1A receptor DR3 TL1A expression has been found in NKT cells NK cells and B cells. Thus enforced TL1A can expand other immune cell subsets that could mediate IBD in these mice. To determine which lymphocyte subsets are required for TL1A driven colitis TL1A transgenic mice are crossed to various lines of knockout mice which lack different lymphocyte subpopulations. TL1A transgenic mice are first crossed to RAG deficient mice to determine dependency on T B and NKT cells. If these mice lack inflammatory bowel disease then the dependence of TL1A driven IBD has been shown on the adaptive immune system. Other crosses are then performed to determine the requirement for T cells TCR alpha knockout NKT cells CD1d knockout NK cells IL 15 knockout and B cells IgH knockout mice. If T cells are found to be required for IBD in TL1A transgenic mice then the contribution of different T cell subsets can be examined through crossing CD2 TL1A transgenic mice to Class I or Class II MHC deficient mice which lack CD8 and CD4 T cells respectively. If T cells are implicated IBD could result from non antigen specific costimulation by TL1A or alternatively specific T cell reactivates i.e. to gut derived antigens could be required for disease induction. To test this TL1A mice are crossed with TCR transgenic mice bearing irrelevant specificities such as OT II ovalbumin specific TCR transgenic mice. If autoreactive or gut flora reactive T cells are necessary for TL1A driven IBD then these TCR transgenes can ameliorate disease.

Inflammatory bowel disease models have been found to depend on a wide variety of different cytokines Strober W. et al. 2007 . Initially interest focused on interferon and IL 12 and indeed antibodies against the p40 subunit of IL 12 are effective in human inflammatory bowel disease and mouse IBD models. More recently it has been discovered that p40 is a component of IL 23 an IL 12 family cytokine that has been shown to be critical in inflammatory bowel disease. IL 23 acts at least in part through enhancing the differentiation and or survival of T cells producing IL 17 a cytokine that potently attracts and activates neutrophils and monocytes Fuss U. et al. 2006 Hue S. et al. 2006 McKenzie B. S. et al. 2006 . Experiments have been conducted to determine the predominant cytokines expressed in TL1A induced IBD to determine which effector cell populations are critical in this disease and to better understand the effects of chronic TL1A stimulation. Quantitation of cytokines from RNA extracted from ileum and other regions of the intestines in TL1A transgenic mice revealed consistent elevation of IL 17 and IL 13 . Interestingly IL 22 another cytokine produced by the Th17 subset of T cells was not detectable and IFN the characteristic product of Th1 cells was also not elevated over controls. Examination of T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed that IL 17 producing T cells were the most elevated over controls compared with IFN and IL 4. Blocking anti cytokine antibodies or knockout mice in genes known to be critical for development of particular T cell subset e.g. IL 17 STAT4 STATE ROR can then be used to determine which of the cytokines and Th cell subsets are required for the development of TL1A driven IBD.

iii. Determination of Whether TL1A Blocks Regulatory T Cell Function or Renders T Cells Resistant to Treg.

Whether TL1A affects the generation or function of natural Tregs is not known. In rheumatoid arthritis the related cytokine TNF was shown to impair the function of FOXP3 regulatory T cells independent of their numbers Nadkarni S. et al. 2007 Valencia X. et al. 2006 . FOXP3 positive Tregs are present in normal numbers in DR3 knockout mice and interestingly are present in increased numbers in the mesenteric lymph nodes of TL1A transgenic mice. To aid in the isolation of Tregs from TL1A transgenic mice which have increased numbers of activated CD25 T cells selected lines of TL1A transgenic mice are crossed with FOXP3 GFP reporter mice to make sure that only FOXP3 positive Tregs are studied in these experiments. Tregs isolated from TL1A transgenic mice are assayed for their function and it also is tested whether TL1A can block the suppressive function of normal Tregs through the use of CD2 TL1A transgenic responder cells Tresp and the addition of TL1A to Treg Tresp cultures. In vivo assays of Treg function are also performed in which Tregs are transferred with na ve CD45RB hi cells into immunodeficient hosts Powrie F. et al. 1993 . Reciprocal experiments are carried out with either Treg or na ve T cells derived from CD2 TL1A transgenic mice to determine whether Treg function or the ability of na ve T cells to cause IBD is influenced by TL1A.

It is also determined whether DR3 is required for the development of colitis in the absence of transgene derived TL1A. The colitis induced by intrarectal administration of the hapten TNBS has been extensively characterized. It is known that colitis requires T cells and is also dependent on TNF and IL 12p40 Neurath M. et al. 2000 Neurath M. F. et al. 1997 . Recent evidence has also implicated the IL 23 target cytokine IL 17 in pathogenesis of this experimental disease Zhang Z. et al. 2006 . Resistance to EAE and Ova induced asthma indicates that DR3 deficient mice can be resistant to TNBS colitis compared with littermate controls. To do these experiments DR3 KO mice are backcrossed onto the susceptible C57Bl 10 strain. Alternatively while backcrossing is in progress susceptible mice are treated with TL1A blocking antibodies prior to or after induction of TNBS colitis. DR3 deficient T cells are also transferred into immunodeficient hosts in the transfer model of colitis to determine if DR3 on T cells is necessary in this model of colitis.

TL1A has been detected in rheumatoid synovium. We used novel monoclonal antibodies against human TL1A to determine the factors that induce TL1A and the specificity of elevated TL1A levels in the synovial fluid SF or blood for RA versus other rheumatic diseases. In the mouse collagen induced arthritis CIA model we blocked TL1A DR3 interactions with neutralizing antibodies against TL1A and measured the effects of TL1A blockade on anti collagen antibodies clinical joint inflammation and erosions by micro CT. TL1A was induced by Fc receptor crosslinking and to a lesser extent by plasma membrane TLR in human monocytes. Significantly higher blood and SF levels of TL1A were seen in patients with RA compared to other rheumatic diseases. Plasma TL1A was predictive of SF TL1A levels. However SF TL1A was elevated independently of TNF and disease activity in RA patients. TL1A blockade was efficacious in reducing clinical joint scores in CIA and dramatically reduced bone erosions independently of effects on paw swelling. TL1A is important in both human and mouse autoimmune arthritis especially in the pathogenesis of erosions. We disclose TL1A blockade as a potent disease modifying treatment for RA that acts independently of TNF.

Elutriated monocytes from normal donors were obtained from the NIH transfusion medicine department under NIH IRB approved clinical protocols. Monocytes were cultured at 1 10cells ml in RPMI medium with 10 FCS in a 37 C. 5 COincubator.

LPS Ultrapure Minnesota R595 List Biological Laboratories inc. Campbell Calif. was added at the indicated concentrations. Stimulation with immune complexes was performed as previously described. Quantitative RT PCR was performed with the use of an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system with qScript One Step qRT PCR Kit Low ROX Quanta BioSciences Inc. . Predesigned primer probe sets were from Applied Biosystems and the sequences designed to detect full length TL1A are forward 5 CCCCGGAAAAGACTGTATGC 3 reverse 5 GGTGAGTAAACTTGCTGTGGTGAA 3 probe 5 TCGGGCCATAACAGAAGAGAGATCTGAGC 3 . Each measurement was normalized to expression of 2 microglobulin delta Ct . 2 CT was then used as the level of gene expression. Gene expression levels were normalized to the level present in un stimulated cells.

A commercially available human TL1A ELISA kit PeproTech cat no. 900 K290 was used to measure TL1A in cell culture supernatants. For measuring human TL1A in matching plasma and synovial fluid samples ELISA was performed as follows 96 well flat bottom plates were coated with 1 g mL mouse anti human TL1A clone 1A9 in PBS overnight at 4 C. Plates were blocked with blocking buffer 5 BSA 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS for 1 hour. 25 L of sample diluted 10 fold with 225 L sample diluent 1 BSA 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS were loaded into each well and the plates were incubated for two hours at 37 C. TL1A was detected by polyclonal biotinylated rabbit anti human TL1A Ab followed by Steptavidin Horseradish peroxidase SA HRP 0.5 g mL for one hour at 37 C.

Male DBA 1J mice 8 10 weeks old obtained from the Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. were injected intradermally with 100 g chicken collagen type II CII in complete Freund s adjuvant 1 1 w v to the tail base at day 0 and boosted with an intradermal injection of 100 g CII in incomplete Freund s adjuvant 1 1 w v on day 21. The mice were then randomized at day 21 to receive either control or treatment. Mice in the treatment group were injected i.p. with 20 mg kg hamster anti mouse TL1A antibody clone 5G4.6 every seven days starting on day 21. Control group mice received 20 mg kg hamster immunoglobulin. Mice were euthanized at day 49. Hind legs were cut above the knees and were fixed in 10 formaldehyde. Animals were used under protocols approved by the NIAMS ACUC.

The development of arthritis was evaluated by macroscopic scoring of each paw on a 0 4 scale previously described. Scoring was done by two separate investigators blinded to the randomization and the average score of each mouse was used.

96 well flat bottom plates were coated with 100 L 50 g mL chicken collagen dissolved in 0.05M TRIS 0.2M NaCl overnight at 4 C. Plates were blocked with 200 L blocking buffer 1 BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. 50 L of samples of 5 fold serially diluted serum from 1 100 to 1 12500 with sample diluent 1 BSA 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS were loaded in duplicate wells and the plates were incubated for two hours at room temperature.

Legs from CIA experiments were stored in 10 formaldehyde until they were scanned. Micro CT of mouse anatomy was performed with a SkyScan 1172 Micro Xray CT scanner MicroPhotonics Inc. Allentown Pa. USA SkyScan Kontich Belgium with the x ray source focal spot size 4 micrometers energy range 20 100 kV biased at 44 kV 22 microamps and with a 0.5 mm aluminum filter to reduce beam hardening. The images were acquired with a voxel size of 12.17 micrometers with the camera to source distance of 220 mm and an object to source distance of 116 mm. 450 projections were acquired with an angular resolution of 0.4 degrees through 180 degrees rotation. 8 frames were averaged for each projection radiograph with an exposure time of 295 ms per frame. The scan duration was approximately 40 minutes. Tomographic images were reconstructed using vendor supplied software based on the Feldkamp cone beam algorithm. Reconstructed images were then made into three dimensional image using CTAn v.1.10 then visualized using CTVol v.2.1 SkyScan . Three dimensional images were scored on de identified 3 D reconstructions by two separate investigators based on the scoring system described.

Fc receptor FcR cross linking and TLR ligands induce TL1A expression in human monocytes. In RA FcR cross linking by immune complexes and stimulation of TLRs by endogenous ligands may sustain inflammation by stimulating monocytes and other innate immune cells in the joint. Accordingly we tested the ability of immune complexes and TLR ligands to induce expression of TL1A by human monocytes. Both FcR cross linking and LPS induced TL1A at the mRNA level with levels peaking at 18 hours and then rapidly declining consistent with degradation of TL1A RNA governed by AU rich elements present in the 3 untranslated region of the TL1A mRNA. The peak of TL1A induction was 6 fold higher following FcR cross linking than following optimal concentrations of LPS. At the protein level FcR cross linking induced higher levels of TL1A that were detectable at 18 hours whereas LPS induced TL1A was only detectable at 48 hours with TL1A production approximately 10 fold lower with optimal doses of LPS than with FcR cross linking. TLRs can be divided into subclasses depending on whether they activate signaling pathways linked to the adaptor protein MyD88 TRIF or both. To determine which of these signaling pathways are important in induction of TL1A expression we stimulated human monocytes with a panel of TLR ligands specific for each receptor. Stimulation through TLR1 2 4 and 6 was the most efficient at inducing TL1A TLR 5 and 9 were intermediate and stimulation through TLR 3 7 and 8 had no effect on TL1A production. These results are consistent with MyD88 dependent rapid NF kB upregulation being important in TL1A induction since TLR 3 7 and 8 poorly activate MyD88. These results are also consistent with those obtained with murine DC in which TL1A production in response to LPS is primarily dependent on MyD88.

Given the potent ability of immune complexes to promote TL1A production in vitro we reasoned that this cytokine may be preferentially elevated in RA in which rheumatoid factor RF and other immune complexes stimulate innate immune cells. To that end we measured TL1A levels in matched samples of plasma and SF from a cohort of patients with RA 39 samples from 31 patients or other types of arthritis 37 samples from 31 patients including psoriatic arthritis crystal induced arthritis reactive arthritis osteoarthritis non specific inflammatory arthritis juvenile inflammatory arthritis or infectious arthritis. The majority 27 of 39 of SF samples from RA patients had TL1A levels above 0.1 ng mL with a mean of 0.59 ng mL and up to 3.25 ng mL detected. By contrast only 2 of 37 non RA samples one each from a patient with reactive arthritis and a patient with psoriatic arthritis contained more than 0.1 ng mL TL1A. In plasma a smaller but still significant percentage of RA patients had elevated TL1A levels while no samples from patients with other arthritides had detectable TL1A levels. Five RA and five non RA patients contributed more than one sample to this cohort. In SF TL1A levels fluctuated depending on the day of SF collection. In plasma however TL1A levels of patients with repeated measurements remained fairly constant either highly elevated 2 ng mL or below 0.1 ng ml. This likely reflects the variability in inflammation between involved joints among patients subjected to repeated synovial aspirations. Elevated TL1A correlated more with markers such as anti CCP that predict more severe disease and erosions than with disease activity at the time of sample collection. Among RA patients tested for anti CCP antibodies those with a positive anti CCP n 15 had significantly higher level of TL1A in SF p 0.039 and a trend toward higher TL1A in plasma p 0.129 than in those without n 4 . Comparing TL1A level in SF and plasma between RA patients with or without RF was not feasible because most of the patients in this cohort were sero positive. Still sero negative patients n 2 had mostly undetectable TL1A in both SF and plasma suggesting that TL1A may be preferentially elevated in patients with RF. However the quantitative level of RF or anti CCP did not correlate with TL1A levels in plasma or SF. In addition TL1A levels in SF or plasma did not correlate with measures of clinical severity including DAS 28 score ESR CRP or tender swollen joint counts nor did SF TL1A levels correlate with SF WBC counts. There was a trend toward higher TL1A n 9 in both SF mean 0.68 ng mL in erosive vs 0.55 ng mL in non erosive and in plasma mean 1.09 ng mL in erosive vs 0.25 ng mL in non erosive . Of note there was a linear correlation between plasma and SF TL1A levels in 39 matched RA plasma and SF samples R2 0.52 p

Blocking TL1A DR3 interactions improves clinical outcome and bony erosions in CIA. Previous studies have found a beneficial effect of TL1A in murine CIA but the effects of TL1A blockade on bony erosions have not been quantitated. To these ends we administered an antagonistic anti TL1A monoclonal antibody to DBA 1 mice at the time of boosting with antigen in CIA. Significant reductions in total joint scores were observed for the ensuing 28 days particularly at earlier time points. The onset of measurable clinical signs of arthritis was significantly delayed by anti TL1A mAb. Interestingly the decrease in the clinical severity in mice treated with anti TL1A was not associated with decreases in titers of anti collagen antibodies. Taken together these data show that blocking TL1A DR3 interactions potently reduces the clinical inflammatory signs of CIA without affecting systemic immune responses against the collagen immunogen. Since blocking TL1A DR3 interactions clearly improved the clinical severity of CIA we assessed whether these treatments also prevented bone erosions. We used micro computed tomography micro CT to provide a quantitative and global assessment of erosions. Anti TL1A treatment dramatically reduced erosions in the hind paws of mice induced to develop CIA. Quantitation of erosions in hind paws according to a scoring system that takes account of peri articular erosions and deformities in each joint in the hind paws showed a significant reduction in average and maximum erosion scores in TL1A treated mice. The reduction was especially pronounced in the MTP joints p 0.042 and in toes p 0.015 . Also generalized deformity occurred in only the control group 20 versus 0 in the treatment group . Strikingly erosions in anti TL1A treated mice were significantly reduced in paws with similar maximum clinical scores 2 way ANOVA p
