The present invention relates to a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes which is usable as a transparent conductive film or a conductive film on electrodes for panels such as liquid crystal display panels and plasma display panels electrodes for display elements such as laptop computers mobile phones and touch panels or electrodes and electrode substrates for lithium ion batteries lithium ion capacitors fuel cells thin film solar cells other primary batteries and secondary batteries and sheets for efficiently releasing heat generated inside various devices and a novel method for producing the same.

Transparent conductive films transparent electrodes produced by coating a glass substrate and a PET polyethylene terephthalate resin film with ITO indium tin oxide by sputtering vacuum deposition or the like have been used so far. However indium contained in ITO is a rare earth and there is uneasiness at procurement thereof and there is a fear that dusts of ITO generated at a production site may cause injuries to health. Therefore alternatives thereof are actively under research and development. Graphenes are expected as a promising candidate but have not yet put into practical use because they could not be produced stably in an industrial scale.

In lithium ion batteries capacitors lithium ion capacitors and fuel cells film like electrodes which are produced by mixing fine powders of graphite carbon black or the like with polyvinylidene fluoride and a solvent to form a slurry and coating and drying the slurry on a current collector such as a copper foil have been put into practical use. For example film like electrodes which are produced by using a copper foil and artificial graphite and natural graphite as main materials have been put into practical use on negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Such lithium ion batteries are put into practical use as batteries for driving of electric vehicles and are under active research and development since improvement of energy efficiency and increase in a cruising distance per one charge are required.

Graphite is an active material for producing charging and discharging by an intercalation reaction of a lithium ion but it is difficult to form graphite alone into a sheet since graphite is a powder. For that reason graphite is adhered together with a binder such as polyvinylidene fluoride to a copper foil or the like to be formed into a sheet. Though there is a graphite sheet material formed into a sheet using graphite alone mechanical strength thereof is very low in its bending direction and pulling direction and therefore use of such a material is limited to a heat resistant packing etc. in which a compressive strength is important.

Multi layer graphenes are promising as negative electrodes of lithium ion batteries and electrodes of lithium ion capacitors because they produce intercalation of lithium ion like graphite. For example if graphene film can be formed directly on a copper foil electric resistance which is a problem in use of a binder component can be decreased and in addition an electrode layer can be made thinner and a charge and discharge capacity is increased. Further if graphene film can be formed directly on a resin film or graphene can be formed into a complex with a resin film an electrode can be formed without using a copper foil. In lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles making a weight thereof light is required but a specific gravity of copper is as heavy as approximately 9 g cm. Meanwhile if a graphene film can be formed on a PET resin film or a composite of graphene with a PET resin can be produced a specific gravity thereof is decreased to less than 2 g cm which can lead to decrease in weight to a large extent.

There are a CVD method an SiC thermal decomposition method a graphene oxide reducing method etc. as a technology for producing graphenc on a substrate. However each of them has respective problems. Therefore a method for producing more easily and stably is demanded.

For example a CVD method is such that a film comprising graphene is formed on one surface of a metal foil such as copper or nickel by chemical vapor deposition CVD then after laminating a resin film on the graphene film the metal foil is removed by etching and the graphene film is transferred from the etched surface onto an end substrate of PET resin or the like Non patent Documents 1 to 4 . However in such a method since a composite material in which a graphene film is strongly bonded to a metal foil due to a catalytic action of the metal foil is produced in order to transfer the film once formed on the metal foil to a substrate all metal foil need to be removed using an acid which makes a production process complicated and results in a problem such as a fear of causing a defect on the film in a transferring process.

Further the SiC thermal decomposition method is a method for heating an SiC substrate to around 1300 C. to remove Si from its surface and recombine the remaining C into graphene autonomously Non patent Document 5 . However there is a problem such that the SiC substrate to be used is expensive and transferring from the SiC substrate is difficult.

Furthermore the graphene oxide reducing method is a method for oxidizing a graphite powder dissolving the oxidized graphene powder in a solution applying the solution to a substrate and then reducing the oxidized graphene Non patent Documents 6 and 7 . However since a reducing process is necessary and it is difficult to complete the reduction there is a problem such that it is difficult to secure enough electric conductivity and transparency.

In the light of the above mentioned background an object of the present invention is to provide a method being capable of providing a transparent conductive film and a conductive film which comprise graphenes more simply and stably.

Further the present invention provides a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes obtained by laminating on surface of a substrate multi layer graphenes from a mass of multi layer graphenes.

The inventors of the present invention have made intensive studies and as a result have found that a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes being useful as a transparent conductive film and a conductive film can be produced simply and stably by laminating multi layer graphenes directly on surface of a substrate using a mass of multi layer graphenes formed by aggregation of many multi layer graphenes. Then further studies have been made to complete the present invention.

Accordingly the production method of the present invention makes it possible to provide an inexpensive transparent conductive film conductive film and heat releasing sheet efficiently.

In the present invention the mass of multi layer graphenes is one resulting from aggregation of many multi layer graphenes without being laminated to each other and it does not matter whatever shape embodiment and size the mass has. Examples thereof are A the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained by aggregation of multi layer graphenes extending from the inside toward the outside This mass can be in the form of isotropic graphite particle and in the form of bulk like graphite structure. A size of the graphite particle is from about 1 m to about 1000 m and a diameter or a width of multi layer graphenes constituting the graphite particle is from about 0.1 m to about 500 m and a thickness thereof is from about 0.34 nm to about 100 nm preferably from about 0.34 nm to about 10 nm more preferably from about 0.34 nm to about 3.5 nm. This mass is hereinafter referred to as a cluster of multi layer graphenes B the mass of multi layer graphenes in the film like form in which each of multi layer graphenes is in a state of being grown in the direction of a axis of the graphite crystal approximately vertically to a plane or a spherical surface and such multi layer graphenes cover the plane surface and the spherical surface to be in a film like form a diameter or a width of the multi layer graphenes constituting the mass is from about 1 m to about 500 m and a thickness thereof is from about 0.34 nm to about 100 nm preferably from about 0.34 nm to about 10 nm more preferably from about 0.34 nm to about 3.5 nm. This mass is hereinafter referred to simply as a film like mass of multi layer graphenes C the fibrous mass of multi layer graphenes in which multi layer graphenes are in a state of being grown from the center toward the outside of the fiber in the direction of a axis of the graphite crystal and many of such multi layer graphenes are connected to form a fibrous mass This mass is in the fibrous foil having a diameter of from 1 to 500 m and a length of from 0.01 to 30 mm. A diameter of the multi layer graphenes constituting the mass of multi layer graphenes is from 0.1 to 500 m and a thickness thereof is from 1 to 100 nm. This mass is hereinafter referred to simply as a fibrous mass of multi layer graphenes D a cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained by subjecting the multi layer graphenes constituting the above A to partial cleaving A thickness of the multi layer graphenes is from about 0.34 nm to about 9 nm. This mass is hereinafter referred to simply as a cluster of cloven multi layer graphenes and the like.

The multi layer graphenes constituting the mass of multi layer graphenes can contain single layer graphenes. Further the multi layer graphenes are those having the above mentioned size and thickness particularly are multi layer graphene pieces . Furthermore other preferred examples of the multi layer graphenes are several layer graphenes Few layer graphene Multi layer graphenes up to about ten layers having a thickness of from about 0.34 nm to about 3.1 nm .

Among those masses of multi layer graphenes example of the method for producing A the cluster of multi layer graphenes is a production method comprising preparing a powdery and or particulate material of an organic compound pre baked to an extent of containing remaining hydrogen charging the powdery and or particulate material in a closed vessel made of a heat resistant material and subjecting the powdery and or particulate material together with the vessel to hot isostatic pressing treatment using a compressed gas atmosphere wherein a maximum ultimate temperature in the hot isostatic pressing treatment is 900 C. or more and lower than 2000 C. This production method is explained below.

The closed vessel made of heat resistant material for example crucible made of graphite functions as a reaction vessel for causing the CVD reaction with gases such as hydrogen hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and water generated from the pre baked starting material during the HIP treatment. Since it is necessary to cause a chemical reaction without scattering the generated reaction gas outside the vessel while keeping isotropic high pressure by a gas pressure the material of the vessel and the sealing structure thereof are properly selected. If the material is too dense a difference in pressure between the inside and the outside of the vessel for example graphite crucible arises which results in an explosive breakdown of the vessel. On the other hand if the material is too porous the reaction gas generated inside the vessel is scattered outside the vessel for example graphite crucible and efficiency of the chemical reaction is lowered.

The material and structure of the vessel for example graphite crucible are properly selected in consideration of necessity of taking a HIP treated product out of the vessel sealing the vessel for example crucible as easily as possible in view of facilitating charging of the starting material before the HIP treatment exposure to high temperature of about 900 C. or more during the HIP treatment and maintaining strength of the vessel at high temperature so as to be capable of withstanding the inside pressure caused by generation of the reaction gas from the pre baked starting material.

Examples of the heat resistant materials constituting the reaction vessel are graphite and in addition ceramics such as alumina magnesia and zirconia and metals such as iron nickel zirconium and platinum. Graphite material is suitable as a material for the vessel for example crucible . The graphite vessel can be made using artificial graphite materials specifically prepared by extrusion molding CIP molding squeeze molding vibration molding or rammer molding hard carbon materials including glassy carbon prepared mainly by molding a thermosetting resin carbon fiber reinforced carbon materials or composite materials thereof. The porosity of the graphite material is important for efficiently causing the chemical reaction in the vessel for example crucible and therefore a material having an open pore ratio apparent pore ratio of less than 20 can be used suitably. In the case of a material having an open pore ratio of 20 or more the reaction gases are diffused outside the vessel for example crucible and therefore a concentration of the gases necessary for generating the graphite cannot be kept. However in the case where there is not so large difference between the volume of the vessel for example crucible and the volume of a HIP treating chamber where the vessel is charged even if an open pore ratio of the vessel for example crucible is 20 or more an amount of gases scattering outside the vessel for example crucible is not so large and therefore efficiency is not affected so much.

With respect to the vessel to be used in the present invention a screw capped graphite crucible can be used so that charging of the pre baked starting material in the vessel and discharging of the product after the HIP treatment can be carried out efficiently. The inner wall at the top of the crucible body and the outer circumference of the crucible cap have thread cutting by specified tap processing and thereby the crucible can be sealed by turning the cap to the thread after charging of the pre baked starting material .

By carrying out hot isostatic pressing treatment by covering the whole or a part of the bottom and the top of the pre baked starting material with a spacer made of a hard carbon material having a low open pore ratio in order to increase a degree of sealing of the pre baked starting material scattering of the reaction gases generated from the pre baked starting material from the top and the bottom of the crucible can be controlled. 

Further a reaction efficiency can be increased by carrying out hot isostatic pressing treatment by covering the whole or a part of the side of the pre baked starting material with a sleeve made of a hard carbon material having a low open pore ratio or by covering the whole or a part around the pre baked starting material with a spacer and a sleeve . Examples of the carbon material for the spacer and the sleeve are glassy carbon diamond like carbon amorphous carbon and the like and one of them can be used alone or two or more thereof can be used together. The open pore ratio of the carbon material is usually less than 0.5 . Even if the pre baked starting material is covered with a spacer and a sleeve having an open pore ratio of 0 there is a gap between the spacer and the sleeve. Therefore the pre baked starting material cannot be sealed completely with the spacer and the sleeve.

Examples of a screw of a screw capped graphite crucible are a triangular screw having a cross section of screw thread in the form like equilateral triangle a square screw a trapezoid screw and the like and among these a triangular screw is preferred.

In the process for generating vapor phase grown graphite by HIP treatment using the pre baked starting material containing remaining hydrogen irrespective of kind of a starting material to be used a degree of crystallinity and a true density of the generated graphite can be controlled by a pre baking temperature an amount of remaining hydrogen in the pre baked starting material a shape of the pre baked starting material a HIP treatment temperature and pressure and temperature and pressure elevating rates.

With respect to an amount of remaining hydrogen from the viewpoint of production of the target product of the present invention there is no problem if the amount is enough for sufficiently generating gases such as hydrogen hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and water which are necessary for the CVD reaction at the time of HIP treatment. The amount is usually about 6500 ppm or more preferably about 10000 ppm or more. The pre baked starting material containing remaining hydrogen can be obtained by pre baking a powdery and or particulate material of an organic compound. In this case usually the amount of the remaining hydrogen changes depending on the pre baking temperature. Namely as the pre baking temperature increases the amount of the remaining hydrogen decreases.

The thus obtained pre baked starting material containing remaining hydrogen is subjected to HIP treatment under the proper conditions. The vapor phase grown graphite can be obtained at a HIP treatment temperature of about 900 C. or more but at too high temperatures for example about 2000 C. the target product is subject to damage by etching with the exciting hydrogen . Therefore in the present invention it is necessary that the maximum ultimate temperature at the HIP treatment is about 900 C. or more and lower than about 2000 C. Further from the viewpoint of efficient production of the target product of the present invention the maximum ultimate temperature at the HIP treatment is within the range from about 1100 C. to about 1900 C. preferably from about 1200 C. to about 1800 C.

A suitable maximum ultimate pressure at the HIP treatment varies with a particle size of the pre baked starting material and the HIP treatment can be suitably carried out at a pressure usually within the range from about 1 MPa to about 300 MPa preferably from about 10 MPa to about 200 MPa preferably from about 30 MPa to about 200 MPa.

In the HIP treatment it is desirable from the viewpoint of production efficiency that usually the pressure is firstly elevated to a specified pressure before the temperature is elevated to approximately the pre baking temperature pressure preceding pattern so that the pre baked starting material is not scattered and then the temperature is elevated to the pre baking temperature and thereafter the temperature and pressure are elevated to the maximum ultimate temperature and the maximum ultimate pressure respectively according to necessity. Example of the specified pressure is about 70 MPa. In the case of a particle size of as small as about 1 m or less the pressure preceding pattern as mentioned above is not necessary particularly and HIP treatment can be carried out efficiently.

The thus obtained cluster of multi layer graphenes as a target product of the present invention has a high degree of crystallinity. In the present invention the true density of the cluster of multi layer graphenes is preferably 1.85 g cmor more more preferably 2.0 g cmor more further preferably 2.1 g cmor more further preferably 2.2 g cmor more. In the case of a large particle size of the pre baked starting material as mentioned infra a production rate of the cluster of multi layer graphenes in the product decreases and therefore when the true density of the product after the HIP treatment is measured as it is there may be a case where the true density is lower than the values mentioned above. However as far as true density of generated cluster of multi layer graphenes of any part is within the range mentioned above the obtained product can be used suitably as the cluster of multi layer graphenes of the present invention. Moreover the total pore ratio of the cluster of multi layer graphenes is preferably 40 or more more preferably 50 or more. Among the above mentioned cluster of multi layer graphenes those satisfying both of the true density and total pore ratio within the mentioned preferred range are preferred as compared with a cluster of multi layer graphenes satisfying either of the true density or the total pore ratio within the mentioned preferred range . Nonlimiting examples of such preferred cluster of multi layer graphenes are those having a true density of 1.85 g cmor more and a total pore ratio of 40 or more and those having a true density of 2.0 g cmor more and a total pore ratio of 50 or more and any other combinations can also be within the scope of the present invention.

A mechanism of generation of multi layer graphenes from the pre baked starting material is shown in . By carrying out HIP treatment of particles of the starting material obtained by pre baking an organic compound gases such as hydrogen hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are generated from the inside of the particles of the pre baked starting material heated to a temperature higher than the pre baking temperature. The gases pass through the pores of the material and reach the surface of the particles of the pre baked starting material. During this process the graphenes are generated physically and chemically by excitation with a temperature and a pressure. The pre baked starting material shrinks as the reaction gases are generated and the graphenes are generated inside and outside of the material.

In the HIP treatment since a pressure is applied with gases such as argon and nitrogen in an isotropic manner as shown in graphenes are grown approximately radially from the surface of the particles of the pre heated starting material to an in plane direction of the graphenes in the direction of a axis of graphite crystal . Further multi layer graphenes are grown in such a manner that the graphenes spread while connecting carbons in the direction of from a starting point of graphene formed at an initial stage of a reaction and at the same time the graphenes are laminated in the direction of . In this case it can be considered that since a high pressure compressed gas exhibits a shielding effect on the surface of graphene thus inhibiting graphenes from adhering and jointing to each other to form into a multi layer the growth of graphenes is inhibited much in the direction of and graphenes are grown much radically in the direction of thereby generating the cluster of multi layer graphenes of the present invention.

The pre baked starting material to be subjected to HIP treatment can be a powdery and or particulate material in various forms such as circle ellipse column cylindrical column fiber and block having an undefined shape . In any shapes multi layer graphenes are grown such that graphenes spread approximately radially from the surface of the pre baked starting material in a direction while connecting carbons and at the same time the graphenes are laminated in the direction of . So far only graphite materials in which graphenes are grown all together in one direction on the particle for example graphite materials having high anisotropy which have orientation in the direction of on the surface of the particle and orientation in the direction of in the thickness of the particle have been able to be produced . However according to the present invention the graphenes are grown toward the direction of and the growth toward the direction of extends approximately radially. As a result a cluster of multi layer graphenes composed of aggregates in such a state that multi layer graphenes extend from the inside toward the outside can be obtained . Moreover such a cluster of multi layer graphenes can be in the form of isotropic graphite particles or in the form of a bulky graphite structure comprising such isotropic graphite particles.

A degree of growth of the graphenes inside and outside of the pre baked starting material is determined by selection of a pre baking temperature and an amount of remaining hydrogen of the pre baked starting material a structure of a graphite crucible and HIP treatment conditions. By selecting suitable conditions the graphenes can be generated on the outer surface and the inside of the pre baked starting material as shown in a degree of crystallinity as a bulky cluster of graphenes can be increased and a true density can be enhanced.

The mechanism of generation of the graphenes of the present invention is explained in more detail. The pre baked starting material is subjected to isostatic application of pressure with a pressurized medium such as argon and nitrogen in the HIP treatment. Therefore at the initial stage of the HIP treatment a high pressure and high density phase is formed around the particles of the pre baked starting material. When the HIP treatment temperature is elevated more than the pre baking temperature generation of gases from the pre baked starting material starts but since a coefficient of diffusion of the gases into the pressurized medium having a high pressure and high density becomes small reaction gas regions hydrogen hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and the like of high concentration are formed around the pre baked starting material. In the HIP treatment isotropic application of a pressure is carried out and therefore the reaction gas regions are formed uniformly on the outer surface of the particles in the form being analogous to the shape of the particles.

In these reaction gas regions when the HIP treatment temperature becomes further high particularly about 900 C. or more excitation occurs and so called thermal CVD reaction occurs to precipitate graphenes. Generally CVD reaction is carried out by supplying a reaction gas to a surface of a substrate using a CVD apparatus a plasma CVD apparatus or the like. However the reaction mechanism of the present invention is characterized by carrying out CVD reaction in a reaction gas region generated around the pre baked starting material in the graphite crucible by using HIP equipment. Therefore in the case of a spherical pre baked starting material graphenes are generated approximately radially from the surface of the spherical particle as shown in and in the case of particles having irregular shapes graphenes analogous to each other are generated from the surfaces of the particles as shown in .

The reason why there is an optimum temperature range for pre baking the starting material is such that proper percentages of gas components such as hydrocarbon hydrogen and carbon monoxide are necessary in order to generate graphenes efficiently in the CVD reaction. For example in the case of a pre baking temperature exceeding about 900 C. an amount of remaining hydrogen becomes small which makes it difficult to precipitate graphenes efficiently. Moreover the reason why there is an optimum range of HIP treatment temperature is such that it was found that when the HIP treatment temperature is lower than about 900 C. thermal excitation of the generated gas hardly occurs and CVD reaction hardly proceeds and when the HIP treatment temperature exceeds about 2000 C. there is a large effect of etching of precipitated graphenes due to hydrogen.

With respect to a particle size of the pre baked starting material to be used since CVD reaction occurs mainly on the surface of the particles if the particle size is large a ratio of the surface area to the volume of the particle is small and as a result an amount of the graphenes in the obtained product is reduced. Therefore when using a starting material having a smaller particle size a ratio of generated graphenes can be increased . Accordingly from the viewpoint of production efficiency in the case of using a spherical resin it is preferable that its particle size average is about 100 m or less. Meanwhile in the case of application where it is desired to grow graphenes only in the vicinity of surfaces of hard carbon material particles such as glassy carbon a target product can be obtained easily by selecting particles having a particle size larger than 100 m according to necessity.

In a conventional method for producing graphite materials only those having high anisotropy in which carbon hexagonal planes are laminated in the form of film in parallel with a surface of a substrate could be produced. However the present invention made it possible to grow graphenes in which the number of graphenes laminated is controlled efficiently in a three dimensional space and as a result to produce a cluster of multi layer graphenes including isotropic graphite particles and a bulky graphite structure composed of aggregates in such a state that multi layer graphemes extend from the inside toward the outside in a very short period of time So far it has been difficult to synthesize graphenes directly in a large amount because graphenes are obtained by peeling from a graphite material or by forming on a metal substrate using a catalytic effect of metal. However according to the present invention a large amount of graphenes can be produced directly using general purpose HIP equipment and usual organic materials.

Generally an organic compound as it is heated becomes larger in molecular weight and then oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen atoms in its structure become thermodynamically instable and released and thereby carbonization proceeds. Therefore in most of organic compounds such a reaction proceeds by heat treating at a temperature of about 300 C. or more. In the case of about 400 C. or more a pre baked starting material comprising carbon and proper amounts of remaining hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is obtained. In the present invention the thus pre baked organic compound can be used as a pre baked starting material.

Examples of usable organic compound are those mentioned below. There can be used for example natural organic polymers such as starch cellulose protein collagen alginic acid dammar kovar rosin gutta percha and natural rubber semisynthetic polymers such as cellulose resin cellulose acetate cellulose nitrate cellulose acetate butyrate casein plastic and soybean protein plastic and synthetic polymers such as thermosetting reins such as phenol resin urea resin melamine resin benzoguanamine resin epoxy resin diallyl phthalate resin unsaturated polyester resin bisphenol A type epoxy resin Novolac type epoxy resin polyfunctional epoxy resin alicyclic epoxy resin alkyd resin and urethane resin thermoplastic resins such as polyester resins polyethylene terephthalate PET resin polytrimethylene terephthalate resin polybutylene terephthalate resin polyethylene naphthalate resin polybutylene naphthalate resin and the like vinyl chloride resin polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene synthetic rubbers such as polyisoprene and butadiene synthetic fibers such as nylon vinylon acrylic fiber and rayon and other materials such as polyvinyl acetate ABS resin AS resin acrylic resin polyacetal polyimide polycarbonate modified polyphenylene ether PPE polyarylate polysulfone polyphenylene sulfide polyether ether ketone fluorine containing resin polyamide imide and silicon resin.

It is a matter of course that petroleum pitch coal pitch petroleum coke coal coke carbon black and active carbon which are generated when fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal for example being refined can be used as a starting material. In addition toward the establishment of resources recycling society introduction of carbonization system has been advanced from the viewpoint of effective utilization of carbon in wastes and waste plastics and waste PET bottles which are mixtures of the above mentioned various resins waste wood waste plants and food wastes such as garbage can also be used as an organic compound being a starting material.

These hydrocarbon starting materials are pre baked at a pre baking temperature at a specified temperature elevating rate in an inert atmosphere such as in a nitrogen gas stream by burning with oxygen without releasing carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. For the pre baking an electric heating or gas heating type externally heating batch oven continuous multi tubular oven internal heating rotary kiln oscillating kiln or the like is used.

The above mentioned film like mass of multi layer graphenes of B can be produced by growing multi layer graphenes on a surface of a substrate made for example of glassy carbon diamond like carbon amorphous carbon graphite copper nickel iron cobalt other heat resistant metal ceramic SiC GaN Si or other semiconductor in the production method of A the above mentioned cluster of multi layer graphenes. In this case the substrate can be in various forms such as circle column pyramid cone and an undefined shape in addition to a flat sheet such as a spacer and a surface of the substrate may be subjected to rough polishing or mirror polishing. The productivity and shape of the obtained film like mass of multi layer graphenes can be controlled by changing a shape and surface conditions of the substrate.

The above mentioned fibrous mass of multi layer graphenes of C is one simultaneously generated in the above mentioned production method of the cluster of multi layer graphenes of A .

The above mentioned cluster of cloven multi layer graphenes of D can be produced via a graphite intercalation compound compound in which sulfate ion organic complex of alkali metal and the like are intercalating between the graphite layers produced using the above mentioned cluster of multi layer graphenes of A as a host material. Namely by intercalation of ion and the like between the graphite layers an interval between the layers of the multi layer graphenes forming the cluster of multi layer graphenes is increased and thereby a stress arises at various portions of the cluster of multi layer graphenes. Further by subjecting the graphite intercalation compound to rapid heating a volume of multi layer graphenes expands rapidly in the direction of c axis of the multi layer graphenes. Through these processes a thinner graphene which results from effective cleaving of multi layer graphenes can be produced.

A graphene layer can hold either of electron or hole as a carrier and therefore it can form any of intercalation compounds of electron accepting acceptor type and electron donating donor type. Many of such intercalation compounds have been researched and developed so far in a graphite having many laminated graphene layers and are known as graphite intercalation compounds Michio Inagaki Carbon 1989 No. 139 207 213 . A graphite intercalation compound using a cluster of multi layer graphenes as a host material can be prepared by a usual process for example by adding the cluster of multi layer graphenes into a mixed solution of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid a tetrahydrofuran solution of alkali metal and condensation polycyclic hydrocarbon or the like and then stirring the mixture. A method for rapid heating of the thus obtained graphite intercalation compound is not limited particularly and for example there is exemplified a method for charging an intercalation compound in a magnetic crucible made of ceramic or the like and charging the crucible in a heated electric oven. In this case the temperature of the electric oven is preferably within a range from 600 to 1000 C. Through such a process the thickness of the multi layer graphenes will be from about 0.34 nm to about 9 nm. The cluster of cloven multi layer graphenes is composed of single layer graphene and multi layer graphene which are thinner than the multi layer graphenes constituting the initial cluster of multi layer graphenes and therefore is more preferable for producing a transparent conductive film having light transmission and electric conductivity.

With respect to the thus obtained masses of multi layer graphenes B to D mentioned above preferred ranges of the true density and total pore ratio thereof are the same as those explained in the cluster of multi layer graphenes of A .

It is described the method for laminating on surface of a substrate multi layer graphenes from the thus obtained mass of multi layer graphenes wherein said multi layer graphens constitute the mass of multi layer graphenes.

The substrate is not limited particularly as far as it is one made of a material being usable for laminating multi layer graphenes thereon in other words as far as it is one made of a material on which multi layer graphenes can be bonded to its surface by Van der Waals force. Preferred examples thereof are a resin film having electron bond of benzene nucleus double bond or the like in its molecular structure a metal foil a metal sheet a metal film paper a glassy carbon substrate a sapphire substrate and the like. It can be considered that a resin film having electron bond forms a stronger Van der Waals bond between the graphenes due to overlapping with a electron orbit of the graphene. Examples of such a resin having electron bond are polyester resin for example PET resin polytrimethylene terephthalate resin polybutylene terephthalate resin polyethylene naphthalate resin polybutylene naphthalate resin and the like acrylic resin polystyrene resin polycarbonate resin polypropylene resin polyethylene resin polyvinyl chloride resin polytetrafluoroethylene resin Teflon registered trade mark resin and the like. Among these resins PET resin polystyrene resin and polycarbonate resin are preferable and PET resin having high mechanical strength is most preferable. These resins can be formed into a film to be used as a substrate and in addition one or a mixture of two or more thereof can be coated on surface of a glass sheet to form a glass sheet coated with these resins and the coated glass sheet can be used as a substrate. Examples of metal forming a metal foil a metal sheet or a metal film are copper nickel iron aluminum titanium and the like and among these copper is preferable. Paper is a kind of a non woven fabric made of vegetable fiber mainly cellulose and examples thereof are a free sheet a coated paper a Kent paper a glossy paper a simili paper an impregnated kraft paper and the like.

With respect to a substrate made of a material being usable for laminating multi layer graphenes thereon there can be exemplified a non woven fabric made of a resin fiber. Preferred more as a resin is one having electron bond. Examples of a resin having in electron bond are aromatic polyamide resin aromatic polyimide resin polyester resin and the like.

The lamination of multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate is carried out via Van der Waals bond and therefore any means can be suitably used as far as it is means being capable of bringing multi layer graphenes into contact with a surface of a substrate and forming Van der Waals bond.

There is exemplified for example means for rubbing the surface of the substrate with the mass of multi layer graphenes. For the rubbing any rubbing method may be employed as far as the mass of multi layer graphenes is brought into contact uniformly with the surface of a substrate. Though the rubbing depends on sizes of a substrate and a mass of multi layer graphenes when rubbing with a mass of multi layer graphenes having a size as large as it can be held with fingers on a substrate of 30 mm square the rubbing may be carried out in four directions vertically horizontally and diagonally to the upper right and the upper left. When rubbing the substrate from its one end to another end once in each direction the number of rubbing cycles is assumed to be one and the rubbing may be carried out plural times for example 2 to 10 times preferably 3 to 8 times more preferably 4 to 6 times .

In order to coat multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate with high productivity it is effective to use a graphene coating tool. Here the graphene coating tool is a tool for coating multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate and the tool has its surface to be brought into contact with the surface of the substrate and holds a mass of multi layer graphenes on its surface. Here the surface of the tool means the surface of the tool holding the mass of multi layer graphenes thereon and having a function of rubbing the mass of multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate to be processed by bringing the surface of the tool into contact with the surface of a substrate to be processed. The surface of the tool may be in any of shapes as far as the above mentioned function is fulfilled. For example it may be in the form of plane or in the gently curved form. Further holding means a state of a certain substance being retained at a certain position and holding means is not questioned. Therefore this stands for a concept also including a state of a mass of multi layer graphenes being adhered to the surface of the tool using an adhesive or the like. While various kinds of tools can be considered as the graphene coating tool shows its example in a schematic diagram and is a photograph showing an appearance of a rotary tool prepared in Example 9. In the tools shown in a mass of multi layer graphenes is adhered to a surface of a pedestal a surface of the tool via an epoxy resin adhesive layer . A of FIG. shows a type such that a tool is mounted on a given machinery with bolts and nuts. In B of the pedestal is jointed to a gripper so as to enable the rubbing to be conducted by hand. The rubbing is carried out while holding the gripper by hand. In C of the mass of multi layer graphenes is adhered to the surface of the pedestal with the adhesive layer and the pedestal is further jointed to a rotary shaft through which the tool can be therefore mounted on a rotary processing machine such as a reamer a drill or a machining center. Accordingly the mass of multi layer graphenes can be rubbed on a substrate material with rotating the tool. A material of the tool is not limited particularly as far as its shape is maintained and any material may be used. Example of such material is a hard material such as stainless steel.

In order to conduct the coating of multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate with higher productivity it is effective to rub the mass of multi layer graphenes using the graphene coating tool on a substrate material which is made of a material having high hardness and is fed continuously by roll to roll process and is moved at a given speed in a certain direction. The rubbing can be carried out by pressing a stationary tool or a rotating or vibrated tool on a substrate such as a resin film being moved at high speed. The tool can be fixed at a desired position and coating can be conducted without interruption on a substrate material being fed continuously.

Example of another means for lamination is one for bringing a surface of a substrate into contact with a dispersion of multi layer graphenes prepared from the mass of multi layer graphenes and then removing the solvent from the surface of a substrate.

Preparation of the dispersion of multi layer graphenes from the mass of multi layer graphenes can be made for example by pulverizing the mass of multi layer graphenes previously pouring the obtained powder into a solvent applying ultrasonic wave to the solvent conducting centrifugal separation and then collecting an obtained supernatant. Or the preparation can be carried out by pouring the mass of multi layer graphenes into a solvent pulverizing the mass conducting centrifugal separation and then collecting an obtained supernatant.

Here since a compressed gas is attached to the surface of the mass of multi layer graphenes the mass of multi layer graphenes or a powder obtained by pulverization thereof may according to necessity be heat treated for example at a temperature of 100 C. to remove the compressed gas and then subjected to the following steps.

The method for pulverizing before pouring into a solvent is not limited particularly as far as the multi layer graphenes can be separated from the mass of multi layer graphenes. The pulverization can be carried out for example by physically breaking into thin pieces with a dry or wet mechanical pulverizer a mixer a blender a ball mill a vibration mill an ultrasonic wave mill a homogenizer an ultrasonic wave homogenizer an ultrasonic wave pulverizer or a mortar.

The method for pulverizing after pouring into a solvent is not limited particularly as far as the method can separate the multi layer graphenes from the mass of multi layer graphenes in the solvent. The pulverization can be carried out for example by physically breaking the mass of multi layer graphenes in the solvent into thin pieces with a rotary mixer or the like.

Examples of the solvent are carbonic acid esters such as 1 2 dichloroethane benzene thionyl chloride acetyl chloride tetrachloroethylene carbonate dichloroethylene carbonate benzoyl fluoride benzoyl chloride nitromethane nitrobenzene acetic anhydride phosphorus oxychloride benzonitrile selenium oxychloride acetonitrile tetramethylsulfone dioxane 1 2 propanediol carbonate benzyl cyanide ethylene sulfite isobutyronitrile propionitrile dimethyl carbonate propylene carbonate ethyl methyl carbonate diethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate polyhydric alcohols such as phenyl phosphorous acid difluoride methyl acetate n butyronitrile acetone ethyl acetate water phenyl phosphoric acid dichloride diethyl ether tetrahydrofuran diphenyl phosphoric acid chloride trimethyl phosphate tributyl phosphate dimethylformamide N methylpyrrolidine n dimethylacetamide dimethyl sulfoxide N diethylformamide N diethylacetamide pyridine hexamethylphosphoric amide hexane carbon tetrachloride diglyme trichloromethane 2 propanol methanol ethanol propanol ethylene glycol methyl ethyl ketone 2 methoxyethanol dimethylacetamide toluene polybenzimidazole and the like. These solvents can be used alone or can be used in a mixture of at least two thereof.

In addition a dispersant can be added to these solvents in order to increase an amount of dispersed graphene or to prevent agglomeration of the graphenes in a solvent. Examples of a dispersant are surfactants and in addition those having a week binding force to graphene and an electric attracting force such as a Coulomb s force and having a hydrophilic functional group such as hydroxyl and carboxyl in a structure thereof. Examples of the latter dispersants are monomers and polymers of phenols such as phenol and naphthol having hydroxyl bonded to a benzene nucleus monomers and polymers of styrene propylene acrylonitrile vinyl acetate and the like having carbon double bond proteins such as collagen keratin actin myosin casein albumin GFP and RFP amino acids such as glycine tyrosine threonine and glutamine and the like.

Examples of usable surfactants are anion based surfactants anionic surfactants such as fatty acid salts for example sodium dodecanoate cholic acid salts for example sodium cholate monoalkyl sulfates for example sodium lauryl sulfate alkyl polyoxyethylene sulfate alkyl benzene sulfonates for example sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and monoalkyl phosphate cation based surfactants cationic surfactants such as alkyl trimethyl ammonium salts for example cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide dialkyl dimethyl ammonium salts for example didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and alkyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium salts for example alkyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride amphoteric surfactants Gemini surfactants such as alkyl dimethyl amine oxide and alkyl carboxybetaine and

non ionic surfactants nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether for example polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether fatty acid sorbitan ester alkyl polyglucoside fatty acid diethanol amide and alkyl monoglyceryl ether. Among these monoalkyl sulfates are preferred more.

Among the above mentioned solvents preferred are dimethylformamide water to which a dispersant preferably a surfactant is added 2 methoxyethanol and the like.

An amount of a dispersant is within a range from 0.001 to 10 wt preferably from 0.02 to 5 wt based on the weight of a solvent. The amount is not always limited to the above mentioned range in the case where a cleaning step is conducted after forming a coating film such as a transparent conductive film or a conductive film.

An amount of the mass of multi layer graphenes is within a range from 0.001 to 50 wt preferably from 0.01 to 10 wt based on the weight of a solvent.

A means for ultrasonic wave treatment is not particularly limited and it can be carried out by using for example an ultrasonic cleaner. It is preferable that a frequency of an ultrasonic wave to be applied is within a range from about 20 kHz to about 100 kHz. A period of time for the treatment is preferably from about 1 minute to about 60 minutes.

It is preferable that centrifugation is carried out at an acceleration rate within a range from about 100 G to about 100000 G preferably from about 100 G to about 10000 G for about 1 minute to about 60 minutes preferably for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes.

In the supernatant obtained in the manner mentioned above after the centrifugation is dispersed the mass of multi layer graphenes. To this dispersion can be added additives for example a viscosity improver a dispersant a diluent and the like which are usually used in this field if desired so.

In the case of producing a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes requiring no light transmitting property like electrode materials for lithium ion batteries and heat releasing sheets it is effective to laminate graphenes thick on surface of a substrate or to laminate multi layer graphenes on concave portions of surface of a substrate such as a porous non woven fabric. In such a case it is effective to use a liquid of pulverized multi layer graphenes or a dispersion of residual graphenes which contains the multi layer graphenes at higher concentration.

The liquid of pulverized multi layer graphenes can be prepared by pulverizing the mass of multi layer graphenes previously and then pouring the obtained powder into a solvent or by pouring the mass of multi layer graphenes into a solvent and then pulverizing the mass. Preparation conditions such as a solvent and a dispersant to be used pulverizing means and an amount of multi layer graphenes to be poured are the same as mentioned with respect to the dispersion of multi layer graphenes.

The dispersion of residual graphenes can be prepared by adding the above mentioned solvent and if necessary a dispersant and the like to a residual after the centrifugal separation one remaining after removing a supernatant after the centrifugal separation which is obtained when preparing the dispersion of multi layer graphenes. It is preferable that the concentration of the residual graphenes in the dispersion of residual graphenes is from 1 wt to 90 wt .

For bringing the dispersion of multi layer graphenes the liquid of pulverized multi layer graphenes and the dispersion of residual graphenes hereinafter collectively referred to as the dispersion of multi layer graphenes etc. into contact with a surface of a substrate any methods may be employed as far as the purpose of contact can be achieved. Examples of the method which can be suitably used are those using the existing techniques such as usual coating methods such as dip coating spin coating die coating and spray coating and in addition ink jet printing printing using a dispenser flexographic printing letterpress printing offset printing planographic printing gravure printing intaglio printing screen printing electrophotography heat transfer laser transfer slit coating bar coating blade coating melt extrusion molding method in combination of a resin and an additive inflation method T die method flat die method solvent casting method calendaring method stretching method multilayer processing method co extrusion method co extrusion by inflation method multi manifold method laminating method extrusion laminating method laminating method using an adhesive wet laminating method dry laminating method hot melt laminating method heat seal method external heating method internal heating method ion plating and sputtering. Further for removing the solvent from the surface of the substrate any methods may be employed as far as the purpose of removal can be achieved. The removal can be usually carried out by drying using a usual method the surface of the substrate brought into contact with the dispersion of multi layer graphenes etc. The drying may be carried out by heating and or air blowing or air drying.

For example by dip coating of the surface of the substrate with the dispersion of multi layer graphenes etc. the surface of the substrate can be brought into contact with the dispersion of multi layer graphenes etc. and the solvent can be removed from the surface of the substrate. The conditions for the dip coating vary depending on kinds of a solvent and a substrate to be used an amount of the mass of multi layer graphenes to be poured into a solvent etc. For example the temperature of the dispersion is preferably 40 C. or more more preferably 50 C. or more further preferably 60 C. or more in order to smoothly remove dry the solvent from the surface of the substrate. The speed for lifting up the substrate is preferably from 1000 to 1 m sec for example when forming a film by one dip in one solution tank. However when carrying out film formation plural times using many solution tanks the speed is not limited to the above mentioned range and film formation at higher speed can be made.

In the thus obtained substrate coated with multi layer graphenes the thickness of the coated layer thereof is from about 0.5 nm to about 300 nm preferably from about 2 nm to about 100 nm and the substrate is useful as a transparent conductive film or a transparent electrode. Further in an application requiring no light transmitting property like a conductive film for a lithium ion battery a thick coated layer having a thickness as thick as from about 1 m to about 10 m is useful for such a required property.

Other method for bringing the dispersion of graphenes into contact with the surface of the substrate and removing the solvent from the surface of the substrate is a spray coating method including wet blast etc. for spraying a dispersion of graphenes together with a high pressure gas onto the surface of the substrate. In this method a compressed gas such as air nitrogen or argon compressed to 0.1 to 10 MPa with a compressor is used and a high pressure gas liquid mixture from a gas liquid mixer such as a spray gun or an air gun is sprayed onto the surface of a substrate. In this case when the dispersion of graphenes comes into contact with the surface of the substrate graphenes easily comes into contact with the surface of the substrate and are easily adhered thereto and the gas is easily dried and evaporated due to air stream. Further according to necessity when a liquid and gas maintained at high temperature are used and or when the surface of the substrate is heated graphenes can be coated efficiently on the surface of the substrate. In the case of mass production of a transparent conductive film a conductive film or an electrode sheet film formation can be carried out with high productivity by feeding the substrate by roll to roll process and spraying a high pressure gas and a dispersion of graphenes onto the surface of the substrate at high speed.

In the case of electrode materials for lithium ion batteries and heat releasing sheets requiring no light transmitting property it is useful to form a thick graphene layer by laminating multi layer graphenes thick this can be said to be a thin graphite layer or to laminate or fill multi layer graphenes inside a resin substrate such as a porous non woven fabric. In these cases it is effective to use as a liquid for spray coating the liquid of pulverized multi layer graphenes or the dispersion of residual graphenes which comprise multi layer graphenes at higher concentration.

In the case of a transparent conductive film for a touch panel requiring high light transmitting property it is effective to laminate graphemes of a small number of layers thin on the surface of the substrate. In such a case when employing usual spray coating two fluid spray coating using two fluids i.e. liquid and gas there is a case where thin graphenes are easily scattered due to a velocity of compressed gas resulting in high possibility that the graphenes cannot reach the surface of the substrate. To prevent this it is effective to use a dispersion of multi layer graphenes or a dispersion of multi layer graphenes comprising thinner graphenes which is obtained from the supernatant after carrying out further centrifugal separation sufficiently and also to use a single fluid type spray coating such as a dispenser or an ink jet in which only a slight amount of a dispersion in the form of droplet is ejected from a tip of a nozzle in order to increase a rate of multi layer graphenes reaching the surface of the substrate. It is preferable that an inner diameter of the nozzle to be used is from about 1 m to about 1000 m.

In the substrate coated with multi layer graphenes of the present invention it is preferable that the surface of the substrate is laminated with multi layer graphenes as mentioned above and then is further subjected to pressing. This is rather preferred in a transparent conductive film application etc. where thin lamination of multi layer graphenes of a small number of layers is required. The thickness of the graphene of the present invention is about 1 nm in the case of a small number of layers while on the surface of the substrate for example a PET film there is a deviation in surface roughness and thickness at a level of from 100 to 1000 nm. Therefore for example when carrying out the lamination by bringing the dispersion of graphenes into contact with the surface of the substrate and then removing the solvent there is a case where it is difficult to bring the surface of graphene into close contact uniformly completely with the surface of the substrate. In such a case it can be considered that it is effective to get the surface of graphene close to the surface of the substrate by applying a pressure by pressing to an interface between the multi layer graphene and the substrate in order to enhance orientation of the multi layer graphene and in addition to increase adhesion of the multi layer graphene to the substrate. Also in this case by pressing under heating a resin for example in the case of a resin substrate is easily deformed due to heating thereby enabling the surface of the multi layer graphene to come into closer contact with the surface of the substrate. Further it is possible to bring the surface of multi layer graphene into close contact more uniformly completely with the surface of the substrate by precisely polishing surface of parts to be used for pressing to improve surface roughness a degree of parallelization and flatness thereof because the resin substrate or the like follows to fit to the surface of the parts by deformation. Moreover it is effective to previously subject the surface of the substrate to be coated to cleaning or surface treating by corona treatment plasma treatment or the like thereby increasing adhesion between the multi layer graphene and the substrate.

For pressing any of known methods such as cold rolling and hot rolling can be adopted. From the viewpoint of increasing productivity it is effective to use equipment for mass production such as roll press and hot press. Especially it is effective to carry out hot press after roll press hot roll press under heating. The heating temperature in the roll press depends on a material of a substrate to be used and is preferably from about 70 C. to about 300 C. The press load is preferably from about 1 N to about 100000 N and the feeding speed is preferably from about 0.1 cm sec to about 10 cm sec. In the hot press the heating temperature is preferably from about 70 C. to about 300 C. the press load is preferably from about 1 N to about 5000000 N and the pressing time is preferably from about 10 sec to about 10 min.

The multi layer graphene has a smaller number of laminated graphene layers and a larger Van der Waals force as compared with conventional graphite. Therefore by making use of this Van der Waals force adhesive force multi layer graphenes are laminated and filled in an optional shape and as a result a graphite structure having high crystallinity can be obtained. Conventional graphite materials have been produced by molding a starting material such as a resin and gradually carbonizing and graphitizing the molded starting material up to high temperature of about 3000 C. In that case in order to make various shapes it was necessary to carry out complicated steps such as a step for cutting or grinding a graphite material by machining or mixing a graphite powder with a binder and then conducting coating press molding or the like. In the present invention by the easy method for laminating and filling on substrates having various shapes multi layer graphenes having been produced previously it is made possible to endow features of substrate such as strength flexibility and light weight and features of graphenes and graphite obtained by laminating graphenes such as electric conductivity thermal conductivity electro magnetic interference shielding property antibacterial activity lubricity heat resistance and chemical resistance.

When multi layer graphenes are laminated as the lamination proceeds the form and characteristics thereof come close to those of graphite. Therefore it is possible to produce graphite materials of various forms by so called bottom up system by applying the method of the present invention.

For example by making use of high thermal conductivity of graphite a thin graphite sheet is used as countermeasures for heat accumulation or locally heated heat spot inside a thin mobile terminal such as smartphone. So far technique for processing of a graphite material into a large size thick part such as an electrode for steel making has been established but it is difficult to process a graphite material into a sheet like part. Therefore graphite sheets produced by synthesizing a graphite intercalation compound using graphite and sulfuric acid rapidly heating the obtained compound for expansion and subjecting the expanded graphite to rolling or hot press molding and graphite films produced by laminating resin films of polyimide or the like which is easily graphitized and then heat treating the laminated films up to about 3000 C. under pressure have been put into practical use. Actually graphite sheets having a thickness of about 100 m and graphite films having a thickness of about 50 m are put into practical use. However graphite alone tends to be low in mechanical strength and adhesive force and it is difficult to produce graphite materials being thinner and having good mechanical strength and processability.

By applying the method of the present invention and laminating multi layer graphenes on a porous resin substrate having relatively high percentage of voids to fill multi layer graphenes in the voids of the substrate it is possible to produce thin members and sheets having good processability high strength and excellent characteristics of graphite such as electric conductivity thermal conductivity heat resistance chemical resistance and antibacterial property. Steps for laminating and filling multi layer graphenes on a substrate are not limited particularly and various processing methods such as the above mentioned method for laminating multi layer graphenes on surface of a substrate can be used. Whichever method is used among the above mentioned processing methods it is possible to laminate and fill graphenes on a substrate without using a binder due to a high adhesive force of multi layer graphenes especially several graphene layers or a single layer graphene. The method of the present invention has a feature of laminating and filling multi layer graphenes without using a binder as mentioned above. However the use of a binder and a surfactant which may be required for increasing productivity and product area is not limited particularly.

As a specific preparation method of a graphite film since the lamination is carried out via Van der Waals bond any means for preparation can be suitably used as far as multi layer graphenes can be brought into contact with the surface of the substrate and Van der Waals bond can be formed. Examples of the method are a method for rubbing surface of a substrate with the mass of multi layer graphenes a method for bringing surface of a substrate into contact with a dispersion of multi layer graphenes obtained from the mass of multi layer graphenes and then removing the solvent from the surface of a substrate a method for increasing an adhesive force between the substrate and the graphene by cold rolling hot rolling roll press hot press or the like an optional combination of these methods and a method for repeating these methods. Also in order to increase strength of a graphite film a binder and additives usually used in this field for example a thickener a dispersant a diluent and the like can be added to the dispersion of graphene.

In the case of forming a transparent conductive film for a touch panel since high light transmissivity is required it is effective to use fibrous or tube like multi layer graphenes and form a conductive path for flowing electric current while holding light transmissivity with relatively low covering degree.

Among the substrates coated with multi layer graphenes according to the present invention the substrate coated with multi layer graphenes and having a pattern of thick and thin layers of multi layer graphenes multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern can be produced by preparing a transfer mold provided with convex and concave portions coinciding with the pattern on the surface of the mold overlapping a back surface of the substrate resin film non woven fabric paper or the like over the surface of the transfer mold and rubbing multi layer graphenes of a mass of multi layer graphenes on the surface of the substrate.

Here pattern means a figure or a design formed by one of thick and thin coated layers for example a thick coated layer thick layer . Nonlimiting examples of the pattern are lattice net and polka dot. An arrangement plan of a circuit for example electronic circuit and the like can also be used as a pattern. In the pattern the thick layer portion can be used for example as a conductive layer. The thick layer portion may be a continuous layer. Moreover the thin coated layer thin layer portion can be used for example for securing light transmissivity.

The transfer mold is a base material provided with a pattern of convex and concave portions on its surface and is used for reproducing the pattern on surface of a substrate in such a manner that the convex portion supports the substrate from its bottom with a stronger force than that of the concave portion thereby rubbing multi layer graphenes on the surface of the substrate over the convex portion thicker than on the surface of the substrate over the concave portion. The transfer mold may be in the form of plane or in the curved form. The material of the transfer mold is not limited particularly as far as it has strength being capable of withstanding the rubbing. Examples of the material are metal for example aluminum etc. ceramic and the like.

When carrying out the rubbing in the case where the substrate is a film made of a resin having electron bond or a non woven fabric made of fibers of the same resin the surface of the substrate may be warmed previously. By warming the substrate the resin is softened and comes into close contact with the transfer mold and as a result the pattern of the transfer mold is easily reproduced on the surface of the substrate. The warming temperature varies depending on kind of a resin and is preferably within a range from about 30 C. to about 350 C. more preferably within a range from about 50 C. to about 250 C. In this case the substrate can be warmed by usual method for example warming can be achieved by placing a metal transfer mold having good thermal conductivity on a hot plate having been set at a given temperature holding the transfer mold thereon for a while to warm its surface and then placing the substrate thereon.

With respect to the method for producing the multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern the description on the method for producing the substrate coated with multi layer graphenes can be applied unless contradictory to the description mentioned above.

The thus obtained multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern is useful as a transparent conductive film having both of transparency and conductivity and in addition the film itself functions as a circuit if a circuit is used as a pattern. Further the multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern can be used as a heat releasing sheet a static electricity eliminating sheet or the like.

There is no definite limitation in a size and a shape of particles constituting a powdery and or particulate material and a powdery material being composed of relatively fine particles and particulate material being composed of comparatively coarse particles are encompassed.

Further the open pore ratio apparent pore ratio is a ratio of a volume of a open cavity which exists in a volume obtained from the outer shape of a material and into which a liquid or gas can invade. Generally a material having a high open pore ratio has a continuous pore and has air permeability. In this specification the open pore ratio is obtained from the following equation. Open pore ratio Apparent specific gravity Bulk specific gravity Apparent specific gravity 100 Apparent specific gravity A value measured using a sample before pulverization by a helium gas substitution pycnometer method using a densimeter AccuPyc 1330 PCW available from Shimadzu Corporation Bulk specific gravity A value obtained by dividing a sample weight by a volume calculated from outer dimensions of the sample

Further the total pore ratio is a ratio of a volume of a total cavity including closed pores in addition to open pores existing in a volume calculated from outer shape of a sample. In this specification the total pore ratio is obtained from the following equation. Total pore ratio True specific gravity Bulk specific gravity True specific gravity 100 True specific gravity A specific gravity measured using a target material in a state of being pulverized into a fine powder in order to minimize an effect attributable to a cavity contained in the target material and in Examples and Production Examples of this specification the true specific gravity is measured using a powder sample having passed through a 74 m filter.

An apparent specific gravity a bulk specific gravity and a true specific gravity are synonymous with an apparent density a bulk density and a true density respectively.

In this specification the spacer and the sleeve are used being placed inside the closed vessel made of graphite and is inserted between the inner wall of the vessel and the pre baked starting material so that the both do not come into direct contact with each other. The spacer is one covering the pre baked starting material mainly from the top and bottom thereof and the sleeve is one covering the pre baked starting material from the side thereof. There can be a case where discrimination between the spacer and the sleeve is meaningless depending on a shape of the vessel.

 Bulk in the terms such as bulky bulky state or bulky structure means that the basic component units are connected each other.

The average particle size particle size average was measured by a laser diffraction scattering method using a laser diffraction density distribution measuring device. Namely a density distribution was determined by emitting laser beam to the group of particles and calculating from a distribution pattern of intensity of beams diffracting and scattering therefrom.

In this specification in the case of a numerical range shown for example by 1200 to 1900 this stands for a range of 1200 or more and 1900 or less.

The cluster of multi layer graphenes which had a size of from several millimeters to several tens millimeters and could be held by hand was selected from those produced in Production Example 1. An SEM of the surface of the cluster of graphenes is shown in . It is seen that the obtained cluster has a structure composed of many aggregated multi layer graphenes in the form of flower leaf having a size of several microns and an extremely thin thickness.

A 300 m thick PET resin film was cut into a shape of 30 mm 30 mm and the surface thereof was wiped with a swab impregnated with ethyl alcohol for cleaning and degreasing treatment to prepare a substrate.

The surface of the substrate was rubbed with the cluster of multi layer graphenes held on a hand to cause a friction force at an interface between the substrate and the cluster of multi layer graphenes thereby forming a multi layer graphene layer on the surface of the substrate. In the rubbing of the surface of the substrate with the cluster of multi layer graphenes first the rubbing was carried out in one direction on the film referred to as a vertical direction then in a traversing direction at a right angle to the vertical direction and further in the directions at angles of 45 and 315 to the vertical direction. In each direction the rubbing was conducted from one end to another end of the film. When the rubbing was conducted once in each of four directions the number of rubbing cycles was assumed to be one and the rubbing was carried out plural times so that the multi layer graphenes could be transferred to the whole surface of the substrate to enable sufficient electric conductivity on the surface to be obtained.

The surface of the obtained substrate coated with multi layer graphenes transparent conductive film turned light grey but characters carried on a paper were readable through the film. An optical microscope photograph of the surface of the transparent conductive film is shown in and SEM photographs thereof are shown in and . It was confirmed that the multi layer graphenes could have been coated on the surface of the substrate without a blank space. Since the PET resin film as a substrate has no electric conductivity when electron beams are emitted thereto an electron density on the surface of the substrate is increased and the substrate is overheated and deformed and therefore observation of the surface of the substrate with SEM is difficult. However in the substrate coated with multi layer graphenes electron conductivity arose on the surface of the substrate and the surface could be observed stably with SEM.

The surface resistance of the obtained transparent conductive film was measured with a surface resistance meter resistivity meter LORESTA EP MCP T360 available from Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech Co. Ltd. by a 4 pin probe constant current method A surface resistance was measured hereinafter by the same method . With respect to light transmittance light transmissivity at each of wavelengths of 400 nm 500 nm 600 nm and 700 nm was measured with a visible ultraviolet spectrophotometer CE1021 available from AS ONE Corporation Light transmissivity was measured hereinafter by the same method . The results thereof are shown in Tables 1 1 and 1 2.

The PET resin film used as a substrate was transparent and transmissivity of light within a visible light region was 87.9 . However since the film had no electric conductivity its surface resistance was infinite and was not measurable. Meanwhile in the case of a film formed on its surface a coated layer of multi layer graphenes by rubbing with the cluster of multi layer graphenes though its light transmissivity varies depending on the number of rubbing cycles sufficient electric conductivity was obtained with keeping light transmittance. Though the thickness of the coated layer of graphenes is very thin the surface resistance making it possible to use the film as electrical wiring was obtained.

Clusters of multi layer graphenes of Production Examples 2 1 to 2 6 and an artificial graphite material A IGS895 available from Nippon Techno Carbon Co. Ltd. and an artificial graphite material B MGY 72 available from TOHO CARBON CO. LTD. prepared in Production Example 2 were prepared as graphite materials. A true density an apparent density a bulk density and a total pore ratio thereof are shown in Table 2 1.

Substrates coated with multi layer graphenes were produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that these graphite materials were used. In any of productions the rubbing of the graphite material was carried out five times.

With respect to each of the graphite materials whether or not a coated layer of multi layer graphenes had been formed on the surface of the substrate was observed using an optical microscope. A light transmissivity and a surface resistance of the obtained substrate were measured. The results are shown in Tables 2 2 and 2 3.

In respect to the commercially available artificial graphite materials A and B a coated layer was not formed on the surface of the PET resin film at all and since no current flows in the film its surface resistance was infinite and was not measurable. Meanwhile in respect to the clusters of multi layer graphenes in the case of a true density of less than 1.85 g cm a coated layer of multi layer graphenes is hardly formed and for forming a coated layer it can be considered that it is necessary that a true density is approximately not less than 1.85 g cm and a total pore ratio is approximately not less than 40 . Further it can be considered that a good coated layer is formed and a uniform coating surface is obtained when a true density is approximately not less than 2.0 g cm and a total pore ratio is approximately not less than 50 . is an SEM of the surface of the coated layer of Example 2 4. In this figure partly separated multi layer graphenes in the form of flower leaf were observed.

A 300 m thick PET resin film a 500 m thick acrylic resin film a 200 m thick polystyrene resin film a 1 mm thick polycarbonate resin film a 50 m thick polypropylene resin film a 100 m thick polyethylene resin film a 50 m thick polyvinyl chloride resin film a 500 m thick Teflon trade mark resin film and a 500 m thick glass sheet were cut into a shape of 30 mm 30 mm respectively and the surfaces thereof were wiped with a swab impregnated with ethyl alcohol for cleaning and degreasing treatment to prepare substrates.

The surfaces of these substrates was treated in the same manner as in Example 1 using the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 to ascertain whether a coated layer of the multi layer graphenes was formed on the substrate. Number of rubbing cycles of the surface of the substrate with the cluster of multi layer graphenes was five times.

The surfaces of the obtained substrates were observed with an optical microscope and SEM to check to see whether a coated layer was formed and whether the surfaces were uniform. The results are shown in Table 3. The coated films of the multi layer graphenes were formed on the resins but not on the glass. Especially resins having electron bond of benzene nucleus double bond or the like in its molecular structure exhibited good formability of a coated layer. It can be considered that the reason for that is such that a more rigid Van der Waals bond is formed on the surfaces of these resins having electron due to overlapping with electron orbit of graphene. shows an SEM photograph of the surface of the coated layer of multi layer graphenes which was formed on the surface of the PET resin film and shows an SEM photograph of the surface of the coated layer of multi layer graphemes which was formed on the surface of the acrylic resin film.

A 300 m thick copper sheet a 70 m thick copper foil a 30 m thick aluminum foil and a 200 m thick titanium sheet were cut into a shape of 30 mm 30 mm respectively and a 125 m thick silicon wafer a 150 m thick SiC substrate a 125 m thick aluminum nitride substrate a 100 m thick GaN substrate a 125 m thick glassy carbon substrate and a 100 m thick sapphire substrate were cut into a shape of 50 mm diameter respectively and the surfaces thereof were wiped with a swab impregnated with ethyl alcohol for cleaning and degreasing treatment to prepare substrates.

The surfaces of these substrates were treated in the same manner as in Example 1 using the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 to ascertain whether a coated layer comprising the multi layer graphenes was formed on the substrate. Number of rubbing cycles of the surface of the substrate with the cluster of multi layer graphenes was five times.

The surfaces of the obtained substrates were observed with an optical microscope and SEM to check to see whether a coated layer was formed and whether the surfaces were uniform. The results are shown in Table 4. It was confirmed that the coated layers of multi layer graphenes were formed on the copper sheet copper foil aluminum foil titanium sheet glassy carbon substrate and sapphire substrate. Uniformity of the surface of the coated layer was most excellent in the copper sheet and the copper foil and the whole surfaces thereof were covered with multi layer graphenes. shows an SEM photograph of the surface of the coated layer of multi layer graphenes which was formed on the surface of the copper sheet.

The whole surface of a slide glass 26 mm wide 76 mm long 0.8 mm thick produced by Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd. was wiped with ethanol for cleaning and degreasing treatment. A polyester resin available from UNITIKA LTD. and an acrylic resin were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 1 and the mixture was dipped in N N dimethylformamide to prepare a solution having a resin concentration of 5000 ppm. The surface of the glass was coated with the resin using a micro speed dip coater available from SDI Company Ltd. at a temperature of 50 C. at a lift up speed of 10 m sec. The obtained resin coated glass was subjected to air drying for 24 hours to make a substrate for forming a coated layer of multi layer graphenes.

The surface of the substrates were treated in the same manner as in Example 3 using the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 and a coated layer of multi layer graphenes was formed and a transparent composite material composed of the glass resin and graphenes was obtained.

Three kinds of solvents i.e. water containing 0.1 wt of sodium lauryl sulfate water surfactant N N dimethylformamide DMF and 2 methoxyethanol were prepared. The cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 was weighed to be 0.1 wt to each of the solvents and after mixing with the solvent was subjected to shredding treatment at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes with a wet mixer having a metallic cutter thereby shredding the cluster of multi layer graphenes to obtain three kinds of dispersions of multi layer graphenes. Each dispersion was charged in a commercially available ultrasonic cleaner Portable ultrasonic cleaner W 113 available from HONDA ELECTRONICS and was subjected to application of ultrasonic wave at 42 kHz at an output of 100 W for 30 minutes. After the application of ultrasonic wave the solution turned black since multi layer graphenes in the form of flower leaf had been dispersed from the cluster of multi layer graphenes in the solvent. Then this dispersion was subjected to centrifugal separation at an acceleration rate of 800 G for 30 minutes a light black supernatant was collected as a dispersion for graphene dip coating.

A 300 m thick PET resin film and a 300 m thick copper sheet were cut into a shape of 20 mm wide 70 mm long to make substrates for dip coating.

The PET resin film and the copper sheet were subjected to dip coating using a micro speed dip coater available from SDI Company Ltd. under the conditions shown in Table 5 for forming a multi layer graphene coated layer on the surface of the substrate.

In the case of dip coating of the PET resin film using the solvent of water surfactant a coated layer of multi layer graphenes was not formed at a solution temperature of 40 C. even at a lift up speed of 10 m sec. At a solution temperature of 50 C. partial adhering of multi layer graphenes was recognized and at 60 C. a coated layer was formed stably. However at 80 C. the PET resin film was deformed due to heat. In the case of dip coating of the PET resin film using the solvent of 2 methoxyethanol the same tendency was observed. However even at a solution temperature of 40 C. a coated layer was formed and at 50 C. a coated layer was formed stably. In the case of dip coating of the copper sheet using the N N dimethlformamide solution even at 40 C. a coated layer was formed and at 50 C. a coated layer was formed stably and at 60 C. a uniformly coated surface was obtained.

In the case of the dip coating while a substrate was exposed to the air by coming out from an interface of a solvent and the air the substrate was dried by evaporation of the solvent and thereby multi layer graphenes dispersed in the solvent was laminated on the surface of the substrate and a coated layer was formed. In the case where a solution temperature was low it can be considered that an evaporation speed of the solvent was slow and smooth drying did not proceed at an interface between the solvent and the substrate and therefore graphenes dispersed in the solvent still remained in the solvent and stable formation did not occur.

The cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 11 was pulverized in an agate mortar and the pulverized sample was poured into dimethylformamide to prepare a solution mixed with graphite in an amount of 5 wt . After applying ultrasonic wave at a frequency of 42 kHz at an output of 100 W for 30 minutes with an ultrasonic cleaner W 113 available from HONDA ELECTRONICS a solid content was precipitated using a centrifugal separator at an acceleration rate of 700 G for 30 minutes The supernatant of the obtained solution was filtrated through a micro grid for TEM observation of graphenes having been dispersed in the solution and the components collected on the micro grid was subjected to TEM observation. As a result of the TEM observation the existence of many graphenes in the form of thin sheet multi layer graphenes was observed as shown in shows a lattice fringe image by TEM of the edge of the obtained multi layer graphenes in the form of thin sheet and about seven layers of graphene can be observed. From this it was confirmed that about 2.1 nm thick multi layer graphenes had been obtained.

Water containing 0.1 wt of sodium lauryl sulfate water surfactant was prepared and the same treatment as in Example 6 was carried out to obtain a dispersion of multi layer graphenes. The dispersion was used as a dispersion for spray coating of graphene.

A mini compressor TYPE 226 available from Kiso Power Tool Mfg. Co. Ltd. was prepared and connected to an air brush E1307N available from the same company. The dispersion was filled in a liquid vessel of the air brush and the air brush was adjusted so that the dispersion can be sprayed at an air pressure of 0.2 MPa. The inner diameter of the nozzle of the air brush was 0.4 mm. A PET resin film of 30 mm 30 mm 300 m thick was placed on a surface of a metal hot plate and the dispersion was sprayed onto the surface of the film to observe the surface. When the hot plate was not heated liquid droplets remain on the surface of the film and graphenes were not adhered to the surface of the film. However when the hot plate was heated to 60 C. graphenes were adhered to the surface of the film and a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes was obtained.

The cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 11 was cut into small pieces of about 3 to 5 mm with a cutter. A tool in which a pedestal having a disk like surface surface of tool having an outer diameter of 20 mm was jointed to a rotation shaft of 3 mm diameter 30 mm length made of steel was prepared and small pieces of multi layer graphenes were adhered to the surface of the tool The small pieces were not adhered to the portion in the range of about 9 mm diameter from the center of the tool surface . For the adhesion an epoxy resin based elastic adhesive EP001N available from CEMEDINE CO. LTD. was used. The tool was allowed to stand for 24 hours for sufficient hardening of adhesive. is a photograph showing an appearance of a completed graphene coating tool. It can be seen that the cluster of multi layer graphenes formed into small pieces is adhered to the surface of the tool. The prepared tool was fitted to a hobby router HR100 available from Ryobi Limited and pressed onto a PET resin film of 30 mm 30 mm 300 m thick for 3 minutes at a rotation control graduation 1 while moving over the whole surface of the film to give a substrate coated with multi layer graphenes.

The surface of a PET resin film of 120 m thick 150 mm wide 150 mm long was wiped with a swab impregnated with ethyl alcohol for cleaning and degreasing treatment to prepare a substrate. Also an aluminum sheet having a width of 160 mm a length of 160 mm and a thickness of 3 mm and fabricated so as to have circular holes having a diameter of 5 mm on the whole surface thereof with a center to center pitch of the holes being 9 mm was prepared as a transfer mold .

The aluminum sheet was placed on a hot plate the surface temperature of which was set at 70 C. and after holding for five minutes the back surface of the PET resin film was laid on the aluminum sheet and the outer periphery of the film was fixed with a heat resistant tape. While rubbing the surface of the PET resin film substrate with the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 13 the multi layer graphenes were coated so that the pattern of the transfer mold came up to the surface of the film. A period of time required for coating the whole surface of the substrate was about five minutes. After the coating 10 to 20 mm wide outer periphery portions of the PET resin film were cut off to remove defected portions such as portions damaged by the heat resistant tape. As a result the PET resin film having a pattern of thick and thin layers of multi layer graphenes multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern was obtained in which multi layer graphenes were coated in a thickness being as relatively thick as about 0.5 m on the portions of 130 mm wide 130 mm long 120 m thick except the circled hole portions of the transfer mold while on the film portions corresponding to the circled hole portions of the transfer mold multi layer graphenes were coated thin. is a photograph showing an appearance of the film.

With respect to the thus obtained multi layer graphene coated substrate with a pattern surface resistances of the portions coated thick with graphenes and the portions coated thin were measured three times respectively and average values were obtained. With respect to light transmission light transmissivity at each of wavelengths pf 400 nm 500 nm 600 nm and 700 nm was measured and average values were obtained.

The surface resistance average value of the portions coated thick was 800 and that of the portions coated thin was 85000 . The average light transmissivity with respect to visible light is 33.5 on the portions coated thick and that of the portions coated thin was 85 . Accordingly a transparent conductive film having a pattern of thick and thin layers of multi layer graphenes and being provided with light transmittance and conductivity over the whole surface of the film was obtained.

A copying paper having a thickness of about 90 m a whiteness of about 84 and a weight of 70 g m available from ASKUL CORPORATION trade name Multi Paper Super Select Smooth was cut into pieces of 150 mm wide 150 mm long to make a substrate. Also a 70 m thick polyester non woven fabric of polyester fibers having a diameter of 10 m was cut into pieces of 150 mm wide 150 mm long to make another substrate. Multi layer graphenes were coated on the surfaces of these substrates by rubbing the surfaces thereof with the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 13. The coating was repeated on each of the substrate surfaces until the resistance measured with a tester decreases under 1000 . The substrates were turned over and the same coating was also carried out on the back surfaces thereof. The coating on both front and back surfaces was carried out until the every resistance measured at ten points of the respective surfaces decrease under 1000 and electric conductivity is obtained on both surfaces. A period of time taken for processing was about 6 minutes in the copying paper and about 8 minutes in the polyester non woven fabric. The analog tester EAT 01B available from Asahi Electric Co. Ltd. was used as a tester.

SEM of the surface of multi layer graphenes coated on the copying paper is shown in and enlarged photograph of and SEM of the surface of multi layer graphenes coated on the polyester non woven fabric is shown in . The multi layer graphene coated substrates were obtained in which the multi layer graphenes were coated without a binder on the surfaces of cellulose fibers in the case of the paper and on the surfaces of polyester fibers in the case of the polyester non woven fabric.

 1 A 110 m thick polyester non woven fabric having a weight of 75 g mwas fixed onto a hot plate and the temperature of the hot plate was set at 80 C. The polyester non woven fabric was rubbed with the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 13 for lamination treated article 1 . 2 The treated article 1 was subjected to hot roll press at a feeding rate of 2 cm sec a load of 280 N and a roll temperature of 80 C. treated article 2 3 The treated article 2 was subjected to hot press at a hot plate temperature of 80 C. and a load of 10000 N for 10 minutes treated article 3 . 4 A thickness a bulk density and resistivity of each of the treated articles 1 to 3 were measured. A photograph showing appearances of the multi layer graphene coated substrates of the treated articles 1 to 3 is shown in . The treated article 1 showed a black appearance and the treated articles 2 and 3 showed a metallic gloss. The multi layer graphene coated substrate of the treated article 3 showed the most metallic gloss. The thicknesses of the treated articles 1 to 3 after the coating were 83 m 66 m and 61 m respectively and bulk densities thereof unit g cm calculated from their shapes and weights were 1.0 1.3 and 1.5 respectively. Thus high density was realized by roll press and hot press treatments. By the achievement of high density an intrinsic electric resistance was decreased and the intrinsic electric resistances of the treated articles 1 to 3 were 3.5 cm 1.5 cm and 0.1 cm. The measurement of the intrinsic electric resistance was carried out with a surface resistance meter Hiresta UP available from DIA Instruments Co. Ltd. . 5 The treated article 3 was cut into a disc having a diameter of 10 mm. A double pole cell was produced in a globe box filled with argon gas atmosphere by using a multi layer graphene coated substrate dried at 120 C. for one hour as a working electrode metallic lithium as a counter electrode and LiBF4 as an electrolytic solution and charge and discharge characteristics were measured at an electric potential within a range from 0 to 3 V at a current density of 40 mA g. The reversible capacitance and the coulomb efficiency which were measured at 35th cycle of charging and discharging were 210 mAh g and 90.1 respectively and thus the treated article 3 exhibited sufficient functions as a negative electrode material and a current collector for a lithium ion battery. 6 The thermal diffusivities of the treated articles 1 to 3 and the polyester non woven fabric were measured with the thermal diffusivity measuring equipment Model LaserPIT M2 available from ULVAC RIKO Inc. The thermal diffusivity 10m S of the polyester non woven fabric was 0.02 and in the treated articles 1 to 3 thermal diffusivities thereof were enhanced to 0.318 0.635 and 2.502 respectively. The obtained thermal diffusivity of the treated article 3 was about 100 times that of the polyester non woven fabric.

 1 A solvent of 2 propanol which was a reagent of special grade available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. was prepared. The weights of the solvent and the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 were measured so that the weight ratio of the cluster to the solvent would be 0.1 wt Then after mixing of them the mixture was subjected to shredding treatment at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes with a wet mixer having a metal cutter to shred the cluster of multi layer graphenes. After that the solution mixture was charged in a commercially available ultrasonic washer portable ultrasonic washer W 113 available from HONDA ELECTRONICS and subjected to application of ultrasonic wave at 42 kHz at an output of 100 W for 30 minutes. The solution mixture after the application of ultrasonic wave turned black since the multi layer graphenes in the form of flower leaves were dispersed in the solvent from the cluster of multi layer graphenes. Then this dispersion was subjected to centrifuging at an acceleration rate of 800 G for 30 minutes to remove the supernatant. The black residual was collected and 2 propanol was poured into the residual so that the amount of dispersed graphenes would be 30 wt followed by stirring to prepare a dispersion of residual graphenes. 2 A 110 m thick polyester non woven fabric E having a weight of 75 g mand a 50 m thick polyester non woven fabric F having a weight of 40 g mwere prepared and were placed on a hot plate having been set to 80 C. After coating the dispersion of residual graphenes prepared in 1 above by hand hot roll press was carried out at a feeding speed of 1 cm sec at a load of 500 N at a roll temperature of 80 C. and then hot press treatment was carried out at a heated plate temperature of 80 C. at a load of 10000 N for 10 minutes. The resistances on the coated surface and the back surface thereof were measured with a surface resistance meter Hiresta UP available from DIA Instruments Co. Ltd. . In the case of the non woven fabric E the resistance measured on the coated surface was 10 cm and the resistance on back surface could not be measured the electric resistance was too large and exceeded the measurable range of the meter . Thus the electrically conductive sheet having thermal conductivity while the other surface of which was an insulating surface was obtained by using the thick non woven fabric. In the case of the non woven fabric F the resistances thereof were measured in the same manner. The resistances of the both surfaces were less than 0.1 cm and the bulk density was increased up to 1.7.

 1 A solvent of 2 propanol which was a reagent of special grade available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. was prepared. The weights of the solvent and the cluster of multi layer graphenes obtained in Production Example 1 were measured so that the weight ratio of the cluster to the solvent would be 0.1 wt . Then after mixing of them the mixture was subjected to shredding treatment at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes with a wet mixer having a metal cutter to shred the cluster of multi layer graphenes. After that the solution mixture was charged in a commercially available ultrasonic washer portable ultrasonic washer W 113 available from HONDA ELECTRONICS and subjected to application of ultrasonic wave at 42 kHz at an output of 100 W for 30 minutes. The solution mixture after the application of ultrasonic wave turned black since the multi layer graphenes in the form of flower leaves were dispersed in the solvent from the cluster of multi layer graphenes. Then this dispersion was subjected to centrifuging at an acceleration rate of 800 G for 30 minutes. The supernatant was collected and a dispersion of multi layer graphenes having an amount of dispersed graphenes of 0.05 mg ml was obtained. 2 The mini compressor type 226 available from KISO POWER TOOL MFG. CO. LTD. was prepared and connected to the air brush E1307N available from the same company. The dispersion of multi layer graphenes prepared in 1 above was charged in the liquid vessel of the air brush and the pressure inside the vessel was adjusted with an air pressure of 0.2 MPa so that the dispersion could gushed out. The inner diameter of the nozzle of the air brush was 0.4 mm. A 100 m thick PET film of 50 mm square was placed on the surface of a metallic hot plate having been set to 80 C. a distance between the air brush and the substrate was set to 110 mm and the 20 ml of dispersion was sprayed onto the film. After the spray coating roll press was carried out at a load of 400 N between the rolls set to 120 C. and then 5 minute hot press was conducted with a heated plate set to 140 C. at a load of 10000 N. The resistances on the surface of the laminated film of multi layer graphenes after the spray coating and the hot press were measured with Hiresta UP available from DIA Instruments Co. Ltd. and light transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm was measured with a visible ultraviolet spectrophotometer Aurius CE2021 available from CECIL . The light transmittance immediately after the spray coating was 70 and the surface resistance was 8000000 and after the hot press the light transmittance was decreased to 55 but the surface resistance was decreased to 1500 . The surface of the film after the spray coating and further after carrying out the hot roll press and the hot press was observed with FE SEM the film after the spray coating the film after carrying out the hot roll press and the hot press . The state of graphenes being wholly agglomerated was observed but by carrying out the hot roll treatment and the hot press treatment the graphenes were adhered flatly on the film contact points between the graphenes increased and formation of a conductive path was accelerated.

Single fluid spray coating was carried out using the dispersion of multi layer graphenes prepared in 1 of Example 14 with a precision dispenser for ejecting a trace amount of the dispersion from the inside of a cylinder through a nozzle having a fine tip by an air pressure. Namely a trace amount of solution droplets having a size of about 500 m were dropped on a heated substrate at an interval of 0.5 mm using a nozzle having an inner diameter of 100 m while adjusting an opening closing time and a distance of a solenoid valve and an applying air pressure for supplying the dispersion. A PET film or a copper sheet was used as a substrate and the heating temperature was 90 C. The state of the surface of each of the substrates where the dispersion was dropped was observed with FE SEM state of the surface of the PET film enlarged photograph of a state of the surface of the copper sheet enlarged photograph of a . Many portions where thin graphenes having a size of about 10 m had been coated while shrinking in the form of roll were observed. Since in the two liquid spray coating in Example 14 etc. such thin graphenes were not observed it can be considered that in the two liquid method most of thin graphenes had been blown off due to the air flow. On the contrary it was confirmed that the single liquid method was a process suitable for coating thin graphenes since nearly the whole ejected liquid droplets arrived at the surface of the substrate or film.

A PET resin an average particle size of 3 mm in the form of pellet was pre baked at a maximum ultimate temperature of 600 C. under inert gas atmosphere. An amount of hydrogen remaining in the starting material after the pre baking was 22000 ppm. The pre baked starting material was charged in a screw capped triangular screw graphite crucible made of a material having a bulk density of 1.80 and an open pore ratio of 10 and a screw type top cover was turned to be closed and thus the crucible containing the pre baked starting material was sealed. After charging the graphite crucible in hot isostatic pressing equipment a temperature and pressure inside the equipment were increased to 600 C. and 70 MPa respectively in one hour using argon gas and thereafter heating at a temperature elevating rate of 500 C. per hour and increase in a pressure were continued to reach a maximum ultimate pressure of 190 MPa and a maximum ultimate temperature of 1500 C. Then the maximum ultimate temperature and pressure were maintained for one hour and the temperature was reduced to room temperature and the pressure was decreased. The sample obtained after the treatment was a cluster of multi layer graphenes true density 2.08 apparent density 1.33 bulk density 0.75 total pore ratio 63.9 .

Each of samples Production Examples 2 1 to 2 6 was obtained by treating in the same manner as in Production Example 1 except that a phenol formaldehyde resin an average particle size of 20 m was used instead of a PET resin as a starting material and that the treating conditions shown in Table 6 were used.

A powder of phenol formaldehyde resin having an average particle size of 20 m was pre baked at each of maximum ultimate temperatures of 600 C. 700 C. 900 C. and 1000 C. under inert gas atmosphere. An amount of hydrogen remaining in the starting material after the pre baking was analyzed and the results are shown in Table 7. The starting material pre baked at each temperature was charged in a screw capped triangular screw graphite crucible made of a material having a bulk density of 1.80 and an open pore ratio of 10 and a threaded top cover was turned to be closed and thus the crucible containing the pre baked starting material was sealed. After charging the graphite crucible in hot isostatic pressing equipment a temperature and pressure inside the equipment were increased to 600 C. and 70 MPa respectively in one hour using argon gas and thereafter heating at a temperature elevating rate of 500 C. per hour and increase in a pressure were continued to reach a maximum ultimate pressure of 190 MPa and each of maximum ultimate temperatures of 1400 C. 1800 C. 2000 C. and 2500 C. Then the maximum ultimate temperature and pressure were maintained for one hour and the temperature was reduced to room temperature and the pressure was decreased. A period of time required from charging of the graphite crucible up to taking out thereof was 8 to 12 hours. A bulk density a pore ratio and a true density of the treated sample were measured and the results are shown in Table 7.

As shown in Table 7 in the case of a pre baking temperature of 600 C. and an amount of remaining hydrogen of 20000 ppm measured by the above mentioned measuring method a true density being most approximate to a theoretical density of graphite was obtained Production Examples 3 1 and 3 2 and as a pre baking temperature increased a value of a true density decreased Production Examples 3 3 and 3 4 . In the case of a pre baking temperature of 900 C. and an amount of remaining hydrogen of 5000 ppm measured by the above mentioned measuring method a true density was 1.88 Production Example 3 4 . In the case of a pre baking temperature of 900 C. or 1000 C. and a maximum ultimate temperature of 2000 C. or 2500 C. at the hot isostatic pressing treatment any of true densities are less than 2.0. is an electron micrograph of a surface of the sample of Production Example 3 1 and is an expanded electron micrograph of the surface of . is an electron micrograph of a broken surface of the sample of Production Example 3 1 and graphenes are vapor grown radially on a surface of the spherical pre baked starting material.

A powder of phenol formaldehyde resin having an average particle size of 500 m was pre baked at a maximum ultimate temperature of 600 C. under inert gas atmosphere. The pre baked starting material was treated in the same manner as in Production Example 3 except that a maximum ultimate temperature during the hot isostatic pressing treatment was 1400 C.
