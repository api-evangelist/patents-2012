The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to molding processes and more particularly to a mold release process for use with cold spraying.

There are many different types of additive manufacturing processes such as thermal spray cold spray laser forming casting and the like in which the manufactured parts are produced using a mold or die. For example in one known method molten material is deposited onto or into a mold and upon cooling solidifies to form the desired part. The mold must then be removed from the part.

There are many known different ways for separating the part from the mold. For example in some known methods the mold with the formed part is immersed in a chemical bath which dissolves the mold but not the part. In other cases the mold is mechanically machined away from the formed part. In both cases however the mold or die is destroyed during the process of separating it from the formed part.

A still further known method of casting parts is known as the lost wax process. In the lost wax process the mold is comprised of a low melting material i.e. the wax that is formed into a negative image of the desired finished part. That wax negative image is then immersed into a ceramic slurry which coats the entire mold surface except for sprue openings with the ceramic slurry which is then allowed to dry and harden. That process is repeated until there is a sufficient buildup of hardened ceramic coating surrounding the surface of the wax negative image.

The coated mold is then placed into an oven which heats the mold and the wax to a temperature sufficient to melt the wax which is then removed from the mold leaving the image of the desired part. The part material is then introduced into the mold cavity and upon cooling the part is formed.

The process of cold spraying also known as gas dynamic cold spray also presents unique problems in molding parts. In a cold spray process the part material in powder form is directed at high speed against the mold surface. Due to the high velocity of the part material at impact against the mold surface the part material fuses together and solidifies by a cold forming solid state operation. After sufficient material has been deposited on the mold surface the mold must be removed in order to obtain the desired manufactured part.

Previously during the cold spray process the part material adheres and bonds to the mold surface. Consequently in order to extract the part from the mold it has been previously necessary to either mechanically machine away the mold from the finished part or chemically dissolve the mold. In either case however the mold cannot be reused since it is destroyed during the removal process. This in turn increases the overall cost of molding parts using the cold spray process.

The present invention provides a method for making parts using the cold spray process which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the known methods.

In brief in the method of the present invention a mold is first formed so that the mold has a negative shape of the desired finished part. The mold may be constructed of any suitable material such as metal synthetics and the like.

The mold surface is then coated with a release agent. Preferably the release agent comprises a metal which is itself deposited on the mold surface using the cold spray process. This release agent furthermore forms a thin layer between the mold surface and the finished part and thus duplicates the shape of the mold surface.

Thereafter part material is deposited on the release agent on the mold surface by utilizing a cold spray process. The overall temperature of the mold during the cold spray operation is relatively low typically less than 300 Fahrenheit.

It is important that the release agent be compatible with both the mold as well as the part material. Specifically the release agent must be compatible with the mold so that the release agent will adhere to the mold to permit the subsequent cold spray process of the part material. Similarly the release agent must not only adhere to the part material but must be of sufficient toughness to avoid cracking or other deformations during the cold spray operation of the part material against the release agent.

After a sufficient amount of part material has been deposited on the release agent in the mold the release agent must be removed from both the mold and the finished part. Different methods may be used to achieve this separation.

First the release agent may be selected such that it has a lower melting temperature than both the material forming the mold and also the melting temperature of the part material. Consequently following formation of the part by using the cold spray process the mold release agent and finished part are heated in any appropriate fashion such as an oven to a temperature above the melting material of the release agent but less than the melting temperature of the mold material and part material. Once the release agent melts the finished part may be easily removed from the mold while retaining the mold intact for subsequent molding operations.

Alternatively in order to separate the finished part from the mold while retaining the mold intact for subsequent use a chemical solvent is applied to the part mold and the release agent. This solvent is selected so that it dissolves the release agent but not the mold or the part material. Consequently upon immersion of the mold release agent and finished part into a bath of the solvent after time the solvent dissolves the release agent thus separating the finished part from the mold.

A still further method to separate the finished part from the mold while retaining the mold intact is to select a release agent that forms only a weak mechanical bond with both the mold as well as the part material. This bond must be sufficient to adhere to both the mold and the part material to allow the formation of the part using the cold spray process but sufficiently weak so that the release agent may be mechanically separated e.g. by pressing the release agent from the finished part and mold following the cold spray operation.

With reference first to a portion of an exemplary mold is shown having a mold surface . The mold surface is a negative image of the desired finished part. Furthermore the mold may be constructed of any suitable material such as metal composites and the like.

Still referring to a release agent is applied to the mold surface so that the release agent forms a thin coating on the mold surface . Since the release agent constitutes only a thin coating the actual shape of the mold surface is duplicated by the release agent .

The release agent is selected so that it is compatible with the mold . That compatibility requires that the release agent adhere to the mold during a cold spray operation.

The release agent may be applied to the mold surface of the mold by any conventional method. However in embodiments of the invention the coating of the release agent is applied to the mold surface using a cold spray operation illustrated diagrammatically by a cold spray high speed nozzle in .

With reference now to in order to form a finished part the part material is deposited over the coating of the release agent by the cold spray process so that the deposited part material also assumes the shape of the mold surface . During the cold spray operation the mold temperature may reach temperatures as high as 300 Fahrenheit due to the high speed impact of the part material against the mold surface covered with the release agent .

It is important that the release agent be compatible with the part material . Specifically the release agent must be of sufficient toughness and durability that it resists cracking or deformation from the part material during the cold spray operation. In addition the part material must also adhere to the release agent .

Following the cold spray process to form the finished part the finished part must be removed from the mold without destruction of the mold during that removal process. This can be achieved in any of several ways.

First the release agent may be thermally removed from both the part and the mold . In order to accomplish this the material for the release agent is selected such that it has a melting temperature lower than the melting temperature of both the mold and the material of the finished part but sufficiently high to resist deformation or destruction during the cold spray process. For example assuming that the mold is constructed of a material with a high melting temperature e.g. steel and the finished part is made of copper zinc could be chosen as the material for the release agent . Zinc is compatible with the both the mold material and the finished part material i.e. it will adhere to both and is also sufficiently tough that it will withstand deformation or cracking during the cold spray process of the copper against the layer of the release agent .

Just as importantly zinc has a relatively low melting temperature of approximately 787 Fahrenheit. Thus the melting temperature of zinc is much less than steel and less than the melting temperature of copper. However the melting temperature of approximately 787 Fahrenheit for zinc is still well above the temperatures generated by the cold spray process.

After the zinc has been sprayed on the mold to form the release agent layer and copper sprayed onto the release agent layer to form the finished part the mold finished part and release agent are heated to a temperature above the melting temperature of zinc but less than the melting temperature of both the mold and the finished part . Consequently as shown in the release agent will melt and flow away from both the mold and finished part . After the release agent has been completely melted from between the finished part and the mold the finished part can be easily retrieved. Since the mold remains undamaged during the entire molding operation the mold may also be reused in subsequent molding operations.

An alternative method of separating the mold from the finished part following the cold spray operation of the finished part material onto the mold is to chemically dissolve the release agent with a solvent. In this method of separating the finished part from the mold the material for the release agent is selected so that it dissolves when immersed in a particular chemical solvent but both the mold and the finished part are unaffected i.e. do not dissolve when immersed into the solvent.

For example assuming that it is desired to produce a tantalum part on a ceramic mold aluminum could be selected as the release agent. The aluminum is then applied to the mold surface on the ceramic mold using the cold spray process. Tantalum is then sprayed on the aluminum layer of the aluminum release agent on the mold surface.

The resulting mold release agent and finished part are then immersed in a bath of solvent containing sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide will attack and dissolve the aluminum but does not dissolve either tantalum or ceramic. Consequently upon the complete dissolution of the aluminum release agent the finished part is completely separated from the mold and the mold can be used to manufacture subsequent parts.

A still further method for separating the finished part from the mold is to select the material for the release agent that forms only a weak mechanical bond between the mold and the finished part material during the cold spray process. For example aluminum can be sprayed against the mold surface to form the release agent and tantalum can be sprayed onto the aluminum release agent to form the finished part. Aluminum however forms only a weak mechanical bond with both the mold as well as the finished part so that the finished part may be mechanically removed from the mold without damaging the mold . Any conventional mechanism may be used to apply the mechanical force such as pressing to separate the finished part from the mold .

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple yet highly effective method for forming finished parts using the cold spray operation and which avoids destruction of the mold in order to separate the finished part from the mold. Having described our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
