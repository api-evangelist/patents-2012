This invention was made with government support under SBIR Grant No. EY016262 awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America National Institutes of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.

RdCVF is a thioredoxin like protein specifically expressed by rod photoreceptor cells in the retina L veillard et al. 2004 Nature Genetics 36 755 759 and the supplemental information . Two different RdCVF genes are found in humans and they are designated RdCVF1 and RdCVF2. Both RdCVF genes encode two products via alternative splicing a full length protein and a C terminal post transcriptionally truncated protein known as RdCVF long and RdCVF short respectively.

RdCVF short is described as a secreted trophic factor for promoting cone survival and RdCVF Long as a redox active enzyme that interacts with intracellular proteins L veillard et al. 2010 Sci Transl Med. 2 26 26ps16 . For example tau is described as a binding partner for RdCVF L and tau is exclusively intracellular Fridlich et al. 2009 Molecular Cellular Proteomics 8 6 1206 18 .

Individuals suffering from some retinal dystrophies were found to have lower levels of RdCVF protein in their eyes than did individuals without retinal dystrophies PCT Publication WO02 081513 .

It has been demonstrated that different forms of RdCVF protein can promote cone photoreceptor cell survival in vitro and in vivo. For example intraocular injections of the short form of human RdCVF1 RdCVF1S protein not only rescued cone cells from degeneration but also preserved their function in animal models of inherited retinal degeneration Yang et al. 2009 Mol Therapy 17 787 795 . However demonstration of the in vivo cone cell protective effect of this protein required using multiple intraocular injections.

Expression of significant levels of RdCVF at large scale and from gene therapy vectors has been challenging e.g. see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20110034546 paragraph 0004 .

It has been demonstrated that an RdCVF protein can promote cone photoreceptor cell survival in vitro and in vivo. For example intraocular injections of the short form of human RdCVF1 RdCVF1S protein not only rescued cone cells from degeneration but also preserved their function in animal models of inherited retinal degeneration. Yang et al. Mol Therapy 2009 17 787 795 and the supplemental material . RdCVF is expressed by several cell types including rod photoreceptor cells in the retina L veillard et al. 2004 Nature Genetics 36 755 759 .

Two different RdCVF genes are found in humans and other mammals and they are designated RdCVF1 and RdCVF2. Both RdCVF genes encode two products via alternative splicing a full length protein and a C terminal truncated protein known as RdCVF long and RdCVF short respectively.

In some embodiments the invention includes a recoded RdCVF coding sequence. A recoded RdCVF coding sequence can encode for any RdCVF protein including any of those disclosed herein. Sequences for various RdCVF proteins can be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO2002081513 and WO2010029130 Channel et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2007 8 74 pp 1 12 and the supplemental information L veillard et al. Nature Genetics 2004 36 755 759 and the supplemental information Yang et al.

For clarity all of these GenBank sequences as well as all other patent and non patent publications discussed herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. 

In some embodiments an RdCVF protein is a fragment or an analog of an RdCVF protein that retains a cone cell and or a rod cell survival activity or protective effect. Methods for measuring these activities or effects are known in the art. For example L veillard et al. Nature Genetics 2004 36 755 759 and the supplemental information describes related mouse models and in vitro methods for detecting RdCVF activity. An RdCVF protein or an RdCVF coded for by a nucleic acid can have an amino acid sequence other than a naturally occurring amino acid sequence. For example an RdCVF protein that is not naturally occurring may contain amino acids in addition to those found in a naturally occurring RdCVF protein e.g. at the amino or carboxy terminus and or may contain single or multiple amino acid substitutions e.g. conservative or non conservative amino acid substitutions as compared to a naturally occurring RdCVF amino acid sequence. A conservative amino acid substitution generally should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence e.g. a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence . Examples of art recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles Creighton Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company New York 1984 Introduction to Protein Structure C. Branden and J. Tooze eds. Garland Publishing New York N.Y. 1991 and Thornton et al. Nature 354 105 1991 . Conservative substitutions include but are not limited to those from the following groupings Acidic Residues Asp D and Glu E Basic Residues Lys K Arg R and His H Hydrophilic Uncharged Residues Ser S Thr T Asn N and Gln Q Aliphatic Uncharged Residues Gly G Ala A Val V Leu L and Ile I Non polar Uncharged Residues Cys C Met M and Pro P Aromatic Residues Phe F Tyr Y and Trp W Alcohol group containing residues S and T Aliphatic residues I L V and M Cycloalkenyl associated residues F H W and Y Hydrophobic residues A C F G H I L M R T V W and Y Negatively charged residues D and E Polar residues C D E H K N Q R S and T Positively charged residues H K and R Small residues A C D G N P S T and V Very small residues A G and S Residues involved in turn formation A C D E G H K N Q R S P and T and Flexible residues Q T K S G P D E and R. In some embodiments of the invention a non naturally occurring RdCVF protein has additional amino acids at the amino terminus e.g. additional amino acids from a heterologous signal peptide. In some embodiments an RdCVF protein of the invention is initially translated from a nucleotide coding sequence with a signal peptide and in some cases all or part of the amino acids of the signal peptide are retained on an expressed and or secreted RdCVF protein of the invention.

The term recoded or recoded nucleotide sequence means that at least one native codon is changed to a different codon that encodes for the same amino acid as the native codon. In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding region has at least 2.5 at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least or at least 95 of the codons recoded. In some embodiments about 20 50 35 45 38 42 or 39 41 or the codons are recoded. In some embodiments a recoded codon is replaced with a codon that is more prevalently used in humans. In some embodiments at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 or at least 55 of the codons have been replaced with a codon that is more prevalently used in humans.

In some embodiments a recoded sequence has between about 70 90 about 75 85 about 80 85 or about 82 85 identity with the corresponding native coding sequence. In some embodiments a recoded nucleotide sequence has at least 15 of the nucleotides different as compared to a corresponding native nucleotide sequence. In some embodiments a recoded nucleotide sequence is less than 90 identical to a corresponding native nucleotide sequence.

Recoding can also be used to change the chemical make up of a DNA and or an RNA coding sequence such as the guanine cytosine GC percentage. In some embodiments recoding of an RdCVF coding region raises the GC content to at least 60 . In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding region has a GC percentage between 60 64 or 60.4 63.5 .

Recoding can be used to change the secondary structure of mRNA. Recoding can also be used to remove or add particular motifs or sites to a coding sequence or nucleic acid molecule such as procarya inhibitory motifs consensus splice donor sites cryptic splice donor sites or a combination thereof. In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding sequence has less procarya inhibitory motifs consensus splice donor sites cryptic splice donor sites or a combination thereof than the native sequence. In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding sequence contains no procarya inhibitory motifs no consensus splice donor sites and or no cryptic splice donor sites.

In some embodiments of the invention a recoded RdCVF coding sequence does not contain the initial RdCVF ATG codon and or RdCVF stop codon e.g. TAG . For example an RdCVF recoded coding sequence can be operatively linked 5 or 3 to another coding sequence resulting in a protein comprising a heterologous amino acid sequence N terminal and or C terminal to the RdCVF amino acid sequence respectively. In some of these embodiments the initial RdCVF ATG codon and or RdCVF stop codon may be deleted or present in the RdCVF coding region. For example see SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 3. If another coding sequence is fused in frame at the 3 end of an RdCVF coding region then the native RdCVF stop codon will not typically be present at the end of the RdCVF coding sequence.

In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding region comprises nucleotides 106 to 741 of SEQ ID NO 1 nucleotides 106 to 429 of SEQ ID NO 1 nucleotides 106 to 432 of SEQ ID NO 3 or nucleotides 106 to 744 of SEQ ID NO 3.

In some embodiments a recoded RdCVF coding sequence is a recoded sequence that codes for amino acids 36 246 of SEQ ID NO 2

In some embodiments a coding sequence of the invention codes for a protein containing a signal sequence.

Signal sequences are translated in frame as a peptide attached typically to the amino terminal end of a polypeptide of choice. A secretory signal sequence will cause the secretion of the polypeptide from the cell by interacting with the machinery of the host cell. As part of the secretory process this secretory signal sequence will typically be cleaved off or at least partially cleaved off. The term signal sequence also refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding the signal peptide. In some embodiments a signal sequence is heterologous as compared to a particular RdCVF.

The structure of a typical signal peptide can include three distinct regions i an N terminal region that contains a number of positively charged amino acids e.g. lysines and arginines ii a central hydrophobic core region h region iii a hydrophilic cleavage region c region that contains the sequence motif recognized by the signal peptidase. e.g. see von Heijne G. 1983 Eur. J. Biochem. 133 17 21 von Heijne G. 1985 J. Mol. Biol. 184 99 105 von Heijne G. 1997 Protein Engineering 10 1 6 . Examples of proteins with signal peptides that can be used in the invention include but are not limited to human growth hormone HGH bone morphogenetic protein 7 BMP7 bone morphogenetic protein 2 BMP2 ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF insulin growth factor 1 IGF 1 glucoronidase GUSB glial cell derived neurotrophic factor GDNF hepatocyte growth factor HGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF leukemia inhibitory factor LIF immunoglobulin proteins bovine growth hormone bovine proalbumin human proinsulin human interferon gamma. human alpha fibrinogen human IgG heavy chain rat amylase murine alpha fetoprotein chicken lysozyme human placental alkaline phosphatase and rein protein 22.1. These signal peptides can be used in accordance with the invention. In some embodiments a signal peptide used in accordance with the invention is selected from the group consisting of HGH BDNF IGF 1 and GUSB. In some embodiments the signal peptide is from an immunoglobulin such as an IgK.

A signal sequence can be a mammalian murine or human signal sequence. In some embodiments a nucleic acid or vector of the invention comprises nucleotides 1 105 of SEQ ID NO 1 or 4 105 of SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments a signal sequence codes for an amino acid sequence comprising amino acids 2 34 of SEQ ID NO 2 or comprises SEQ ID NO 15. A nucleotide sequence coding for a signal peptide can be a wild type sequence or it can be a recoded sequence.

In some embodiments of the invention a signal peptide sequence is encoded for the N terminal or C terminal of an RdCVF. In some embodiments the signal peptide directs transit of the protein to secretory pathways e.g. to the endoplasmic reticulum ER . In some embodiments a signal peptide facilitates protein transport from the cytoplasm to destinations outside the cell. Signal peptide sequences may be selected from naturally occurring signal peptide sequences derivatives thereof or a synthetic designed sequence. In some embodiments non limiting parameters for a designed signal peptide sequences include a sequence of 3 40 residues comprising a 3 to 20 residue hydrophobic core flanked by several relatively hydrophilic residues.

In some embodiments a signal peptide sequence lacks a hydrophobic core. Non limiting examples of mammalian secretory proteins that lack a typical hydrophobic signal sequence that can be used in the invention include but are not limited to human IL 1 IL1 bFGF aFGF PDEGF anticoagulant protein lectin L 14 ATL derived factor Factor XIIIa Anchorin CII lipocortin I parathymosin prothymosin and rodent transglutaminase parathymosin and MDGI.

The invention includes nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an RdCVF and includes vectors comprising these nucleic acids.

To ensure local and or long term expression of a nucleic acid of interest some embodiments of the invention contemplate transducing a cell with a nucleic acid or vector encoding an RdCVF. The instant invention is not to be construed as limited to any one particular nucleic delivery method and any available nucleic acid delivery vehicle with either an in vivo or in vitro nucleic acid delivery strategy or the use of manipulated cells such as the technology of Neurotech Lincoln R.I. e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 231 879 6 262 034 6 264 941 6 303 136 6 322 804 6 436 427 6 878 544 as well as nucleic acids of the invention encoding an RdCVF per se e.g. naked DNA can be used in the practice of the invention. Various delivery vehicles such as vectors can be used with the invention. For example viral vectors amphitrophic lipids cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine PEI and polylysine dendrimers such as combburst molecules and starburst molecules nonionic lipids anionic lipids vesicles liposomes and other synthetic nucleic acid means of delivery e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 958 325 and 7 098 030 Langer Science 249 1527 1533 1990 Treat et al. in Liposomes in The Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer and Lopez Berestein Fidler eds. Liss New York pp. 317 327 and 353 365 1989 naked nucleic acids and so on can be used in the practice of the instant invention.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid molecule is used in which the RdCVF coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the RdCVF nucleic acid Koller et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 Zijlstra et al. 1989 Nature 342 435 438 . Delivery of a nucleic acid into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vector or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acid in vitro then transplanted into the patient.

A vector is a means by which a nucleic acid of interest e.g. a therapeutic nucleic acid that can encode a therapeutic protein is introduced into a target cell of interest. Methods for obtaining or constructing a vector of interest include but are not limited to standard gene manipulation techniques sequencing reactions restriction enzymes digests polymerase reactions PCR PCR SOEing ligations recombinase reactions e.g. Invitrogen s GATEWAY technology other enzymes active on nucleic acids bacteria and virus propagation materials and methods chemicals and reagents site directed mutagenesis protocols and so on as known in the art see for example the Maniatis et al. text Molecular Cloning. 

Nucleic acids of the invention will typically comprise a promoter sequence operatively linked to an RdCVF coding sequence. A promoter may be a tissue specific promoter a cell specific promoter an inducible promoter a repressible promoter a constitutive promoter a synthetic promoter or a hybrid promoter for example. Examples of promoters useful in the constructs of the invention include but are not limited to a phage lambda PL promoter an SV40 early promoter a herpes simplex viral HSV promoter a cytomegalovirus CMV promoter such as the human CMV immediate early promoter a hybrid promoter with CMV enhancer and chicken beta actin promoter a tetracycline controlled trans activator responsive promoter tet system a long terminal repeat LTR promoter such as a MoMLV LTR BIV LTR or an HIV LTR a U3 region promoter of Moloney murine sarcoma virus a Granzyme A promoter a regulatory sequence s of the metallothionein gene a CD34 promoter a CD8 promoter a thymidine kinase TK promoter a B19 parvovirus promoter a PGK promoter a glucocorticoid promoter a heat shock protein HSP promoter such as HSP65 and HSP70 promoters an immunoglobulin promoter an MMTV promoter a Rous sarcoma virus RSV promoter a lac promoter a CaMV 35S promoter and a nopaline synthetase promoter. In some embodiments a promoter is an MND promoter Robbins et al. 1997 J. Virol. 71 9466 9474 or an MNC promoter which is a derivative of the MND promoter in which the LTR enhancers are combined with a minimal CMV promoter Haberman et al. J. Virol. 74 18 8732 8739 2000 . In some embodiments an RdCVF coding sequence is operatively linked to a promoter sequence comprising nucleotide sequence 150 812 of SEQ ID NO 11.

In some embodiments a vector or nucleic acid of the invention comprises an intron operatively linked to a coding sequence for an RdCVF protein. An intron can be from an RdCVF gene or be a heterologous intron. Heterologous introns are known and non limiting examples include a human globin gene intron and a beta actin intron. In some embodiments an intron sequence is a human globin gene intron sequence. In some embodiments an intron sequence comprises nucleotides 820 1312 of SEQ ID NO 11 or 908 1307 of SEQ ID NO 11.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid of the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a coding sequence for an RdCVF protein wherein the RdCVF coding sequence comprises a recoded nucleotide sequence. A nucleic acid can encode for an RdCVF1 protein and or an RdCVF2 protein. In some embodiments an RdCVF protein is a short version RdCVF protein. In some embodiments an RdCVF protein is a long version RdCVF protein. For clarity an RdCVF protein can be an RdCVF1 short RdCVF1 long RdCVF2 short or RdCVF2 long protein. In some embodiments the RdCVF protein is a human RdCVF protein.

Typically a mammalian nucleotide coding region starts with the nucleotide sequence ATG initiating methionine codon such as found in a human RdCVF coding region. As discussed herein some embodiments of the invention provide a recoded RdCVF coding region and in some further embodiments the coding region is fused in frame with a second coding region e.g. a coding sequence for a signal sequence. In some of these cases the ATG nucleotide sequence is not necessarily at the start of the RdCVF coding region e.g. the RdCVF coding region starts by coding for the second amino acid of the particular RdCVF protein. However the ATG nucleotide sequence can be at the start of the RdCVF coding region even when the RdCVF coding region is operatively linked to another coding region 5 to the RdCVF coding region.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid of the invention comprises SEQ ID NOs 1 3 or 11. In some embodiments a nucleic acid of the invention comprises nucleotides 150 812 820 1312 and 1340 2080 of SEQ ID NO 11. In some embodiments a nucleic acid of the invention comprises nucleotides 150 812 908 1307 and 1340 2080 of SEQ ID NO 11. In some embodiments a nucleic acid further comprises nucleotides 2130 2608 of SEQ ID NO 11.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid of the invention comprises a coding region for an RdCVF wherein the RdCVF coding sequence has been recoded.

In some embodiments of the invention a nucleic of the invention is in a vector such as a viral vector.

The invention includes viral vectors comprising an RdCVF coding region of the invention. Examples of viral vectors useful in the present invention are described in PCT Publication No. WO08 106 644 and U.S. Patent Publication No. US20100120665. In some embodiments the invention is not limited to a particular viral vector. Viral vectors include but are not limited to retroviral vectors lentiviral vectors adenoviral vectors see for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 045 344 AAV vectors e.g. see U.S. Pat. No. 7 105 345 Herpes viral vectors e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 830 727 and 6 040 172 hepatitis e.g. hepatitis D viral vectors e.g. see U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments a lentiviral vector is an HIV EIAV SIV FIV or BIV vector. In some embodiments a vector is selected from an AAV vector or an adenoviral vector. The invention also provides a cell that produces a viral vector of the invention.

Vector virions of the invention may be administered in vivo or in vitro to cells e.g. mammalian cells . Vectors viral or nonviral can be used to transduce or transform cells including but not limited to undifferentiated cells differentiated cells somatic cells primitive cells and or stem cells. In some embodiments stem cells are intended for administration to a human and not for implantation in a suitably pseudopregnant woman for differentiation and development into an infant.

In some embodiments a viral vector of the invention comprises a decay accelerating factor DAF . For example an enveloped viral vector includes a DAF on the viral membrane. In some embodiments a DAF is a wild type DAF. In some embodiments a DAF is part of a fusion protein with an envelope protein e.g. see Guibinga et al. Mol Ther. 2005 11 4 645 51.

Adenovirus is a non enveloped nuclear DNA virus with a genome typically of about 36 kb. The human adenoviruses are divided into numerous serotypes approximately 47 numbered accordingly and classified into 6 groups A B C D E and F .

Recombinant adenoviral vectors have tropism for both dividing and non dividing cells minimal pathogenic potential ability to replicate to high titer for preparation of vector stocks and the potential to carry relatively large nucleotide sequence inserts Berkner 1992 Curr. Top. Micro. Immunol. 158 39 66 Jolly 1994 Cancer Gene Therapy 1 51 64 . Adenoviral vectors with deletions of various adenoviral gene sequences have been designed as suitable vehicles for delivery of nucleic acids to cells. In some embodiments an adenoviral vector of the invention is a helper dependent or a gutless adenoviral vector. Adenoviral vectors can be used that are deleted in one or more of the following genes E1a E1b E2a E2b and E3. Methods for conducting adenovirus based nucleic acid delivery are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 824 544 5 868 040 5 871 722 5 880 102 5 882 877 5 885 808 5 932 210 5 981 225 5 994 106 5 994 132 5 994 134 and 6 001 557.

AAV vectors are derived from single stranded ss DNA parvoviruses. A single AAV particle can accommodate up to 5 kb of ssDNA leaving about 4.5 kb for a transgene and regulatory elements. Trans splicing systems as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 544 785 may nearly double this limit and these types of vectors may also be used with the invention. With regard to the invention essentially AAV of any serotype can be used. In some embodiments of the invention an AAV1 AAV2 AAV3 AAV4 AAV5 AAV6 AAV7 AAV8 or AAV9 serotype may be used e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 173 414 5 252 479 5 552 311 5 658 776 5 658 785 5 763 416 5 773 289 5 843 742 5 869 040 5 942 496 5 948 675 6 001 650 and 7 790 449 PCT Publication No. WO2009134681 Kassim et al. PLoS ONE 2010 5 10 e13424 1 10 Kotin Hum Mol Genet 2011 20 R1 R2 6 although the invention is not limited to these serotypes see e.g. Gao et al. 2002 PNAS 99 11854 11859 and Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy Methods and Protocols ed. Machida Humana Press 2003 .

An AAV vector of the invention may also be pseudotyped. Pseudotyped AAV vectors contain the genome of one AAV serotype in the capsid of a second AAV serotype e.g. see Auricchio et al. 2001 Hum. Mol. Genet. 10 26 3075 81 . An AAV vector of the invention may contain a mutated capsid and or be retargeted. For example see Grieger et al. Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol. 2005 99 119 45 Gon alves et al. Mol Ther. 2006 13 5 976 86 and Warrington et al. J Virol. 2004 78 12 6595 609 .

In some embodiments of the invention an AAV vector is coated with polymers e.g. reactive polymers to reduce natural tropism or natural binding of the AAV vector to retarget the AAV vector and or to provide resistance to neutralizing antisera. For example see Carlisle et al. J Gene Med. 2008 10 4 400 11 .

Retroviruses are RNA viruses wherein the viral genome is RNA. When a host cell is infected with a retrovirus the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into a DNA intermediate which is integrated efficiently into the chromosomal DNA of infected cells. Lentiviruses contain other genes with regulatory or structural function. The use of retroviral vectors for gene delivery is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 013 516 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 994 136. Examples of BIV systems are described for example in Matukonis et al. 2002 13 1293 1303 Molina et al. 2002 304 10 23 Molina et al. 2004 Hum. Gene Ther. 15 65 877 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 864 085 7 125 712 7 153 512 PCT Publication No. WO08 106 644 and U.S. Patent Publication No. US20100120665.

A DNA viral vector is a viral vector based on or derived from a virus that has a DNA based genome. A non enveloped virus viral vector is a viral vector based on or derived from a virus that lacks a lipid bilayer membrane.

In some embodiments a viral vector of the invention is an AAV vector. In some embodiments a viral vector of the invention is not a bovine immunodeficiency viral vector or it is not a lentiviral vector. In some embodiments a viral vector is selected from the group consisting of a DNA viral vector a non enveloped viral vector and an adenoviral vector.

Another approach to gene therapy or protein delivery involves transferring a gene to cells in vitro or ex vivo and then administering the cells to a mammal or patient. Transferring a nucleic acid to cells can be by any method such as transfection microinjection electroporation cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion lipofection microparticle bombardment calcium phosphate mediated transfection viral vector or bacteriophage transduction and so on. Optionally a selectable marker also can be introduced into the cells. If a selectable marker is utilized the cells can be then placed under selection e.g. to enhance expression and or to isolate select those cells that express the transferred coding region see e.g. Loeffler Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 1993 and Cline Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92 1985 . Those cells can then be delivered to a patient directly or after encapsulation.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to in vivo administration of the resulting recombinant cell.

In some embodiments an anti inflammatory is administered in the same solution and or same syringe as an RdCVF protein nucleic acid or vector of the invention. In some embodiments an RdCVF protein nucleic acid or vector of the invention and an anti inflammatory are co administered to the eye.

Many anti inflammatory drugs are known in the art and include but are not limited to dexamethasone dexamethasone sodium metasulfobenzoate dexamethasone sodium phosphate fluorometholone bromfenac pranoprofen cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion e.g. RESTASIS naproxen glucocorticoids ketorolac ibuprofen tolmetin non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs steroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac flurbiprofen indomethacin and suprofen.

Some embodiments of the invention include administration of both an RdCVF protein and a vector encoding it. An RdCVF protein may be delivered prior to concurrently with and or after administration of a vector of the invention. In some embodiments an RdCVF protein is administered in the same solution and or same syringe as a vector of the invention. In some embodiments a vector of the invention and an RdCVF protein are co administered to the eye.

In some embodiments of the invention a gene delivery system can result in transduction and or stable integration of a gene or coding region for an RdCVF protein into a target cell. In some embodiments target cells are mammalian cells such as primate cells or human cells. In some embodiments target cells are cells of the eye such as retinal pigment epithelial cells rod photoreceptor cells cone photoreceptor cells bipolar cells horizontal cells amacrine cells ganglion cells retinal cells or pluripotential cells. Target cells can be in vitro ex vivo or in vivo. In some embodiments a target cell is a stem cell. Stem cells include but are not limited to pluripotent stem cells totipotent stem cells hematopoietic stem cells cancer stem cells and embryonic stem cells. In some embodiments pluripotential cells contemplated herein are not those for propagating a living entity from a zygote or blastomere. The instant invention also contemplates the use of a partially undifferentiated cell for implantation into the eye of a patient in need of treatment e.g. to regenerate cells of the eye.

The invention also provides methods of treatment. In some embodiments the invention provides methods of preserving ocular rod cells comprising administering to the eye of a mammal a nucleic acid of the invention a viral vector of the invention an RdCVF protein of the invention a pharmaceutical composition of the invention or a combination thereof. In some embodiments a viral vector and or nucleic acid of the invention is administered by subretinal injection intravitreal injection injection to the intraanterior chamber of the eye subconjunctival injection subtenon injection or any combination thereof. In some embodiments a human is treated. In some embodiments the mammal to be treated suffers from an ocular disease selected from the group consisting of a retinal dystrophy Stargardt s disease retinitis pigmentosa dry age related macular degeneration dry AMD geographic atrophy advanced stage of dry AMD wet age related macular degeneration wet AMD glaucoma ocular hypertension diabetic retinopathy Bardet Biedel syndrome Bassen Kornzweig syndrome Best disease choroidema gyrate atrophy congenital amaurosis refsun syndrome Usher syndrome thyroid related eye disease Grave s disease a disease associated with retinal pigmented epithelial cells anterior segment disease lens disease cataracts an eye cup disorder or uveitis. In some embodiments the preserved ocular rod cell does not contain a nucleic acid and or viral vector of the invention. For example the preserved ocular cell is not preserved through transduction of the preserved ocular cell itself.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a method of preserving ocular rod cells comprising administering to the eye of a mammal a nucleic acid and or viral vector of the invention wherein the nucleic acid and or the viral vector is administered by subretinal injection and the rod cells and or cones cells are preserved at a site at least 1 mm at least 2 mm at least 3 mm at least 5 mm at least 7 mm at least 10 mm at least 15 mm at least 20 mm or at least 25 mm from the site of the subretinal injection. For example and not wishing to be bound by theory the cells transduced with the nucleic acid or viral vector at the subretinal injection site expresses and or secrete an RdCVF long and or an RdCVF short protein which can provide an ocular rod and or cone preserving effect at a site distant to the transduced cell or injection site.

In addition to its expression in the eye RdCVF protein is also naturally expressed in other tissues. Using a proteomics approach 90 proteins were found to interact with RdCVFL including the microtubule binding protein tau Fridlich et al. Mol Cell Proteomics 2009 8 6 1206 1218 . Fridlich et al. demonstrated that the level of phosphorylation of TAU is increased in the retina of the Nxnl1 RdCVF1 mice as it is hyperphosphorylated in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease presumably in some cases through oxidative stress. Fridlich et al. also showed that RdCVFL inhibits TAU phosphorylation. Cronin et al. Cell Death and Differentiation 2010 17 1199 1210 found that Nxnl1 RdCVF1 retinas contained aggregated TAU protein as found in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease.

Mice lacking RdCVF2 have impaired vision and olfaction. Normal mice express RdCVF2 in the olfactory epithelium. Jaillard et al. ARVO meeting 2009 program poster 491 D636 reported that olfactory neurons were found to survive to a higher rate when cultured in the presence of RdCVF2. Jaillard et al. also compared RdCVF2 to control mice by performing olfactory discrimination learning tests. By 12 months of age the RdCVF2 mice failed to respond correctly to the stimulus.

RdCVF proteins have neuroprotective activity and are not only a factor for cone and or rod survival but are general neuron survival factors.

Therefore based on the above an RdCVF encoding nucleic acid viral vector or RdCVF protein of the invention can be used to treat or ameliorate Alzheimer s disease Huntington s disease Parkinson s disease and olfactory diseases.

The invention includes methods of treating a disease comprising administering to a mammal a nucleic acid of the invention a viral vector of the invention an RdCVF protein of the invention a pharmaceutical composition of the invention or a combination thereof wherein the disease is selected from the group consisting of Alzheimer s disease Huntington s disease Parkinson s disease and an olfactory disease. In some embodiments the viral vector of this invention is an AAV vector.

The invention is now described with reference to the following examples.

Whereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of description it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims.

All publications patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety into the specification to the same extent as if each individual publication patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated herein by reference.

Recoded human RdCVF1S and RdCVF1L nucleotide coding regions were designed e.g. nucleotides 106 741 of SEQ ID NO 1 nucleotides 106 744 of SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 12 or 14 . GENEART Regensburg Germany synthesized nucleic acid sequences that among other things contained codon optimized nucleotide coding sequences for RdCVF1S and RdCVF1L. These coding sequences were also recoded to minimize motifs such as procarya inhibitory motifs consensus splice donor sites and cryptic splice donor sites.

The recoding of a human RdCVF1L coding sequence also provided a recoded RdCVF1S coding region nucleotides 1 327 of SEQ ID NO 12 with a stop codon at the 3 end.

Recoding of a native RdCVF1L coding sequence to SEQ ID NO 12 removed 2 procarya inhibitory motifs 1 consensus splice donor site and 3 cryptic splice donor sites leaving none of these elements in the recoded sequence SEQ ID NO 12 . Recoding also changed the average GC content from 65 to 63 .

Nucleotides 1 327 of SEQ ID NO 12 also provide a recoded coding sequence for RdCVF1S but without a stop codon such as TGA.

Recoding of a native RdCVF1S coding sequence to SEQ ID NO 14 removed 1 procarya inhibitory motif 1 consensus splice donor site and 2 cryptic splice donor sites leaving none of these elements in the recoded sequence SEQ ID NO 14 . Recoding also changed the average GC content from 58 to 61 .

The cDNA of the short form of the RdCVF protein was amplified by PCR from the nucleic acid synthesized by GENEART and cloned into pSecTag2A plasmid Invitrogen Catalog No. V900 20 that incorporated a mouse Igk signal peptide sequence such that the Igk signal peptide DNA sequence is oriented five prime to an RdCVFS coding sequence. The resulting plasmid was designated pAVTrRd034. The size and orientation of pAVTrRd034 was confirmed using restriction enzyme digests. The Igk RdCVFS sequence was amplified by PCR from pAVTrRd034 and inserted into the adeno associated virus vector plasmid pAAV MCS Cell Biolabs San Diego Calif. creating the plasmid pAAV SRd269 SEQ ID NO 8 . The codon optimized long form of RdCVF was amplified by PCR and inserted into the in house cloning plasmid pAVT001 creating the plasmid pAVTLrRd055 SEQ ID NO 9 . Plasmids pAVTLrRd055 and pAAV SRd269 were double digested with Bgl II and Stu I. The 4.8 kb band from pAAV SRd269 and the 540 bp band from pAVTLrRd055 were ligated creating pAAV LRd268 SEQ ID NO 10 that contained a recoded coding sequence for long RdCVF. The size and orientation of pAAV LRd268 was confirmed using restriction enzyme digests.

Because the N terminal sequences of the short and the long form of the RdCVF protein is identical the end of the short RdCVF DNA sequence of pAVTrRd034 was exchanged for the end of the codon optimized long RdCVF DNA sequence from the plasmid pAVTLrRdCVF055 thereby generating the rAAV plasmid pAAV LRd268 containing the following features in between the AAV ITRs 

Plasmids pAAV LRd268 pHELPER Cell BioLabs Catalog No. 340202 and pRC2 Cell BioLabs Catalog No. 340201 were transformed into DH10B competent bacteria cells Invitrogen Catalog No. 18297 010 and scaled up using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit or EndoFree Plasmid Mega Kit according to the manufacturer s instructions. The plasmid concentrations were determined using a Beckman DU 600 spectrophotometer. Each plasmids identity was confirmed by restriction digests and analysis.

To produce rAAV RdCVF1L vector 293AAV cells Cell BioLabs Catalog No. AAV 100 were seeded at 4 million cells per 15 cm dish in cDMEM DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS 1 Glutamine 1 non essential amino acids and 1 Penicillin Streptomycin . The following day the medium was replaced with 25 mL fresh cDMEM. Two hours later the transfection was performed. Water 57.4 mL was mixed with 1.3 mg pHELPER 650 g pRC2 650 g pAAV LRd268 and 8.1 mL 2 M CaCl water plasmid CaClmix . A 12.5 mL volume of 2 HBS Lonza Sku RR07005 was transferred into each of five 50 mL conical tubes. While vortexing 12.5 mL of the water plasmid CaClmix was slowly added to each of the conical tubes containing 2 HBS. After a 5 minute incubation 2.5 mL of the suspension was added to each cell culture dish containing the 293AAV cells.

The following day the medium was replaced with 25 mL new cDMEM medium per dish. Two days later the cells were harvested using a cell lifter and the cell medium mix was transferred into 250 mL conical tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets resuspended in 110 mL DMEM. The resuspended cell samples were aliquoted 30 mL into 50 mL conical tubes and a freeze thaw freeze step was performed using ethanol dry ice bath and 37 C. water bath. The tubes were stored at 80 C. until further process of the material. The same process was employed to produce rAAV GFP substituting the plasmid pAAV LRd268 with the plasmid pAAV GFP Cell BioLabs Catalog No. AAV 400 .

To purify the rAAV RdCVF1L vector four 50 mL conical tubes containing the vector from the freeze thaw freeze step was thawed at 37 C. in a water bath. Forty microliters of BENZONASE Sigma Catalog No. E8263 25kU was added to each tube which was then incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3 000 rpm and the supernatants were transferred into a 500 mL bottle. Six milliliters of a 10 sodium deoxycholate solution 8.2 g in 82 mL water was added. The sample was briefly mixed and incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes. The suspension was filtered using 5 m filters. Subsequently another filtration step using 0.8 m filters was performed. A heparin agarose column 8 mL Sigma Catalog No. H6508 25 mL was prepared and the column was equilibrated with 48 mL phosphate buffered saline PBS Invitrogen Catalog No. 10010 049 . The filtered cell lysate was loaded onto the column and the column was washed with 40 mL washing buffer 20 mL 5 M NaCl 980 mL PBS . The vector was eluted using 15 mL elution buffer 80 mL 5 M NaCl 920 mL PBS and collected in a new 50 mL conical tube.

The vector was concentrated by centrifugal filtration. An Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugational filter unit Millipore Catalog No. UFC910024 was rinsed once with PBS and the eluted sample was added to the device. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman Allegro 6KR centrifuge at 2 200 rpm 22 C. until the sample was concentrated to a 1 2 mL volume. A 15 mL volume of PBS was added and the centrifugation was repeated until the sample volume was 1 mL. The purified vector was collected and the filter walls rinsed with 100 L of PBS. The sample was mixed and 30 L aliquots of the vector were stored at 80 C. in 600 L conical tubes until use.

To measure the genomic titer of the purified rAAV RdCVF1L and rAAV GFP vectors 5 L of the appropriate vector was mixed with 5 L 10 DNase buffer 1 L DNase I enzyme Roche Catalog No. 04716728001 and water for a total volume of 50 L. After incubation for 30 minutes at 37 C. the enzyme was inactivated by incubation at 65 C. for 10 minutes. Proteinase K 0.5 L Roche Catalog No 03115887001 was added. The sample was briefly mixed and incubated for 60 minutes at 50 C. The proteinase K was inactivated by 95 C. for 20 minutes. In parallel a spike control was used where 5 L of the spike standard 2 10single stranded DNA from pAAV GFP was added to the reaction. These reactions were performed in 0.2 mL 8 tube strips without caps Biorad Catalog No. TBS 0201 using 8 flat cap strips BioRad Catalog No. TCS 0803 in a BioRad PCR thermo cycler.

A master mix for the qPCR was setup containing 825 L water 1.875 L iQ SYBR Green Supermix BioRad Catalog No. 170 8882 and 337.5 L of each of the primers QPCR CMV 1 SEQ ID NO 5 and QPCR CMV 2 SEQ ID NO 6 . A 45 L volume of the mix was added per well into a 96 well PCR plate and either 5 L of the digested vector spike digested vector undigested vector 5 L purified vector with 40 L water and 5 L DNase buffer undigested spiked vector 5 L purified vector with 35 L water 5 L DNase buffer and 5 L spike standard were added and mixed. A PCR process was performed and samples from Cycle 3 used for melting curve analysis.

The concentration of these single stranded DNA genomes was analyzed by quantitative PCR as described above. The concentration of the rAAV RdCVF1L vector particles was determined to be 2 10vector genome copies per milliliter GC mL and the concentration of rAAV GFP vector particles was determined to be 2 10GC mL.

To examine the purity of the purified rAAV RdCVF1L and rAAV GFP vectors the vector lysates were subjected to SDS PAGE with silver staining analysis. Specifically 20 L of lysis buffer 8.4 mL water 500 L 1 M Tris pH 8.0 1 mL Glycerol 300 L 5 M NaCl 50 L NP 40 40 L EDTA 100 L PMSF 1 tablet protease inhibitor Roche Catalog No. 11836170001 was added to 20 L of the respective purified recombinant AAV vector and kept on ice for 20 minutes. The reaction was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13 000 rpm and 4 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube 10 L of 5 reducing sample buffer Pierce Catalog No. 39000 was added and the samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 95 C.

Electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions. A 4 15 SDS PAGE gel was rinsed with water and placed into the gel chamber. Running buffer 1 Tris Glycine SDS made by diluting 10 Tris Glycine SDS running buffer BioRad Catalog No. 161 0732 with water was added to upper and lower buffer chambers. The wells were rinsed twice with 200 L running buffer and the samples were loaded. As a control a 1 L volume of BENCHMARK protein ladder Invitrogen Catalog No. 10747 012 was added to the outer wells. Equal concentrations of the vectors as determined by genomic titer analysis were loaded. The gel was run at 200 V until the dye reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was fixed and silver stained according to the manufacturer s directions Biorad Silver Stain Plus Catalog No. 161 0449 .

Only the three AAV virus proteins VP1 90 kDa VP2 72 kDa and VP3 60 kDa were visible . Because no other protein bands are visible in the silver stain analysis this would confirm that the vector preparations resulted in production of highly pure vector particles.

To examine RdCVF1L expression and secretion mediated by the rAAV RdCVF1L vector ARPE 19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells ATCC Manassas Va. were seeded at 200 000 cells in 3 mL of cDMEM per well in a 6 well plate. For the transgene expression after AAV infection the time limiting step is the second strand synthesis of the single stranded DNA genome which can take several weeks e.g. see Ferrari et al. 1996 . J. Virol. 70 3227 3234. However radiation can be used prior to transduction to expedite the expression of proteins after rAAV vector transduction in cell culture e.g. see Alexander et al. 1994 J Virol. 68 8282 8287.

Twenty four hours later the cells were irradiated with 175 Gy of Cs with a Shepherd Associates Model Mark 1 68 Self shielded irradiator. Two hours later the medium was replaced with 1.5 mL of fresh cDMEM and 3 L of purified recombinant AAV vector was added. One plate was untransduced no AAV as a control one plate transduced with rAAV GFP vector and one plate was transduced with rAAV RdCVF1L vector.

Two days after transduction the supernatants from the transduced and untransduced cells were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 m filter. An equal volume of lysate buffer 9.4 mL water 200 L 1 M Tris pH 8.0 40 L 0.5 M EDTA 300 L 5 M NaCl 100 L NP 40 100 L PMSF 1 tablet protease inhibitor was added and stored at 80 C. until use. The cells from each plate were washed with PBS scraped off using a cell lifter pooled and transferred into 15 mL conical tubes. The cells were centrifuged for 4 minutes at 1 200 rpm and 4 C. in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR centrifuge and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer see above transferred into 1.5 mL tubes and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13 000 rpm and 4 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. The cleared cell lysates were aliquoted into 200 L volumes in 1.5 mL tubes and stored at 80 C. until use.

Western blot analysis using a 4 20 SDS PAGE gel was used to detect RdCVF1L expression using standard techniques. As a control a 5 L volume of MAGICMARK XP Standard Invitrogen Catalog No. LC5602 was added to the outer wells. The gel was run at 200 V until the dye reached the bottom of the gel. Western blot analysis was performed with a Vectastain ABC Amp Western blot analysis kit by Vector Laboratories according to a modified version of the manufacturer s instructions. The SDS PAGE was equilibrated in transfer buffer for 20 min and proteins separated by SDS PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans Blot Semi Dry Transfer Cell at 20 V for 40 minutes. Once the transfer was completed the membrane was blocked in 200 mL of 1 casein solution with gentle agitation on a rocker platform for at least two hours at room temperature RT for supernatant and 4 C. over night plus 1 hour at RT for cell lysate. The membrane was incubated with 50 mL with rabbit anti RdCVF protein specific monoclonal antibody primary antibody generated by Covance Denver Pa. using purified His Tag RdCVF1L protein produced in Protein One Rockville Md. diluted 1 2 000 supernatant or 1 10 000 cell lysate in 1 casein solution with gentle agitation at 4 C. overnight or 2 hours at room temperature respectively. The membrane was washed with 30 mL of a 1 casein solution 4 times for 5 minutes each at RT with gentle agitation. The membrane was incubated with 30 mL of biotinylated goat anti rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted 1 24 000 in 1 casein solution for 1 hour at RT with gentle agitation. The membrane was washed in 30 mL of 1 casein solution 3 times for 5 minutes each at RT with gentle agitation. The membrane was incubated for 45 minutes in Vectastain ABC AmP in 50 mL of 1 casein containing 100 L of Reagent A and 100 L of Reagent B. The membrane was washed in 30 mL of 1 casein solution 3 times for 5 minutes each at RT with gentle agitation.

The membrane was incubated in Tris pH 9.5. The chemiluminescent signal was acquired using 6 mL of Duolox Substrate Vector Laboratories Catalog No. SK 6605 and exposing the membrane to Kodak BioMax MS X ray film Kodak Carestream Health Catalog No. 8572786 in a film cassette for 10 seconds to 5 minutes followed by development of the film using Kodak Developer solution Kodak GBX Catalog No. 1900984 and Kodak Fixer solution.

The level of expressed RdCVF1L protein in the cell lysate indicated that the rAAV RdCVF1L vector transduced ARPE cells efficiently. More importantly the RdCVF1L protein was efficiently secreted into the cell culture medium of the vector transduced cells . However two RdCVF1L protein positive bands with the expected molecular weight were observed in the rAAV RdCVF1L vector transduced cell lysate samples lane 3 and three such bands were detected in the cell supernatant samples lane 3 . Without wishing to be bound by theory the two lower molecular weight bands in the cell supernatant lane 3 that have the same molecular weights as those in the cell lysate may have been released from some dead cells in the culture. The third band with slightly higher molecular weight in the supernatant likely represented a secreted form of RdCVF1L which was absent from the cell lysate. The data also suggested that the three forms of RdCVF1L including the secreted form of RdCVF1L was likely post translationally modified.

The RdCVF1L AAV vector was able to efficiently transduce human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE 19 cells leading to expression and secretion of the long RdCVF protein as detected by Western Blot. Two distinct RdCVFL proteins bands were observed in the rAAV RdCVF1L vector transduced cell lysate samples in addition to a higher band. Three RdCVFL protein bands were detected in the vector transduced cell supernatant. The two of them that having the same molecular weights as those seen in the cell lysate were possibly from dead cells in the cell culture. The third band with slightly higher molecular weight likely represented the secreted form of RdCVF1L. These data also suggested that RdCVF1L including the secreted form of RdCVF1L was likely post translationally modified.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether subretinal administration of rAAV RdCVF1L can increase RdCVF levels in the retina of the mouse eye. Recombinant AAV serotype 2 vector rAAV RdCVF1L and control vector rAAV GFP were prepared as described in Example 2.

Female BALB C mice 5 6 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. and used in this study. The animals were allowed a minimum 1 week acclimation period prior to use for study. They were housed under a 12 hr light dark cycle with a light intensity of 

Subretinal injections were performed under anesthesia. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 25 30 g gram of ketamine combined with 5 6 g gram xylazine. Anesthetic doses were adjusted to achieve a deep plane of anesthesia. Eyes were treated with a topical application of 0.5 proparacaine hydrochloride Bausch Lomb Inc. Rochester N.Y. for local anesthesia and 0.3 AK Tob Bausch Lomb Inc. for disinfection immediately before procedures. Pupils were dilated with 1 tropicamide Akorn Inc. Buffalo Grove Ill. .

Briefly the anesthetized mouse was positioned under a Zeiss operating microscope with the eye to be injected under view approx 10 magnification . Gentle pressure was applied on the eyelids with a jeweler s forceps to make the entire globe prolapse forward. The superior temporal conjunctiva was carefully dissected to expose the sclera. A 30 gauge needle was used to perform a shelving puncture of the sclera choroid and retina at approximately 11 o clock right eye and 1 o clock left eye 0.5 mm posterior to the limbus. A drop of Gonak 2.5 Akorn Inc was instilled on the cornea and a coverslip gently placed on the corneal surface to aid in viewing the fundus. A 33 gauge blunt needle attached to a 5 L Hamilton syringe was inserted through the sclerotomy in a tangential direction toward the posterior pole without touching the lens and the tip of the needle placed on the inner surface of the retina. The retina was perforated and 1 L of vector was injected into the subretinal space. After injection the needle was carefully withdrawn and the conjunctiva repositioned. The success of each injection was confirmed by evaluating the fundus for signs of retinal detachment. Any eyes that displayed subretinal or intravitreal hemorrhages were excluded as well as eyes that did not display a retinal detachment or bleb . Neomycin and polymycin B sulfate and Bacitracin Zinc ophthalmic ointment Bausch Lomb Inc. was applied to the cornea to minimize drying of this tissue while the animals were recovering from anesthesia on a warm blanket.

Western blots were generated with protein extracts from rAAV RdCVF1L vector injected eyes and contra lateral uninjected control eyes obtained six weeks after administration of rAAV RdCVF1L vector. Briefly eyeballs were enucleated and extra ocular tissues and anterior segment were removed. The remaining posterior segments were quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen. These samples were stored at 80 C. until used for protein extraction. For each eyecup 200 L of ice cold T PER tissue protein extraction reagent Pierce Cat. No. 78510 with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Roche Diagnostics Cat. No. 11836170001 was added. The samples were sonicated 5 seconds on ice with a Sonic dismembrator Fisher Scientific Model 100 Pittsburgh Pa. . The sonicated samples were kept on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 minutes at 4 C. to remove cell debris. The supernatants were collected and protein concentrations determined using a Bradford protein assay. For RdCVFL controls rAAV RdCVF1L transduced ARPE 19 cell lysate served as the positive control and untransduced cell lysate as the negative control. Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis. For each lane 36 g of total protein was loaded on a 4 20 Criterion TGX Precast Gel Bio Rad Cat. No. 567 1094 and subjected to electrophoreses at 200 volts for 70 minutes. The proteins were electroblotted onto 0.2 m nitrocellulose blotting membranes using a Trans Blot Semi Dry Transfer Cell. The blots were blocked using a 1 casein solution Vector Laboratories Cat. No. SP 5020 for 2 hrs at RT and incubated with the rabbit anti RdCVFL primary antibody Covance Research Products Denver Pa. diluted 1 2 000 or rabbit anti opsin red green polyclonal antibody Millipore Temecura Calif. diluted 1 500. After three washes with 1 casein solution each blot was incubated with alkaline phosphatase goat anti rabbit IgG antibody Vector Laboratories Cat. No. AP 1000 diluted 1 3 000. The protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate detection kit. Beta tubulin 50 kD was used for equal protein loading control. The blot was stripped with Restore Plus Western Blot Stripping Buffer Thermo Scientific Cat. No. 46430 and re probed with an anti tubulin monoclonal antibody Sigma Aldrich Cat. No. T4026 diluted 1 500 followed by an alkaline phosphatase conjugated horse anti mouse IgG antibody Vector Laboratories Cat. No. AP 2000 diluted 1 3 000 in 1 casein solution.

Protein densitometry of the autoradiographs performed with a Kodak Imaging Station was used to quantify the scanned protein bands which were normalized with respect to the beta tubulin level in the same blot.

The presence of RdCVF1L protein was clearly detected in eyes received rAAV RdCVF1L injection as prominent double immunoreactive bands with a molecular size of approximately 30 kDa . Western blot of cell lysates from ARPE 19 cells transduced by rAAV RdCVF1L which served as a positive control also yielded 2 individual protein bands with identical sizes. Neither protein extracts from contra lateral eyes which received no subretinal injection nor eyes injected with rAAV GFP produced similar protein bands detected by anti RdCVFL antibody . The double immunoreactive bands were similar to the double bands observed in vitro in ARPE 19 cells transduced by rAAV RdCVF1L. The reason for the absence of the third band likely the secreted form of RdCVF1L was that these in vivo samples were protein extracts from retinal cells.

RdCVF1L immunostaining was performed in the wholemount preparation of the neuroretina and RPE choroida sclera. Animals were terminally anesthetized and eyes were enucleated and immediately fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline PBS 7.4 1 liquid Gibco Cat. No. 10010 031 overnight at 4 C. Each mouse eye was marked at the inferior quadrant of cornea with India ink prior to enucleation. Eyecups were prepared by removing anterior segment under a Leica dissecting microscope. A small nick was made at the inferior quadrant for orientation. The neuroretina was carefully dissected away from the RPE severed at the optic nerve. The wholemounts were rinsed three times with 1 PBS and blocked with 5 donkey serum in 2 Triton X 100 in PBS for 2 hrs at RT. After removing blocking solution the wholemounts were sequentially incubated with the primary antibody rabbit anti RdCVF 1 1 000 in blocking solution at 4 C. overnight and secondary antibody ALEXA FLUOR 488 donkey anti rabbit 1 1 000 in 2 Triton X 100 in PBS 2 hrs at RT. After final rinses with PBS each wholemount was flat mounted on a glass slide with photoreceptors facing upward for the neuroretina and RPE facing upward for the RPE choroid sclera. The flatmounts were then examined with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with digital camera Spot RT Color 2.2.1 Diagnostic Instruments Inc and epifluorescence.

Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased expression of RdCVF1L protein in the rAAV RdCVF1L vector injected eyes. Robust RdCVF1L immunostaining was observed in the RPE cells in the rAAV RdCVF injected eyes but not from the uninjected contralateral eyes . Increased expression of RdCVF1L was seen only in the focal area covering approximately one quadrant of each eye indicating the expression was only confined to the bleb area from subretinal injection. Samples stained without primary antibody did not show any immunoreactivity . A marked increase in the expression of this protein was also observed in photoreceptor cells in the rAAV RdCVF1L injected eyes. Strong RdCVF1L staining was seen in the photoreceptor outer segments in the flatmounted neuroretina. Again the positive staining was localized only in a focal area of the retina covering from 10 30 of retina. There was only background staining in the uninjected contra lateral eyes . No immunoreactivity was found in the samples processed without primary antibody .

To determine whether the tested AAV vectors could efficiently transduce RPE and photoreceptor cells in mouse eyes a group of mice n 7 were injected subretinally with rAAV GFP and sacrificed 6 wks later. RPE choroid sclera and neuroretina were separated and flat mounted on glass slides. Fluorescent microscopy revealed robust GFP expression in RPE and photoreceptor layer data not shown . The RPE cells expressing GFP spread 1 2 quadrants of the flatmount with the maximal number and most robust GFP expressing cells present at the injection site. Transduced RPE cells appeared healthy as they maintained their hexagonal morphology. In the flatmounted neuroretinas GFP expression was identified in the photoreceptor outer segments. Occasionally inner retinal cells such as ganglion cells were GFP positive possibly due to vector leakage into the vitreous after subretinal injection.

This study demonstrated efficient transduction of RPE and photoreceptor cells by the rAAV RdCVF1L vector following successful subretinal injection. The RdCVF1L expression construct delivered by this vector led to significant increases in the levels of RdCVF1L protein in the mouse eyes.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether subretinal administration of an AAV based gene therapy vector encoding RdCVF1L could promote photoreceptor survival in rd10 mice a naturally occurring animal model for human inherited retinal degeneration. Rd10 mice are a naturally occurring animal model for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa RP . Rd10 mice have a missense point mutation in rod cGMP phosphodiesterase gene resulting in apoptosis of photoreceptor cells Chang et al. 2007 47 624 633 . Rod photoreceptor cells start degenerating at 18 days of age with peak photoreceptor death occurring at P25 Gargini et al. 2007 500 222 238 . By five weeks most photoreceptor cells have been degenerated Chang et al. 2002 42 517 525 Chang et al. 2007 47 624 633 Gargini et al. 2007 500 222 238 . Interestingly it has been found that rearing rd10 mice in darkness slows photoreceptor degeneration by as much as four weeks Chang et al. 2007 47 624 633 suggesting light exposure can accelerate photoreceptor death. On the other hand delayed photoreceptor degeneration by keeping these mice in darkness can extend the therapeutic time window for vectors that need to time for therapeutic transgene expression e.g. adequate transgene expression from an AAV will usually take about 3 weeks.

Breeding pairs of congenic inbred strain of rd10 mice 4 5 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. and bred in an animal facility. They were housed under a 12 hr light dark cycle with a light intensity of 

Animals at the age of postnatal day 3 were anesthetized by hypothermia. This anesthetic method has been well established for neonatal mice and rats for up to 5 days of age and is appropriate for short minor surgical procedures 5 15 minutes in these animals Gaertner et al. Anesthesia and Analgesia 2nd ed. pages 277 278 . The pup was placed on crushed ice for 3 4 minutes. During this time the color of pup was changed from pink to pale. Subretinal injections were performed under this type of anesthesia.

The anesthetized mouse was positioned under a Zeiss operating microscope with the eye to be injected under view approx. 10 magnification . Eyelids and adjacent area were disinfected with 5 povidone iodine. The eye was exposed by separation of the palpebral fissure using an Iris scissor. Gentle pressure was applied on the eyelids with a jeweler s forceps to make the entire globe prolapse forward. A drop of 0.3 Tobromycin Bausch Lomb Inc. was given for disinfection. A 30 gauge sharp needle was used to perform a shelving puncture of the sclera choroid and retina at approximately the 11 O clock right eye position about 0.5 mm posterior to the limbus. A 33 gauge blunt needle attached to a 5 L Hamilton syringe was inserted through the sclerotomy in a tangential direction toward the posterior pole. The tip of the needle was placed in the subretinal space and 1 L of AAV vector was injected into the subretinal space. After injection the needle was slowly withdrawn. Any eyes that displayed subretinal or intravitreal hemorrhages were excluded from study. Neomycin and polymycin B sulfate and bacitracin zinc ophthalmic ointment Bausch Lomb Inc. was applied to the cornea to prevent infection and minimize drying of this tissue. Animals were allowed to recover on a warm heating pad.

Mice were deeply anesthetized and their eyes were marked at the superior quadrant with red tissue dye for orientation. They were then sacrificed and immediately enucleated and fixed in Davidson s fixative for about 24 hrs at RT. After sequential dehydration in ethanol and Clear rite eyes were embedded in paraffin Fisher Sci. Houston Tex. . Retinal sections of 5 m thickness were cut along the vertical meridian to allow examination of the superior and inferior retina. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope Olympus BX51 . The outer nuclear layer ONL thickness was evaluated by counting the number of rows of nuclei in the central and peripheral retina. Photoreceptor morphology was also examined.

The treated rd10 mouse eyes were assessed for the degree of structural rescue at the age of 5 weeks. Light microscopy showed obvious preservation of outer nuclear layer ONL in the AAV RdCVF1L treated eyes in comparison with untreated contralateral eyes. Typically the RdCVF1L vector treated retina possessed 2 5 rows of photoreceptor nuclei in the superior and or inferior regions as opposed to 1 2 rows in the untreated contralateral eyes in the same locations . The rescue was not limited to the injected area the superior quadrant as the protection was also observed in the inferior quadrant. Morphometric analysis showed approximately 75 of retina was protected in vector treated eyes in comparison with 34 in untreated eyes. Some preserved photoreceptors even possessed inner and outer segments . It is noteworthy that the rescued photoreceptors contained both rod and cone cells.

Peanut agglutinin PNA a cone cell specific marker was used to stain the wholemount preparation of the retina. Mouse eyes were marked at the superior quadrant of cornea with Indian ink and red dye at temporal quadrant prior to enucleation. They were immediately fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde at least overnight at 4 C. Eyecups were prepared by removing anterior segment under a Leica dissecting microscope. A small nick was made at the superior quadrant for orientation. After 4 radial cuts around the circumference the entire neuroretina was carefully dissected away from the eye cup. The retinas were rinsed three times with 1 PBS and blocked with 6 of bovine serum albumin BSA in PBS Gibco Cat. No. 10010 031 with 0.2 Triton X 100 for 30 minutes at RT. After removing blocking solution retinas were incubated with Lectin PNA Conjugates Alexa Fluor 594 1 250 in PBS Invitrogen Corp Chicago Ill. overnight at 4 C. After final rinses with PBS each retina was flat mounted on a glass slide with photoreceptors facing upward. The retinal wholemounts were then examined with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with digital camera Spot RT Color 2.2.1 Diagnostic Instruments Inc and epifluorescence.

To assess cone cell density in the retinal wholemounts two images were taken with 60 objective from each retinal quadrant at 1 and 2 mm location from the edge of optic nerve head respectively. The number of cones presented each image 390 293 m were counted with the Image Pro Plus software Media Cybernetics Inc. Bethesda Md. .

For some eyes retinal cryostat sections 12 m in thickness were cut with a Leica cryostat microtome Leica Microsystems Model CM 1850 Leica Bannockburn Ill. and stained with PNA examined with the fluorescent microscope aforementioned.

Cone photoreceptor cells were identified by PNA labeling which selectively stains cone inner and outer segments in flat mounted neuroretina. Fluorescent microscopy showed severe degeneration of cone cells in the untreated eyes particularly at the posterior central retina e.g. around the optic nerve head. Cone cells lost outer segments and their inner segments are short blunted and irregular. In contrast vector treated eyes had greater cone density much less disorganized cone segments and more uniformed cone staining data not shown . Under higher magnification PNA positive cone cells were counted in all 4 quadrants at 1 and 2 mm locations from optic nerve head. Quantification of cone density showed significantly high numbers of cone photoreceptors in the vector treated eyes relative to untreated contralateral ones 181 46.4 versus 50 25.2 cones 0.114 mm p 0.001.

RdCVF immunostaining was performed in the wholemount preparation of the neuroretina and RPE choroida sclera. The wholemounts were rinsed three times with 1 PBS and blocked with 5 donkey serum and 2 Triton X 100 in PBS for 2 hrs at RT. After removing blocking solution the wholemounts were sequentially incubated with the primary antibody rabbit anti RdCVF at 1 1 000 in blocking solution at 4 C. overnight and secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti rabbit at 1 1 000 and 2 Triton X 100 in PBS 2 hrs at RT. After final rinses with PBS each wholemount was flat mounted on a glass slide with photoreceptors facing upward for the neuroretina and RPE facing upward for the RPE choroid sclera. The flatmounts were then examined with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a digital camera Spot RT Color 2.2.1 Diagnostic Instruments Inc and epifluorescence.

Robust RdCVF immunoreactivity was observed in the RPE cells in 5 out of 6 rAAV RdCVF1L injected eyes a representative example from one eye is seen in but not from the uninjected contralateral eyes . One eye that received rAAV RdCVF1L injection was excluded from analysis due to microphthamia. Efficient expression of RdCVF1L was seen in the focal area spreading approximately 1.5 to 3 quadrants of each eye. RdCVF1L expressing RPE cells maintained typical hexagonal morphology suggesting there was no obvious negative impact on the RPE from the vector administration or the RdCVF1L expression. Similarly to RPE expression of RdCVF1L efficient expression in the immunoreactivity of this protein was also observed in neuroretina in the rAAV RdCVF1L injected eyes . There was no staining in the uninjected contralateral eyes . Strong RdCVF1L staining was clearly seen in the photoreceptor cells in 3 out of 5 eyes particularly in the inner outer segments . Lack of RdCVF immunoreactivity in the other 2 eyes may be attributed to photoreceptor degeneration. Again the positive staining was localized only in a focal area of the retina. The observation that no detectable expression of RdCVF1L in the uninjected contralateral eyes suggests that the level of endogenous RdCVF1L may be lower that the limit of detection by immunohistochemical staining.

This study demonstrated subretinal injection of rAAV RdCVF1L vectors led to efficient transduction of the RPE and photoreceptor cells and robust RdCVF1L protein expression in the rd10 mouse eyes. More importantly this vector prolonged both rod and cone photoreceptor survival and improved cone morphology in this clinically relevant animal model of retinitis pigmentosa RP .

To examine if rescue of photoreceptor cells by rAAV RdCVF1L can extend to the areas distant from the injection site rAAV RdCVF1L 1 L 2 10GC was subretinally injected into the superior quadrant of rd10 mouse right eyes at postnatal day 3 with the uninjected contralateral eyes as controls. Mice were sacrificed at 5 weeks old. Retinal histology from the entire eye cup was examined shows a light photomicrograph of an eyecup from a representative 5 week old rd10 mouse that received a subretinal injection of rAAV RdCVF1L in one eye Panel A and no treatment in the contralateral eye Panel B . Note the difference in ONL thickness between the treated and untreated eye. Photoreceptor preservation was clearly seen in the entire retina of rAAV RdCVF1L treated eye Panel A . The injection site in the superior retina was labeled. In contrast most photoreceptor cells were lost except in the inferior peripheral retina in the untreated contralateral eye Panel B .

To examine if the rod photoreceptor cells can be rescued in addition to cone photoreceptor cells by rAAV RdCVF1L the right eyes of rd10 mouse at postnatal day 3 were subretinally injected with rAAV RdCVF1L 1 L 2 10GC with the uninjected contralateral eyes as controls. Mice were sacrificed at 5 weeks old. Retinal tissue was subjected to rhodopsin immunohistochemical staining. The sections were counterstained with DAPI diamidino 2 phenylindole blue color to aid in identification of retinal layers.

Robust expression of rhodopsin was observed in both the segment layer and nuclear layer of photoreceptor cells in the rAAV RdCVF1L treated eye data not shown . However only a few cells showed rhodopsin staining in the untreated eye data not shown .

The purpose of this study was to assess the protective effect of RdCVF delivered by AAV vector on retinal function and structure in the rd10 mice. Neonatal rd10 mice at 3 or 4 days of age were injected subretinally with rAAV RdCVFL vector in one eye while the contralateral eye was left untreated. Five weeks after subretinal injection the mice were tested with electroretinogram ERG to evaluate retinal functions. After ERGs the mice were sacrificed and their eyes were processed for histological assessment of the retina.

Recombinant AAV serotype 2 vector rAAV RdCVF1L and control vector rAAV GFP were prepared as described in Example 2.

Breeding pairs of congenic inbred strain of rd10 mice 4 5 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. and bred at our animal facility. They were housed under a 12 hr light dark cycle with a light intensity of 

Mice were dark adapted overnight at least 14 hours before the experiments and their pupils dilated with 0.5 tropicamide Alkorn eye drops. Anesthesia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. Silver needle electrodes served as reference forehead and ground tail and DTL ring electrodes as active electrodes. Gonesol was applied to ensure good electrical contact and to keep the eye hydrated during the entire procedure. The recording setup featured a Ganzfeld bowl a DC amplifier and a computer based control and recording unit of the Espion E3 electroretinography system Diagnosys LLC Lowell Mass. . ERGs were recorded from both eyes simultaneously after the mice were placed in the Ganzfeld bowl. Single flash and flicker recordings were obtained both under dark adapted scotopic and light adapted photopic conditions. Single flash stimuli were presented with increasing intensities reaching from 10to 25 cds m. Five responses were averaged with an inter stimulus interval of 5 or 17 seconds. Flicker stimuli had an intensity of 3 cds mwith frequencies of 2 5 10 15 and 30 Hz. Light adaptation was performed with a background illumination of 30 cds mpresented for 10 minutes to reach a stable level of the photopic responses. For comparison of the mean amplitudes Student pair t test was used.

Mice were deeply anesthetized and marked their eyes at the superior quadrant with red tissue dye for orientation. They were then sacrificed and immediately enucleated and fixed in Davidson s fixative for about 24 hrs at room temperature. After sequential dehydration in ethanol and Clear rite eyes were embedded in paraffin Fisher Sci. Houston Tex. . Retinal sections of 5 m thickness were cut along the vertical meridian to allow examination of the superior and inferior retina. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope Olympus BX51 . The outer nuclear layer ONL thickness was evaluated by counting the number of rows of nuclei in the central and peripheral retina. Photoreceptor morphology was also examined.

As expected at the age of 5 weeks the rd10 mice showed a significant reduction of scotopic and photopic responses in ERG recording in comparison to the age matched wild typed C57BL 6 mice data not shown . However in the rd 10 mice n 8 the eyes treated with rAAV RdCVF1L showed an approximately 3 fold increase in b wave amplitudes 33.6 14 V as compared to the untreated fellow eyes 11.5 8.4 V under the flash intensity of 25 cd at the scotopic background . Under this condition both rod and cone responses were recorded. Statistical analyses indicate significant differences in ERG amplitudes between rAAV RdCVF1L treated eyes and the control eyes p 0.025 . Some animals n 5 were excluded from ERG testing excluded before ERG testing due to corneal opacity cataract or microphthalmia likely resulting from intraocular surgery at the neonatal period.

To determine whether the increased ERG responses in rAAV RdCVF1L treated eyes correlate with structural preservation of photoreceptor cells in the rd10 mice animals were sacrificed immediately after ERG. Their eyes were processed for histological evaluation. Light microscopy showed obvious preservation of outer nuclear layer ONL in the AAV RdCVFL treated eyes in comparison with untreated contralateral eyes. Typically the vector treated retina possessed 2 4 rows of photoreceptor nuclei in the superior and or inferior regions as opposed to 1 2 rows in the untreated contralateral eyes . The photoreceptor preservation was not limited to the injected area the superior quadrant as the protection was also observed in the inferior quadrant. Some preserved photoreceptors even possessed inner and outer segments. Morphometric analyses show a significant increases in the number of rows of ONL in treated eyes 2.5 1.0 in comparison with that in the control eyes 1.2 0.2 p 0.006 .

ERG demonstrated a significant increase in the amplitudes of b wave in rAAV RdCVF1L treated eyes 33.6 14 V in relative to the untreated fellow eyes 11.5 8.4 V . The increase in the ERG amplitudes was correlated with improvement of retinal structure. This study demonstrated subretinal injection of rAAV RdCVF1L vectors significantly improved retinal function and delayed photoreceptor degeneration in the Rd10 mice.
