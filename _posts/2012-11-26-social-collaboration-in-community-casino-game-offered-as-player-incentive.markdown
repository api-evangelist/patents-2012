This application is related by subject matter to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 685 378 filed Nov. 26 2012 entitled SLOTS FUELED ADVENTURE and issued on May 27 2014 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 734 234 and to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 483 971 filed May 30 2012 and entitled VIRAL PROGRESSIVE JACKPOT all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present embodiments relate to methods for executing a game and more particularly methods systems and computer programs for executing casino games.

The popularity of casino games has extended to casino games played online. Online games such as poker slots blackjack etc. are played on a computer by a large number of users. However most of the slot games in the market are very similar to the real life slot games that have been around for a long time and the online slot games merely seem to copy the user interface provided by the real slot machines without adding much to the online experience. Because of this differentiation between game providers is small.

Additionally social interaction in online games is appealing to many users that wish to share some of their gaming experience with other friends or other potential friends that may be made online. But existing slots online games do not currently provide many opportunities for social interaction with other players nor they provide gaming interactions with other players as the game of one slots player does not relate to the game of another slots player.

Methods devices systems and computer programs are presented for enhancing social collaboration in an online casino game. It should be appreciated that the present embodiments can be implemented in numerous ways such as a method an apparatus a system a device or a computer program on a computer readable medium. Several embodiments are described below.

In one embodiment a method includes an operation for receiving bets from players playing in a first gambling mode in an online gambling room. The method further includes an operation for determining contributions to a community metric based on the outcomes of the bets where all players in the online gambling room contribute towards the community metric. After detecting that the community metric reaches a predetermined goal the online casino game enters all players in the online gambling room into a second gambling mode to achieve a room goal where the value of the community metric does not change while players are in the second gambling mode where operations of the method are executed by a processor.

In another embodiment a method includes operations for receiving bets from players playing slots in a first gambling mode in an online gambling room and for determining contributions to a community progress bar based on outcomes of the bets where all players in the online gambling room contribute towards the community progress bar. After detecting that the community progress bar reaches a predetermined goal all players in the online gambling room are entered into a second gambling mode to achieve a room goal where the second gambling mode includes different slots wheels from the slots wheels in the first gambling mode. The value of the community progress bar does not change while players are in the second gambling mode.

In yet another embodiment a server includes a processor and a non transitory memory in communication with the processor. The non transitory memory includes program instructions for a game manager module operable to receive bets from players playing in a first gambling mode in an online gambling room program instructions for a spin manager module operable to determine outcomes of the bets and program instructions for a room manager operable to determine contributions to a community metric based on outcomes of the bets. All the players in the online gambling room contribute towards the community metric and the room manager is further operable to detect when the community metric reaches a predetermined goal. All the players in the online gambling room enter into a second gambling mode to achieve a room goal when the predetermined goal is reached where the value of the community metric does not change while players are in the second gambling mode.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The following embodiments describe a method and apparatus for executing a game. It will be apparent that the present embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments.

It is also noted that the embodiments described herein are described with reference to the slots online game but the principles may be utilized in other gambling online games as well as in real life gambling games. The embodiments described herein should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

The slots playing area includes slot wheels a chat area and buttons and counters related to the betting in the slots game. The wheels spin when the player presses e.g. clicks on the spin button . The player is able to enter the amount of lines to bet on each wheel spin. Each line includes a different combination of locations within each wheel. For example one line may include the five locations across the center line while other lines may form different combinations of locations such as the top location on the first three wheels followed by the center location on the fourth wheel and followed by the bottom location on the fifth wheel.

In bet field the player enters the amount being bet for each line and the total bet field indicates the total amount bet in the current spin. Counter indicates the amount of currency owned by the player for placing bets in the slots game. The total bet amount is equal to the number of lines times the bet per line . A maximum lines button provides a shortcut to the player for betting the maximum number of lines. When the player gets a winning combination of the wheels the total win field indicates the amount won. The chat area allows players in the same room to exchange messages with each other or with the whole community in the room.

In the adventure area an adventure game takes place that is inter link with the gambling game. A pet also referred to as an avatar or a mount advances along a road to get points overcome obstacles play mini games etc. To move the pet the player spins the slots situated below the adventure game and the prizes obtained in the slots cause the pet to advance in the adventure game.

In one embodiment the amount of progress made by the pet is proportional to the amount of winnings where if there are no winnings in a spin of the wheel then there is no advancement and if there is a win after spinning the wheel the advancements is proportional to the amount won. In another embodiment pet always makes some progress after spinning the wheel and the progress is proportional to the amount won where a little progress is made if there is no win in the slots and if there is a win in the slots then the progress is proportional to the win and is bigger than the progress made when no amount is won.

In one embodiment the gambling game and the adventure type game are interlinked which means that the some operations in one game affect the progress of the player in the other game. In another embodiment some operations in a first game affect the progress in a second game and some operations in the second game affect the progress in the first game.

In one embodiment the gambling game is selected from a group consisting of a slots game a poker game a blackjack game a bet on a sports event other casino games etc. For description purposes embodiments presented here utilize a slots game but the principles may be utilized for any type of gambling game.

In one embodiment the adventure type game includes an avatar that travels along the road and the progress of the avatar along the road as well as some of the rewards obtained by the avatar depend on the outcomes in the gambling game. In other embodiments the outcome in the gambling game may result in a plurality of operations in the adventure game such as advancing on the road traveling in different directions in a game map unlocking new game areas obtaining rewards obtaining new assets obtaining additional game currency for the adventure game etc.

In one embodiment even when the player loses the player obtains meta cash which can be used to buy virtual items but not to play the slots machine. In one embodiment the meta cash randomly appears on the road e.g. in the form of gems and as the pet collects the meta cash the meta cash is added to the meta cash counter . In addition the pet may find other rewards as the pet advances along the road such as special keys special gems energy etc.

Adventure progress bar is a graphical indicator of the progress made by the player along the road. In one embodiment the road is considered infinite because the road does not have a defined end. As the pet moves along the road adventure progress bar fills up and when the adventure progress bar is completely filled up some rewards are given to the player and the adventure progress bar is reset for example to start a new level.

Contribution progress bar shows the amount of contribution made by the player. As used herein the contribution measures how much the player has won independently on how much the player has bet. In one embodiment contribution would be the amount the player had won assuming the player had bet 1 even if the player bet a different amount . Contribution can also be thought as the sum of the bet multipliers obtained by the player. In a typical slots machine a winning table describes how much the player will win when the player obtains a winning combination where the amount won is equal to the amount bet times the bet multiplier associated with the respective winning combination. In one embodiment the contribution is equal to the figures listed in the winning table. As described below the contribution is sometimes used when fighting an enemy and the damage inflicted on the enemy is proportional to the contribution. This way the damage does not depend on the amount of money bet by the player thus avoiding the situation where big betting players would defeat the enemy easily.

The player may increase the damage inflicted on the boss by adding friends to the fighting crew. The more players that are added to the fighting group the bigger the damage multiplier i.e. contribution will be. Crew building interface lists one or more of the friends playing the game with the player. For each player an icon associated with the player is presented the name of the player the mount or pet of the player and a damage multiplier.

For example if one friend named Joe in this exemplary embodiment is added to the group then the contribution is multiplied by two and the damage to the common enemy will increase by a factor of two. If players and are added to the group then the damage multiplier is three etc.

In addition the player is given the option to invite other friends to participate in the upcoming battle. A button is provided in order to start the process to invite a friend such as by selecting a friend from a group of social links of the player or selecting some of the friends of the player in the game. The contribution increases when a friend is invited to participate in the battle. In one embodiment if the player selects several friends and or invites one or more friends the resulting contribution is a combination of the multipliers for the different options selected such as adding the contributions i.e. multipliers of the selected options to come up with the final contribution. But other calculations for calculating the contribution are also possible.

In one embodiment the community fights the dragon together and the damage inflicted on the dragon is based on the damage inflicted by all the players. In another embodiment each player fights her own dragon and the damage inflicted is based solely on the contribution by the single player.

Display area further includes a counter of the contribution made to date the number of lines unlocked by the player and a number of spears found by the player. In addition the display area further includes the crew if any that the player has assembled to fight the dragon which may include friends and one or more helpers provided by the game. The player has the option of adding helper pets to fight the enemy by spending virtual currency to acquire the helper pets.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts adventure games game themes betting mechanisms etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

Community progress bar shows the progress made by the players as a team in the current slots machine. As the players get winnings in the slots game the community progress bar gets filled to indicate the progress of the players as a group. Milestones in community progress bar define special locations that when reached by the group cause the game to reward the players provide a game challenge or perform some other game operation. In one embodiment when the group reaches milestone a special game operation takes place such as giving the players more energy or prices increasing the experience level providing a mini game battling against a common enemy etc. In the another embodiment when community progress bar gets completely full a challenge is presented to the room as a whole for example by fighting the dragon together. After the challenge is completed the community progress bar is reset back to the beginning i.e. the community progress bar is emptied or the value of a counter associated with the progress made in the community progress bar is reset to zero or to some other initial value.

The community approach to fill the community progress bar provides a collaborative experience to the players in the room because the players fill the community progress bar by working together. The players in the room do not compete against each other to fill the community progress bar but rather they cooperate to advance in the game.

As used herein the slots game is in a first gambling mode during the normal operation of the game that is when players are betting on the slot wheels in order to make progress in their adventure game and to fill the community progress bar. When the community progress bar gets filled the slots game enters into a second gambling mode also referred to herein as community task mode community game or community mini game where players bet on the slots and the winnings are used to determine the progress made towards fulfilling a community goal such as beating the dragon also referred to herein as a common enemy . In another embodiment the second gambling mode may also be entered when the community progress bar reaches a milestone. In one embodiment when the players are in the second gambling mode the value of the community metric i.e. the community progress bar does not change.

The embodiment shown in illustrates an exemplary community goal of beating the dragon which is also referred to as fighting a boss or fighting a common enemy . In other embodiments the community goal may be one of fighting a boss building a vehicle building a house building a bridge building some other object clearing an obstacle in the road destroying a wall clearing a minefield destroying a tank destroying an army destroying an airplane killing threatening animals etc.

In the illustrated embodiment of when the community progress bar gets filled dragon appears on the road and the pet of the player has to fight the dragon together with the fellow players in the room. In one embodiment the players have a predetermined amount of time e.g. 30 seconds although other periods are also possible to fight the dragon. Health bar shows the remaining life or health left in the dragon which is named Rane in this example. A clock indicates the amount of time left in the battle.

In one embodiment the slot wheels of the first gambling mode are different from the slot wheels in the second gambling mode. The slot wheels are thematic that is the wheels follow the theme of the first gambling mode or the second gambling mode. For example while fighting the dragon the wheels include icons of weapons such as swords spears shields knives etc.

In one embodiment the damage inflicted on the common enemy is proportional to the amounts won by the players when playing the slots. If the common enemy is defeated in the allotted time then all the players in the room get rewards. However if the common enemy is not defeated the first gambling mode is resumed without getting rewards or getting fewer rewards than if the common enemy were defeated. In one embodiment the status of the common enemy is persistent which means that the parameters associated with the common enemy e.g. health are kept in the game and the next time that the room fights the common enemy the common enemy starts with the saved parameters e.g. with the saved amount of health instead of starting a new battle.

As previously discussed in one embodiment the common enemy is fought together by the whole room while in another embodiment each player fights her own enemy. Further in one embodiment the damage inflicted on the dragon is based on player winnings. In another embodiment the damage inflicted on the enemy is based on player contribution.

From operation the method flows to operation where the bets in the gambling game are processed by the game server. More details regarding operation are given below with reference to .

From operation the method flows to operation where the game server processes operations in the game related to the community progress bar. More details regarding operation are given below with reference to .

From operation the method flows to operation where the outcome of the bet is sent to the player s game device i.e. the client device. In operation a check is performed to determine if the player had a big win. The rules for determining what a big win is are set by game designers. If the player did not get a big win the method flows back to operation to wait for another user bet. However if the player received a big win in the gambling game the method flows to operation where the game determines which players in the gambling game will get a share of the win and the amount of the share.

From operation the method flows to operation where update messages that include the share of the big win are sent to the fortunate players that are sharing in the big win. From operation the method flows back to operation to wait for a new user bet.

From operation the method flows to operation to perform a check to determine if a milestone in the community progress bar or the end of the community progress bar has been reached. If the milestone or the end have been reached the method flows to operation and to operation otherwise.

In operation the game enters a second gambling mode which includes performing a community task e.g. fighting a common enemy . From operation the method flows to operation where updates are sent to the client devices in order to notify the devices that the community task mode has started. In one embodiment once the community task mode starts the interface for the gambling game changes such as in the embodiment shown in .

In operation the parameters associated with the community task are updated based on the progress made by players in the second gambling mode. For example as players when in the slots game the health of the common enemy is decreased based on the winnings of the players. In operation updates regarding the parameters associated with the enemy are sent to the players in the room.

In operation a check is made to determine if the second gambling mode has terminated. If the second gambling mode has not terminated the method flows to operation and if the second gambling mode has ended then the method flows to operation where the community task is ended. Updates are sent to the client devices in order to communicate that the community task has ended. In addition results regarding the community task performance are also sent to the players in one embodiment.

In operation the community progress bar is reset if the community progress bar has been filled or in other words the completion of the community progress bar caused the start of the community task. From operation the method flows to operation where the players enter the first gambling mode.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different operations additional operations or have different game modules perform some of the operations. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

By showing the leaderboard players are encouraged to do better than other players which introduces a competition aspect to the group effort. In the embodiment of the dragon still has 60 percent of life remaining and the next time the community or the player alone confronts the dragon the dragon will start with 60 percent of life remaining. In other words the parameters associated with the common task e.g. the life of the dragon are persistent and do not disappear at the end of this episode of the community task.

In one embodiment players may give other players recognition or appreciation for a good performance in the common task. This recognition is referred to herein as a prop. In one embodiment one or more of the top performers are displayed with an option button titled Props. If a player clicks in the props button a counter of props associated with the selected player is incremented. This way as the player gets recognition from peers the props counter increases giving a measurement of the level of recognition or popularity of the player in the game.

In one embodiment as a player receives more and more props some recognition animation is performed in the board of the player such as fireworks flags banners messages of recognition etc. This positive reinforcement encourages the player to work for the community in order to increase the number of props.

In another embodiment the player may also get props after a big win during the first gambling mode. Since some players share some of the winnings after getting a big win other players are motivated to give props to the winner of the big win because the big win results in rewards for the players sharing the good fortune.

In general players may be able to receive props from other players for additional reasons such as being an active participant in the chat board or providing encouragement to other players etc. It is also noted that community progress bar is reset to a zero level at the end of the community task.

In one embodiment an animation is shown in the screens of other players to indicate the sharing of the big win. The animation includes dropping gems or some other asset on the road and the pet of the player picks up the dropping gems as the pet advances on the road. In the embodiment of a witch flies by the path of the adventure game while dropping gems that are later collected by the players pets.

In one embodiment the server detects when a player gets a big jackpot i.e. a big win and proceeds to place the shared rewards e.g. gems on the road or to give the rewards to players in some other fashion. In one embodiment the rewards given to players are different for friends and for non friends. In one embodiment friends get more rewards than non friends.

The rules for sharing include parameters associated with the rules such as the size of the minimum jackpot won by a player in order to share the good fortune with other players what are the amounts that are shared with other players when to share with friends or with non friends in the game etc.

In one embodiment game manager manages the game operations for each of the players and interacts with other modules to perform respective game operations within the game. In addition the game manager manages the game data stored for running the player s games although other modules may also access and change some of the game data. In one embodiment the functionality implemented by game manager includes presenting the game board to the player e.g. including the gambling game and the adventure game presenting options to the player for customizing and controlling an avatar or mount of the game providing an interface between the player and other game modules synchronizing game operations with client managing communications with client etc.

Spin manager manages the gambling operations in the game. In one embodiment spin manager controls the amount that may be wagered by the player in the gambling game e.g. number of lines amount bet per line etc. . In one embodiment spin manager receives a betting instruction from client and performs a game simulation regarding the chance game being played. For example the spin manager spins the wheels and determines the outcome of the spinning including a possible win amount. The calculation of prizes is also referred to as game mechanics for calculating prizes in the slots game. The calculation is based on game rules and a degree of randomness related to the game of chance.

The probability of winning is driven by data set up by game designers. The design data specifies the symbols on the wheels the combinations that result in payouts the odds etc. In one embodiment the spin manager exchanges information with the road manager to determine when players are in a first gambling mode or in a second gambling mode. As discussed above in the first gambling mode players that in the gambling game to obtain virtual currency and other prices and also cooperate with other players in the room to fill the community progress bar. In the second gambling mode the players in the room cooperate to achieve a community task different from filling up the community progress bar.

After calculating the result of the spin spin manager sends the result back to the client game . In another embodiment the spinning of the wheels is performed in the client device and the client device synchronizes with spin manager to share the results of the betting operations in the gambling game.

Room manager manages the gambling room the place where a plurality of players play the gambling game while also cooperating on same game objectives. In a way each player has its own personal game with its own personal objectives but all the players also share one common game that is interrelated with the individual games.

In one embodiment the common game relates to a community progress bar and involves some periods of cooperation such as when all the players in the room work together to beat a dragon that appears in the adventure game. In one embodiment there is collaboration in the game and as every player spins and gets points the bar gets filled for the whole room. All player devices such has player device in the same room provide updates to the server so the room manager may calculate the progress of the room in the progress bar. Therefore the clients send updates to the server and the server periodically sends out the current state of the community progress bar e.g. every five seconds although other periods are also possible . In one embodiment the frequency of updates is determined by the game designers and is kept in design data .

In addition room manager periodically checks the position of each of the players in the room within the road of the adventure game. In one embodiment when two friends are in the same area in the road room manager sends updates to each player so the GUI of each player displays the name or some other symbol associated with the friend. In one embodiment to increase the awareness of other players being in the room room manager will also send instructions to display the pets from some players that are not friends in order to see more traffic in the game road. If the game road has a large number of players not all players are displayed on the road because it would lead to congestion in the screen.

Social manager manages the social interactions of the players which include determining the social links established within the game and outside the game among the players. For example the social manager may suggest friends in the social network to the player that may become friends within the game.

Game data represents one or more databases that hold game related data. In one embodiment game data includes player data room data design data and social data . Social data includes the relationships established by players in the game within the game and the relationships existing among the players in one or more social websites.

Design manager provides an interface to the game designers in order to configure the different parameters for operating the game. In addition the design manager manages the design data which is utilized by the different game modules to determine the outcome of certain game operations in the game such as winning a bet collecting gems on the road or determining which mounts are available at which levels.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different game modules different data modules or combine the functionality of one or more modules into a single module. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the challenge involves traveling a certain amount of miles in an adventure game associated with the gambling game. The traveling for the challenge is the sum of the distance traveled by all the players that participate in the team challenge. In other embodiments other types of measurements for the team challenge are also possible such as winning a certain amount of virtual currency performing certain community tasks e.g. defeating the dragon a certain number of times etc. Goals message provides team challenge information for the team challenge such as the number of players currently enrolled the amount of distance traveled to date the total amount of distance required to complete the challenge the mount or pet required for the team challenge e.g. a deer etc. Name describes the name for the team challenge which may be provided by the game or renamed by the player initiating the team challenge.

The initiator of the team challenge may invite friends to participate in the team challenge and the invited friends may invite their friends and so on. The more players participate in the team challenge the easier it is to complete the team challenge. In one embodiment the requirement to complete the challenge is not a function of the number of players participating. Therefore the more players that participate in the team challenge the easier it is to complete the team challenge.

In another embodiment the goal to complete the team challenge is a function of the number of players participating. For example a team challenge with 10 players may have lower requirements than a team challenge with 1000 players. However in order to encourage viral participation the requirements may not be linear that is the goal for 1000 players is not equal to 100 times the goal for 10 players. In one embodiment the more players that participate the higher the goal but the more players participate the smaller the requirement per player is. The requirement per player is defined as the total requirement to complete the team challenge divided by the number of players in the team.

In order to make progress in the team challenge a player participates in the game as previously discussed with reference to etc. But the game keeps track of the progress made in the gambling game in order to update the progress counter in the team challenge bar.

In one embodiment when the player clicks or mouses over an icon at the end of the team challenge bar and information message is displayed. The information message includes the amount of time left in the challenge an option to invite other friends the amount of party points awarded by the game an option to use the party points etc. A party point is a special game asset available to players in the team challenge. A counter provides a value e.g. 525 miles for the amount of progress made in team challenge bar .

As players make progress in the team challenge party points are awarded to the players and these party points may be used to acquire assets in the game such as energy endurance additional bonus traveled miles in the team challenge etc. The more players play in the gambling game the more party points they get. The party points applies only to the team and in one embodiment there is not a separate party point counter for each of the players.

As players are active in the game the team challenge bar fills up. Therefore as players play in the gambling game the progress made by betting in the gambling game translates into progress made in the community progress bar of and into progress towards filling the team challenge bar . In GUI the players currently enrolled in the challenge bar are presented. In one embodiment each player display includes an icon or photo associated with the player the name and the amount contributed towards the team challenge .

In one embodiment clicking or mousing over a player provides information regarding the player in the team challenge. The information may include the name of the player the level of the player in the gambling game the amount of contribution to the team challenge e.g. miles traveled an option to send a gift to the player an option to view the complete profile of the player in the game etc.

In addition an icon is presented to give the player the option to invite more friends to the team challenge. In one embodiment a player that invites other players to play the team challenge gets rewarded with some game asset and in another embodiment the player gets an additional reward if the friend invited joins the team challenge.

If the team fills out the team challenge bar prizes or rewards are given to each of the members of the team. In addition when the team reaches a milestone in the team challenge bar additional rewards might be given to the players such as additional energy or party points. In one embodiment all the players get the same rewards when reaching the milestone at the end of the team challenge bar but in another embodiment players are rewarded according to their contribution.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts options challenges measurements of progress different types of challenges etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

From operation the method flows to operation where the game sets up the team challenge and the parameters associated with the team challenge game. The parameters may include one or more of a name for the team challenge the amount of time allowed for accomplishing the team challenge the rewards given for completing the team challenge or completing milestones in the team challenge the requirements for completing the team challenge requirements for making progress in the team challenge in the gambling game etc.

From operation the method flows to operation where the new players detected wishing to participate in the team challenge are added to the team challenge. In one embodiment there are participating rules for players to join a team challenge such as being friend in the game or in the social network of one of the existing members of the team. In another embodiment any player may join the team challenge and in yet another embodiment membership to the team challenge is controlled by the creator of the team challenge which means that new members must first be approved by the team challenge creator.

From operation the method flows to operation where the game monitors the play of the team members including tracking the bets and winnings of the team members in the gambling game. Based on the outcomes of the bets in the gambling game the team challenge counter is updated. In one embodiment the team challenge counter is one of the metrics utilized for determining that the team has completed the team challenge.

In operation periodic updates are sent to the team members currently playing the team challenge with information regarding the progress of the team made in the team challenge. In operation a check is made to determine if the goal or goals for the team challenge have been met. If the goals have been met the method flows to operation were prizes are awarded to the team members and the team challenge is deemed complete.

If the goals have not been met the method flows to operation where a check is made to determine if the time allotted for completing the team challenge has expired. If the time has expired the method flows to operation where the team challenge is terminated and consolation prizes are distributed to the team members. If the time has not expired the method flows back to operation .

From operation the method flows to operation where the game determines the contributions to a community metric that is based on the outcomes of the bets placed in the gambling game. In one embodiment all the players in the online gambling room contribute towards the community metric. In other words there is no competition among the players in the online game to contribute towards the community metric.

From operation the method flows to operation where the game detects that the community metric has reached a predetermined goal or on of the milestones associated with the community metric. In one embodiment the community metric is based on a community progress bar and the community metric is the advancement of the community progress bar which is filled when the players bet in the gambling game.

From operation the method flows to operation where in response to the detection of the predetermined goal in operation the players in the online gambling room are entered into a second gambling mode. When the players are in the second gambling mode the players cooperate to achieve a room goal and in the second gambling mode the value of the community metric does not change.

When a player provides an input into the player s client device the client device may in response send a message via the communications network to the social networking server. The social networking server may update the player profile save the message to a database send messages to other players etc. The social gaming network may include a social graph database which stores player relationships social player profiles player messages and player social data.

The gaming servers host one or more gaming applications and perform the computations necessary to provide the gaming features to the players and clients. One or more gaming databases store data related to the gaming services such as the gaming applications and modules virtual gaming environment data player gaming session data player scores player virtual gaming profiles game stage levels etc. The gaming servers may utilize the data from the gaming databases to perform the computations related to providing gaming services for the players.

Room Servers manage the slot rooms system in the game including the creation tracking expiration abandonment and deletion of rooms. In addition a room database holds room information and design db holds information data.

Each game server has access to one or more game databases for keeping game data. In addition a single database can store game data for one or more online games. Each game server may also include one or more levels of caching. Game data cache is a game data cache for the game data stored in game databases . For increased performance caching may be performed in several levels of caching. For instance data more frequently used is stored in a high priority cache while data requiring less access during a session will be cached and updated less frequently.

The number of game servers changes over time as the gaming platform is an extensible platform that changes the number of game servers according to the load on the gaming infrastructure. As a result the number of game servers will be higher during peak playing times and the number of game servers will be lower during off peak hours. In one embodiment the increase or decrease of bandwidth is executed automatically based on current line usage or based on historical data.

One or more social network management servers provide support for the social features incorporated into the online games. The social network management servers access social data from one or more social networks via Application Programming Interfaces API made available by the social network providers. An example of a social network is Facebook but it is possible to have other embodiments implemented in other social networks. Each social network includes social data and this social data or a fraction of the social data is made available via API . As in the case of the game servers the number of social network management servers that are active at a point in time changes according to the load on the infrastructure. As the demand for social data increases the number of social network management servers increases. Social network management servers cache user data in database and social data in database . The social data may include the social networks where a player is present the social relationships for the player the frequency of interaction of the player with the social network and with other players etc. Additionally the user data kept in database may include the player s name demographics e mail games played frequency of access to the game infrastructure etc.

It is noted that the embodiment illustrated in is an exemplary online gaming infrastructure. Other embodiments may utilize different types of servers databases APIs etc. and the functionality of several servers can be provided by a single server or the functionality can be spread across a plurality of distributed servers. The embodiment illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.
