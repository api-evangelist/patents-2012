The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and more particularly a method for forming a nanopillar and cap structure for the fabrication of STT RAM.

Certain electronic devices such as STT RAM require that a plurality of rings of a magnetoresistive stack be deposited on a substrate. These rings have been previously formed by ion beam milling which creates the center hole for the ring. Ion beam milling however suffers from a number of disadvantages.

One disadvantage of the ion beam milling is that the process is serial and for that reason very slow in manufacturing time. Such ion beam milling also leads to the redeposition of the magnetic tunnel junction material on the nanoring surface which leads to shorting of the device.

Another process that is currently used to create the rings of magnetoresistive material on the substrate for STT RAM involves the reactive ion etching of the magnetic tunnel junction. In this method methanol is used to assist with the etching process. A primary disadvantage of this process however is that it is only possible to etch 20 30 nm in the vertical direction with this process. With an STT RAM application however that is insufficient.

A final process that is currently used to form the rings of magnetoresistive material for STT RAM involves the use of polystyrene nanospheres. In particular it has been shown that it is possible to define the center hole of the nanoring using an ordered array of nanospheres. However in practice it has proven difficult to obtain an ordered array on a large scale area. Instead the nanospheres tend to be arranged in a hexagonal array that is less than ideal for forming the contacts involving random access memory such as STT RAM.

The present invention provides a method for forming nanopillar and cap structures on a substrate that is particularly useful for manufacturing STT RAM. However the method of the present invention may also be used for other types of products such as membranes filters and other ring shaped devices.

In brief in a first embodiment of the invention a substrate is spin coated with a negative resist having a high exposure dose to electron beam radiation. After the first negative resist is baked a negative resist having a low exposure dose to electron beam radiation is spin coated on top of the first negative resist and baked.

Thereafter electron beam lithography at a high level dose is performed in the areas of the nanopillar to expose the first negative resist. Electron beam lithography is then performed at a low dose in the areas of the caps to expose the second negative resist. Thereafter both the first and second negative resists are developed so that the bilayer resist structure forms both the nanopillar as well as the cap on top of the nanopillar that is greater in cross sectional area than the nanopillar.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention a substrate is spin coated with a positive resist having a low exposure dose to electron beam radiation. After the first positive resist is baked a positive resist having a high exposure dose to electron beam radiation is spin coated on top of the first positive resist and baked.

Thereafter electron beam lithography at a high level dose is performed in the areas between the caps of each of the structures to expose both layers of positive resist. Electron beam lithography is then performed at a low dose in the areas of the cap where the nanopillar is not present. Thereafter both the first and second positive resists are developed so that the bilayer resist structure forms both the nanopillar as well as the cap on top of the nanopillar that is greater in cross sectional area than the nanopillar.

Once the nanopillar and cap structures are formed on the substrate STT RAM may then be produced by first depositing a tunneling magnetoresistive stack over the caps and exposed areas of the substrate. A sidewall spacer is then formed on top of each cap wherein each sidewall spacer has a portion that extends laterally outwardly from its associated cap so that the nanoring is defined between the outer periphery of the sidewall spacer and the nanopillar.

Thereafter the tunneling magnetoresistive stack is etched so that only the portions of the tunneling magnetoresistive stack covered by the sidewall spacer and around the nanopillar remain. The sidewall spacers are then removed in any conventional way such as a chemical etch and a dielectric layer is then deposited over the remaining portions of the tunneling magnetoresistive stack. After planarizing via micromachining the electrical contact for the nanoring is then deposited on top of the insulating material covering the nanoring.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention the substrate is covered with a layer of first positive resist and second positive resist thus forming a bilayer resist structure. Thereafter electron beam lithography is performed at a high level dose in the areas of the nanopillar to expose both layers of positive resist. Electron beam lithography is carried out at a low exposure dose in the areas of the cap in order to expose the second positive resist. The positive resists are then developed thus removing the exposed areas and leaving a template for the nanopillar and cap structure.

Thereafter a material such as silicon or silicon dioxide is deposited on the substrate so that the deposited material forms both the nanopillar and its associated cap. Thereafter the device such as an STT RAM device is manufactured in the same fashion as the first embodiment of the invention.

With reference first to a substrate is illustrated which is constructed of any conventional material such as silicon. An insulating layer which may be constructed of silicon dioxide is deposited over a top surface of the substrate . For a bottom contact a positive resist is spin coated onto layer and patterned using electron beam lithography. The bottom contact is thereafter deposited and a lift off process is carried out to remove the excess bottom contact material.

With reference now to a first negative resist layer of the type used with electron beam lithography is coated over the contact layer . Any conventional means may be used to coat the first resist layer over the contact layer such as by spin coating the first resist over the contact layer . The first resist layer furthermore possesses a high exposure dose for electron beam lithography.

Still referring to after the first resist layer has been baked a second negative resist layer is coated over the first resist layer in any conventional fashion such as by spin coating. The second resist layer however has a lower exposure dose to electron beam lithography than the first resist layer . The layers and thus form a bilayer resist structure on top of the substrate .

In an alternative embodiment of the invention a first positive electron beam resist layer is coated over the contact layer using spin coating. The first positive resist layer would possess a low exposure dose for electron beam lithography. After the first resist layer has been baked a second positive resist layer would be spin coated over the first resist layer and baked. The second positive resist layer would have a higher exposure dose to electron beam lithography than the first resist layer . Layers and would once again form a bilayer resist structure on top of the substrate .

Assuming that the resist layers and are negative e beam resists the resist layers and are then subjected to a double exposure of electron beam lithography. In one exposure a high dose of electron beam is applied to the areas in the first resist layer which form the areas of the nanopillars. The high energy dose of electron beam energy thus hardens the first resist layer only in the areas where nanopillars are desired.

During the second exposure the resist layers and are exposed to a lower energy electron beam radiation in the areas where the caps are desired. These caps overlie their associated nanopillar area and are greater in cross sectional size than their associated nanopillar area . During this radiation however the first resist layer is unaffected by the electron beam radiation due to its higher exposure dose. Furthermore either the high or lower energy electron beam radiation during the electron beam lithography may be first formed followed by the second electron beam exposure.

Assuming that the resist layers and are positive e beam resists the areas between the caps of each of the structures would be subject to a high electron beam dose. After exposure is complete a low electron beam dose would be applied in the areas of the caps where the nanopillars do not reside. During the second exposure the second positive resist layer is unaffected by the electron beam radiation due to its higher exposure dose.

With reference now to following the double electron beam exposure the unexposed portions of the resist layers and when using negative resists exposed portions of the resist layers and when using positive resists are removed in any conventional fashion such as a resist developer thus leaving the nanopillar and cap on the substrate which as described actually contains several different layers and and the bottom contact .

Each nanopillar is formed from the first resist layer and each cap is formed from the second resist layer . The resulting pillar and cap structure may be used in many different applications such as STT RAM membranes filters and other ring shaped devices.

For example with reference to in order to manufacture STT RAM a tunneling magnetoresistive stack is first deposited over the substrate and caps . The tunneling magnetoresistive TMR stack is conventional in construction and includes an anti ferromagnetic layer a ferromagnetic fixed layer and an insulating barrier oxide and a ferromagnetic free layer .

With reference now to a sidewall spacer is then deposited over each cap by any conventional method such as atomic layer deposition. This sidewall spacer furthermore has a cross sectional size greater than the cap . Consequently the area of the TMR stack between the outer periphery of the spacer and the outer periphery of the cap forms a ring which is round in shape. The excess TMR stack is then etched away using conventional methods thus leaving the TMR stack forming the ring below the sidewall spacer . The sidewall spacer is then removed in any conventional fashion such as a chemical etch thus leaving the TMR ring structure shown in . With reference now to in order to complete the STT RAM the top surface of the overall device is first planarized as shown in layer using any conventional method. The device is then coated with positive resist and patterned. Electrical contacts are then deposited on top of each ring and lift off is carried out to remove the excess material thus completing the STT RAM device as shown in .

With reference now to in a second embodiment of the invention the first positive resist layer and second positive resist layer are coated over the substrate in the previously described fashion. However rather than forming the nanopillar and cap structures from the bilayer resist material a bilayer resist material is instead used to form a template for the deposition of other material such as silicon or silicon dioxide to form the nanopillar and cap structure.

More specifically the positive e beam resist layer is coated over the substrate by any conventional method such as spin coating and a second positive e beam resist layer is then coated over the first resist layer in any conventional fashion such as by spin coating. As before the first resist layer has a higher beam exposure than the second resist layer . The resist layers and are then subjected to a dual exposure electron beam radiation.

In one exposure the areas where the nanopillars are desired are exposed to high level electron beam. Similarly the second and lower energy electron beam exposure is performed in the areas where the caps are desired i.e. overlying and of greater cross sectional area than the nanopillar . At the completion of the dual exposure the positive resists are removed from areas and using a resist developer. The rest of the substrate remains covered with the resist layers and so that the bilayer resist structure forms a template for the nanopillars and caps.

With reference now to a material such as silicon or silicon dioxide is then deposited over the substrate thus filling the areas and defining the pillars and caps respectively. Following that deposition the remaining portions of the resist layers and are removed in any conventional fashion such as a resist remover thus leaving the nanopillar and cap structure on the substrate structure as shown in . The subsequent manufacture of an electronic device such as an STT RAM may then be performed in the fashion previously described.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple yet effective way of forming nanopillars and cap structures on a substrate. In describing our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those of skill in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the independent claims.
