No. 61 509 918 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BRAND MANAGEMENT USING SOCIAL NETWORKS which was filed on Jul. 20 2012 and is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 555 063 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BRAND MANAGEMENT USING SOCIAL NETWORKS which was also filed on Jul. 20 2012 the specifications of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention is in the field of brand management software solutions and more particularly in the field of using data pertaining to social media to identify recommended actions for optimally managing a brand.

Social networks have become one of the dominant forms of consumer interaction with the Internet in the last few years. Accordingly numerous innovations have been made by various players to add advertising capabilities and to otherwise aid in the monetization of social network traffic. As these social networks have become so dominant enterprises particularly those with strong consumer brands have moved more or less vigorously to adopt social networks for corporate use. It is commonplace today for example for consumer brands and some business to business brands as well to monitor social networks closely particularly Facebook and Twitter in order to gage how their customers perceive the brands and the products associated with them. Moreover many companies today are attempting to engage in meaningful conversations with consumers both customers and prospective customers using social media for example by responding to complaints made in social media that is content associated with social networks or by identifying community influencers and attempting to market to those individuals to reinforce a company s brand.

Several challenges are emerging as these trends take place. Because there are several social networks that are relevant to any given brand each with its own usage paradigm it is difficult for brand managers to collate content from various social networks and make sense of it as an overall picture of what a particular brand s perception among consumers is.

The inventor has developed a system and method for providing automated recommendations to users for brand management using social media the recommendations being driven by data collected from social media systems and analyzed according to various embodiments of the invention. The invention comprises a data collection system which gathers data from a plurality of social media networks and ancillary sources a data analysis system which analyzes the collected data to assess brand performance of target brands a user interface that allows brand managers and other users to establish goals monitor brand presence in social media review and adopt recommendations intended to achieve the established goals and measure progress in actual goal achievement and an optimization software module coupled to the data analysis system that uses analysis results to determine an optimum set of recommendations for each user to achieve the user s identified goals taking particularly into account previous results in response to previous goals and actions taken to achieve those goals.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a system for brand management using social networks is disclosed. The embodiment comprises an application server a plurality of social network crawler software modules a plurality of third party service integration software modules an analytics server a report generator a search engine a behavioral analysis engine a recommendation engine and a database. A user registers and provides data pertaining to a brand. Upon retrieving content from a plurality of social networks pertaining to the brand the analytics server module analyzes the content to a content value specific to the brand among members of the social networks. The behavioral analysis engine obtains content elements generated by a first member a social network and analyzes the first member s behavior to compute an audience value of the first member. The report generator prepares reports specific to the brand the reports comprising at least indicia of content value indicia of audience value and recommendations for improving member engagement with the brand.

According to various embodiments of the invention various systems and methods provide multi social multichannel stream integration meaning streams of updates from multiple social networks received via multiple channels may be integrated into one or more single feed update streams which may in turn be provided to users in various ways such as via use of widgets in web pages via mobile applications and the like . Various embodiments may provide a common scoring system for user generated content providing an ability to have a common engagement and influence score for user generated content from multiple social networks and multiple channels utilizing behavioral analysis of content creators and analysis of audience engagement with specific content. According to various embodiments identification and personalization of user generated testimonials may be provided giving users an ability to determine positive testimonial endorsement through analysis of content creators content types and content engagement by audiences. The invention may provide an ability to surface a personalized set of testimonials based on identifying information such as web visitor cookies or social network login data mapping many attributes from the testimonial. Moreover various embodiments may provide for indexing of testimonials providing an ability to track measure and score testimonials using many attributes such as user feedback user tagging user and content segmentation and the like. Various embodiments of the invention may provide integration into enterprise and e commerce systems giving users an ability to integrate social media with enterprise and e commerce systems. This may for example enable posting of testimonials with direct tagging to connect testimonials to product catalog information. Users may be provided with an ability to curate publish and measure testimonials based on product catalog information. Various embodiments may provide an enhanced testimonial process whereby the system may generate score index publish and measure user generated testimonials from multiple channels and multiple social networks thus providing a closed loop process for brand management.

According to an embodiment of the invention the system gathers data from a plurality of social media networks. Data is collected on behalf of users both individual and enterprise users and the data collection system of the invention gathers data using a variety of approaches. In one approach data pertaining to identified competitors of a given user is obtained as well as data regarding the user or the user s organization in order to establish overall sentiment levels among consumers toward the competitors brands to monitor trends in those levels and to compare the competitors social marketing effectiveness against that of the user or the user s organization. Competitors may be identified explicitly by users or may be identified implicitly by the system for instance by using search terms normally associated with the user s business within a search engine and then parsing the search results to identify other participants in the user s market and then monitoring social media networks for mentions of the potential competitors. In some embodiments information found pertaining to a potential competitor is compared to information provided either explicitly by the user or obtainable from the user s public website in order to determine how closely related the potential competitor s business is to the user s business. Users may be asked to confirm implicit competitor selection and in some embodiments an iterative process of management of a competitor list is undertaken with potential competitors added as required and with non competitors removed from the list either automatically or by user intervention.

Another source of data is general industry insights made available by journalists bloggers analysts and the like. And finally of course information is proactively gathered from a wide range of social media networks. Such information may be gathered entirely automatically for instance in an embodiment of the invention by a set of search queries generated by semantic analysis of the user s website and optionally a corpus of marketing documents provided by the user and then parsing a large number of web pages identified in the search results in order to identify both competitors as discussed above and industry commentators. In addition data is gathered not only specifically about a user and his company his competitors and his general industry but also more broadly about how consumers tend to behave generally on various social media networks in various situations. According to the invention as more data pertaining to consumer behaviors is obtained the system will be able to better contextualize new behaviors and thereby to classify user s sentiments and actions in terms of acceptance or not of a given brand and its core promises or messages.

An important aspect of the present invention is the establishment by a user of goals pertaining to brand or product management. For instance goals might include achieve greater reach on Twitter or counter negative press about a particular situation using social media or improve consumer brand engagement . These goals are generally established by a user in a web based user interface although mobile user interfaces are also contemplated by the inventor and of course users may in some cases still prefer to use so called thick or rich clients accessing the services of the invention via web services or any other web based programming interface method known in the art . According to the invention each goal is associated with a plurality of metrics which either directly or indirectly are suitable for measuring a user s company s or brand s progress in achieving the goal. For instance if a goal is achieve greater reach on Twitter then obviously a key metric will be the number of followers on Twitter that the user s brand or company or even the user herself has. Less obvious metrics in this situation might include for example a rate of growth of the number of Twitter followers or a weighted follower count wherein weights for a given network member are established based on the member s social connectivity and likelihood of a given member s retransmitting or commenting content provided by the user s company or the user herself .

Metrics used to measure progress toward goals are measured with respect to a user s company or brand but also with respect to the user s competitors and to the general industry and industry segments to which the user s brand or company belongs. In this way a key benefit of the invention the comparison of a user s brand performance either at a specific time or dynamically as a function of time to that of competitors and applicable industries and industry segments is made possible by preferred embodiments of the invention. Such comparisons greatly assist users in understanding where there are areas for improvement and where things are going well. Metrics are generally made available to the user via a web interface that supports a variety of well established reporting methods known in the art including drill down to allow a user to access more detailed information in order to investigate the causes for an observed phenomenon for example when progress against a metric is not meeting expectations despite the user s having carried out several recommendations . In addition direct and derived metrics are used by the system of the invention to analyze effectiveness of actions taken and to learn from the analysis what types of actions whether recommended by the system or undertaken on a user s initiative directly lead to what types of measurable results. These correlations actions to metrics changes may vary from industry to industry from company or brand to company or brand and even between social media networks for example user behaviors on LinkedIn are generally quite different from those on Facebook because users tend to use the two social media networks for quite different purposes .

According to the invention once a user has provided a set of goals and once a body of metrics is in place to assess where the user s organization stands with respect to those goals an optimization software module of the invention determines via one of several algorithmic approaches a plurality of recommendations to be made by the system to the user. Recommendations are determined based on what is most likely to move a user s key metrics closer to one or more goal states sets of metric values that reflect satisfactory achievement of at least one of the user defined goals . In some cases correlations between possible actions and goal based metrics as in the case of grow my reach on Twitter by getting me to 5000 followers by September 1st to measure progress toward the goal one merely needs to compute a current follower count a recent follower count and one can readily compute a rate of growth of follower count to determine if the goal is likely to be met. Of course when there is more data available in this case many daily or weekly follower counts then more refined prediction techniques many of which are well known in the art may be used. In other cases however correctly identifying actions that if taken will tend to move a client closer to achieving a goal can be quite challenging in less straightforward situations. For example it may not be clear at all what actions will positively affect the goal of improving brand engagement . In such cases a combination of heuristics may be created by humans either the user or a member of staff of an organization providing services according to the invention to a plurality of users or by automated means for example use of neural networks to determine best fit recommendation sets for a given type of goal. To facilitate use of automated recommendation generation in some embodiments a number of predefined goals with configurable parameters are established by the system operator to facilitate at once both the establishment of goals by users or clients and maintaining a high proportion of use of pre established goals for which well defined recommendation sets have been developed in advance. As examples of recommendations that may be generated by the system according to the invention users may receive recommendations from the system of any of the following types recommended content actions such as posting at least one blog post on product advantages per week in some embodiments provides an example of a piece of content such as for example text one or more links a video or a photo actions to be taken such as establishing a Facebook fan page for the user s organization best practices based on industry exemplars such as adopting an industry standard set of privacy terms to encourage user adoption and trust in most embodiments systems according to the invention will maintain libraries of best practices by industry and by subject and will recommend one or more of these when appropriate to assist in achieving one or more related goals expert consultation such as that a user should consider retaining a search engine optimization consultant to review ways to improve a blog s search engine performance in preferred embodiments maintains a network of experts and recommends particular experts to users for specific situations and in many cases acts as a middleman or broker between producers and consumers of expert services related to social media brand management campaigns for instance recommending that a user s organization establish a loyalty program adoption campaign using its Facebook fan page in some embodiments will detect campaigns being conducted by identified competitors and will recommend related campaigns to the user to counter the effects of the competitor s campaign and conversion applications for example improving the user experience from landing page to customer conversion in a preferred embodiment provides access to its system to third party solution providers to allow them to offer their solutions to users in which case the system may recommend that certain of such third party conversion applications are used in a given situation . Additional exemplary actions recommended according to a preferred embodiment of the invention comprise 

Examples of third party conversion applications that might be recommended according to the invention comprise a social game that engages fans and promotes virality a newsletter sign up application or a coupon distribution application.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention end user behaviors that is behavior of users of social media such as Twitter Facebook LinkedIn and the like are used advantageously to help determine recommendations to make to client users that is business users who are clients of a service delivered according to the invention . For example as mentioned above if certain Twitter end users are characterized by the fact that they tend to routinely follow back when followed while others may not do so then a recommendation based on a goal of achieve greater reach by gaining more followers might be to follow a certain number of the former end users those who generally follow back and following of those in the second group who tend not to follow back would be ignored. Similarly content recommendations might be made based on a result of analysis that showed for example that certain highly linked individuals that is certain influencers tend to retransmit retweet messages pertaining to certain topics relevant to a business but not to retransmit messages pertaining to other equally relevant topics. In such a situation it would generally be desirable to generate content recommendations that suggest posting content relating to the first group of topics rather than the second group in order to maximize a probability that influential readers upon seeing the newly created content would retransmit at least some of the content and thus create buzz around messages of relevance to a client business.

When recommendations are generated by the system in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention users may elect to adopt decline or defer each recommendation. Default settings may be used and configured by each user or organization so that inactivity is interpreted either as adoption rejection or deferral as desired. According to some embodiments of the invention recommendation adoption decisions are tracked by user organization time and recommendation type and the results are analyzed to determine if there are issues with a given class of recommendations and whether the issues are systemic or whether they affect only a small number of users or organizations . Clearly it will be seen that such analysis is one means for refining recommendation generation as users will be less likely to receive recommendations they do not find useful or relevant after the system has had the opportunity to track the user s response to a large number of previous recommendations of varying types.

According to some embodiments some accepted recommendations are implemented fulfilled automatically. For example if a recommendation is to follow a list of known influencers on Twitter and a user to whom the recommendation is made accepts the recommendation then the system according to the invention will automatically execute the appropriate commands using for example using the Twitter application programming interface API . In some embodiments a scheduler is used either automatically or under user control or based on user configuration to ensure that an automated action is taken at specific times or at specific rates for example it may be desirable to have automatically generated tweets delivered at a steady rate to avoid overloading Twitter or violating API access rules . In other cases user action is required to implement a recommendation as for example when the system recommends that a user increase her frequency of tweeting posting items on Twitter in these cases the system may analyze actions taken and raise alerts if users do not take actions based on one or more recommendations that they explicitly accepted. In some cases the system provides scheduling functions directly to users as for example when according to some embodiments a user is allowed to bulk upload a large number of posts and to schedule them to be posted on her behalf at specified times or at a specified rate.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a system for brand management using social networks comprising an application server social network crawler software modules third party service integration software modules an analytics server a report generator a search engine a behavioral analysis engine a recommendation engine and a database is disclosed. A user registers and provides data pertaining to a brand. Upon retrieving content from a plurality of social networks pertaining to the brand the analytics server module analyzes the content to a content value specific to the brand among members of the social networks. The behavioral analysis engine obtains content elements generated by a first member a social network and analyzes the first member s behavior to compute an audience value of the first member. The report generator prepares reports specific to the brand the reports comprising at least indicia of content value indicia of audience value and recommendations for improving member engagement with the brand.

Because in preferred embodiments actions based on recommendations are tracked by the analysis system and because progress toward achieving user adopted goals is similarly tracked the system normally provides web based user interfaces that allow a user to assess progress toward meeting goals and in implementing specific recommendations in order to allow users to fine tune their activities and possibly to request additional action recommendations to better meet projected targets.

Headings of sections provided in this patent application and the title of this patent application are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.

Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries logical or physical.

A description of an embodiment with several components in communication with each other does not imply that all such components are required. To the contrary a variety of optional components may be described to illustrate a wide variety of possible embodiments of one or more of the inventions and in order to more fully illustrate one or more aspects of the inventions. Similarly although process steps method steps algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order such processes methods and algorithms may generally be configured to work in alternate orders unless specifically stated to the contrary. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be described in this patent application does not in and of itself indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of described processes may be performed in any order practical. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to one or more of the invention s and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred. Also steps are generally described once per embodiment but this does not mean they must occur once or that they may only occur once each time a process method or algorithm is carried out or executed. Some steps may be omitted in some embodiments or some occurrences or some steps may be executed more than once in a given embodiment or occurrence.

When a single device or article is described it will be readily apparent that more than one device or article may be used in place of a single device or article. Similarly where more than one device or article is described it will be readily apparent that a single device or article may be used in place of the more than one device or article.

The functionality or the features of a device may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices that are not explicitly described as having such functionality or features. Thus other embodiments of one or more of the inventions need not include the device itself.

Techniques and mechanisms described or referenced herein will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity.

Many alternative database or data storage system technologies have been and indeed are being introduced in the art including but not limited to distributed non relational data storage systems such as Hadoop column oriented databases in memory databases and the like. While various embodiments may preferentially employ one or another of the various data storage subsystems available in the art or available in the future the invention should not be construed to be so limited as any data storage architecture may be used according to the embodiments. Similarly while in some cases one or more particular data storage needs are described as being satisfied by separate components for example an expanded private capital markets database and a configuration database these descriptions refer to functional uses of data storage systems and do not refer to their physical architecture. For instance any group of data storage systems of databases referred to herein may be included together in a single database management system operating on a single machine or they may be included in a single database management system operating on a cluster of machines as is known in the art. Similarly any single database such as an expanded private capital markets database may be implemented on a single machine on a set of machines using clustering technology on several machines connected by one or more messaging systems known in the art or in a master slave arrangement common in the art. These examples should make clear that no particular architectural approaches to database management is preferred according to the invention and choice of data storage technology is at the discretion of each implementer without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed.

Similarly preferred embodiments of the invention are described in terms of a web based implementation including components such as web servers and web application servers. However such components are merely exemplary of a means for providing services over a large scale public data network such as the Internet and other implementation choices may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance while embodiments described herein deliver their services using web services accessed via one or more webs servers that in turn interact with one or more applications hosted on application servers other approaches such as peer to peer networking direct client server integration using the Internet as a communication means between clients and servers or use of mobile applications interacting over a mobile data network with a one or more dedicated servers are all possible within the scope of the invention.
