The present application is a continuation of U.S. application. Ser. No. 12 332 239 entitled VIDEO PLAYER by Raman et al. filed Dec. 10 2008 the disclosure of the above referenced application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This disclosure relates generally to the playback of video files on a computer system and more particularly to the association of metadata with such video files.

Various embodiments systems methods and tangible computer readable memory media are disclosed relating to a video player configured to play a video file and during playback to access metadata separate from the video file to generate and dynamically display graphical content during playback of the video file. For example an embodiment is disclosed in which a user uploads a video file and associated metadata to a server system e.g. over the Internet . In various embodiments the metadata is stored in a data store e.g. database file etc. separate from the video file. The data store may be located on or accessible to the server system. The server system can subsequently receive a request from a client computer system to play a video corresponding to the video file and in response to the request provide information to the client computer system that causes a video player to play the video file at the client computer system and to access the associated metadata which may in one embodiment include transferring metadata from the data store on the server system to one or more metadata files which may be temporary on the client computer system. The associated metadata may be used in various embodiments to dynamically display graphical content that is distinct from the video. For example the associated metadata may be used by the video player to dynamically display overlay graphics and or navigation graphics. The associated metadata for a video file may be changed e.g. by accessing a website hosting the video file resulting in a different dynamic display of graphic content during subsequent playback of the video file by the video player without having to re encode the video file.

The received metadata may be usable for various other purposes including the overlay of a different audio track indicating video title credits and other graphical elements of the video. The received metadata may indicate items needed to perform a process depicted in an associated video upon playing the video the video player may provide one or more purchase links for these items. The purchase links may be received from for example a creator owner of the video file. In another embodiment locations associated with such links may be determined immediately prior to or during playback of the video file i.e. dynamically . For example a location associated with a link may be dynamically determined by accessing at the time the link is selected a data store at some location to determine the appropriate location to which to link.

In one embodiment a server system stores program instructions executable to receive information indicating editing instructions for a video file e.g. specifying the display of overlay graphics . The server system stores program instructions that are executable to alter the video file based on the received editing instructions such that subsequent playback of the altered video file incorporates the information e.g. displaying overlay graphics and or audio .

In one embodiment received metadata is usable to dynamically display at least two navigation graphics during playback of the video file. These navigation graphics may be user selectable to navigate to a corresponding point in time in the video file. In the context of an instructional video for performing a process having two or more steps for example a navigation graphic may be user selectable to navigate to a portion of the video corresponding to the beginning of the depiction of one of the steps. During the process of uploading metadata about a particular video a server system may provide information usable to display a graphical interface on a client computer system for receiving metadata indicating various user designated points in the video file. Storing this metadata in some data store permits a video player during playback of the video file to access the metadata to dynamically display navigation graphics corresponding to the user designated points in the video file. In the context of an instructional video navigation graphics may identify a step name a step number an image associated with the step which may be selected automatically or by an owner creator of the video etc.

In one embodiment the video player is configured to execute at a client computer system to display navigation graphics in a sidebar display region separate from a display region for the instructional video. In certain embodiments the sidebar display region includes control areas user selectable to control which navigation graphics are currently displayed within the sidebar display region. In certain embodiments the video player is configured to execute at a client computer system to display a timeline indicating a current location within the video. This timeline may be displayed in one embodiment in a display region separate from the display region for the video. In certain embodiments the display region including the timeline may be separate from the sidebar display region if applicable . The displayed timeline may include visual indicia e.g. dots along the timeline that correspond to various points in the video file. In certain embodiments the visual indicia may be user selectable to navigate to the corresponding points in the video file. In some embodiments during a process in which currently specified metadata is edited e.g. through a website hosting the video a user may move one or more of the visual indicia along the timeline thus re designating points in the video file causing navigation graphics if applicable that will be displayed during subsequent playback of the video file to be changed.

 Video player. This term has its ordinary and accepted meaning in the art which includes software that implements a media player for playing a video file that may reside on a volatile or non volatile computer readable memory medium that may in turn be internal e.g. RAM ROM or external e.g. CD DVD Blu ray to a computer system. A FLASH player WINDOWS Media Player and REAL PLAYER are just some examples of video players. A video player may in some embodiments display its output within a window of another application such as a browser running on a client computer system.

 Video file. This term has its ordinary and accepted meaning and the art which includes any file that that represents video. This term includes any type of FLASH video file format FLV H.264 video HE AAC audio including any video embedded within SWF files. There are many examples of other video files including without limitation MPEG files QUICKTIME files AVI files files encoded on media such as DVD Blu ray etc.

 Metadata. This term has its ordinary and accepted meaning in the art. As used herein this term refers to data about a video file including a video file corresponding to an instructional video. For example metadata about an instructional video can include without limitation title description keywords items needed to perform the process depicted in the instructional video purchase links credits e.g. director writer etc. as well as information designating particular points in time during the video e.g. points in time corresponding to the beginning of a step in the depicted process a fact a tip or a warning etc. As described herein in certain embodiments metadata is stored in files distinct from the video file that it describes.

 Data Store. As used herein this term refers to any type of file data structure database or other repository in which data or metadata may be stored.

 Dynamically display. As used herein dynamically displaying something such as graphical content during playback of a video file means that the graphical content changes during playback or is displayed only during a portion of the playback of the video file. Accordingly content that does not change or is not changeable e.g. in response to user input during the entirety of the playback of a video file is not dynamically displayed. Examples of content distinct from the display of the video file that may be displayed dynamically include overlay graphics and navigation graphics.

 Graphical content. As used herein this term refers to visual content and may include without limitation text images etc. Graphical content may have an associated audio component e.g. an icon or other indicia associated with an audio file but does not refer to audio only content.

 Usable by. In the context of file X is usable by software Y to do Z this phrase refers to a situation in which software Y is configured to perform function Z when executed on a computer system in response to receiving input data of a certain format and connotes that file X has data of a certain format that software Y is configured to use operate on to perform function Z. Thus if a video player is configured to display overlay graphics during playback of a video file in response to a value in a metadata file indicating that such graphics are to be displayed it can be said that the metadata file is usable by the video player to determine whether the graphics are to be displayed. In contrast a file encoding only audio is not usable in this fashion.

 Purchase link. Some indicia e.g. a hyperlink or icon that is user selectable to navigate to a location e.g. a web page where some item associated with the link can be purchased. For example consider an instructional video for performing a process that requires duct tape and ball bearings. Purchase links for these items might include a uniform resource locator URL linking a web page that permits a user to purchase one or both of these items. In one embodiment a purchase link may correspond to an executable or program instruction that facilitates the purchase of an item from some location while in another embodiment a purchase link may simply be a hypertext link or other type of link.

 Overlay graphic. As used herein this term refers to graphical content image text advertisement etc. that is displayed on top of the video file overlaid at some designated point in the video file. Consider an instructional video for performing a process having three steps that begin at 0 14 m ss 1 23 and 3 00 into the video respectively. Graphical content denoting the beginning of one of these steps and that is displayed by the video player on top of the video file but which is not itself part of the video file is an overlay graphic. An overlay graphic can also be used to denote a fact tip warning or other text that is to be displayed during the video.

 Navigation graphic. As used herein this term refers to graphical content that is user selectable to navigate to some predetermined point in a corresponding video file. Consider a video player which is configured to play a video file as well as distinct graphical content that corresponds to one or more points in the video. In this example the graphical content corresponding to each of these one or more points is a navigation graphic if it is user selectable to navigate to some corresponding point in the video. Note that traditional user selectable controls such as play fast forward next chapter track rewind previous chapter track pause skip etc. are not navigation graphics under the above definition as they do not have a corresponding video file and they are thus not associated with a predetermined point in such a file.

 Navigate. As used herein this term refers to moving within a particular video file. This term is broad enough to refer to for example fast forwarding a video file as well as moving to a predetermined point in a video file by selecting a navigation graphic.

 User selectable. As used herein this phrase refers to some aspect of a graphical interface e.g. of a video player that can be selected e.g. by clicking or mousing over etc. by a user via some means a pointing device touch screen etc. . For example in some embodiments a navigation graphic may be selectable by a user to navigate to a particular point in an instructional video. In contrast an aspect of an interface that cannot be designated by a user e.g. a static logo in some embodiments is not user selectable.

 Sidebar display region. As used herein this phrase refers to a display region in which a video player can display graphical content. In some embodiments this region is distinct from a display region in which a video file is displayed.

 Scrolling. This term has its ordinary and accepted meaning in the art which includes moving through a list of items e.g. navigation graphics by selecting some user selectable visual indicia e.g. a scroll bar .

 Timeline. As used herein a visual representation which may be separate from a display region for displaying a video file in some embodiments of the progress of a currently selected video file. In some embodiments a timeline may include visual indicia corresponding to one or more points within the video file.

 Visual Indicia. Some visual representation of something else. For example in a timeline displayed by a video player may include dots visual indicia representing user designated points in time in a video file.

 Configured. As used herein this term means that a particular piece of hardware or software is arranged to perform a particular task or tasks when operated. Thus a computer system that is configured to perform task A means that the computer system includes a circuit program instructions stored in memory or other structure that during operation of the computer system performs or can be used to perform task A. As such a computer system can be configured to perform task A even if the computer system is not currently on.

Illustrative web pages facilitating method are described below with reference to . Method is described below as a series of actions performed by server system in response to information received from client computer system . Corresponding client side methods are also contemplated having similar steps e.g. instead of receive information identifying user in step convey information identifying user to server system or input information identifying user to client computer system for conveyance to server system .

In step server system receives information identifying a user. Certain embodiments of method may not include step . In one embodiment server system includes data and program instructions executable to implement a website that stores account information for users of the website. Accordingly receipt of user identifying information in step may facilitate the retrieval of certain preferences for the identified user that may facilitate subsequent data entry. The user identifying information in step may include a user identification value e.g. userid and password in one embodiment. In certain embodiments the user identifying information may be received via a file such as a cookie stored on client computer system . In general step may be practiced by any known means of user identification including biometrics access token etc. The information received in step may in some embodiments identify a group account associated with multiple users.

In step server system receives metadata relating to a particular video file. The received metadata is not limited in any way and can be any information relating to the particular video file. For example the received metadata can include information indicating a title of the video file short description keywords to facilitate a search for the video etc. A particular set of metadata for an instructional video is described further below in the context of . In one embodiment metadata received in step is stored in a database or file or other repository e.g. metadata on or accessible to server system .

In step server system receives the video file corresponding to the metadata received in step . Video file may be in any suitable type of video format. Step may be performed for example using known techniques for uploading files via a website. In various embodiments step may be performed in a different order than shown in for example in some embodiments step may be performed prior to step . Alternately step can be performed concurrently with the receipt of other metadata e.g. in step . A screenshot illustrating a particular implementation of step is described further below in the context of .

In step server system receives additional metadata relating to the video file that has been uploaded. In some embodiments all metadata relating to the video file may be received in step thus step may not be present in those embodiments. Although step is not limited in the type of metadata that may be received this step is particularly suited for receiving metadata of a type that is facilitated by server system already having a copy of the video file. As one example the metadata received in step may include metadata specifying one or more points in the video file. In such an embodiment server system can provide a web page to client computer system that permits the user to playback the uploaded video file as well as make selections during playback that mark one or more points in the video file. For example step might include in one embodiment a video player that plays the uploaded video file on client computer system along with a control button or other indicia that a user can select at any point during playback. In one variation of such an embodiment when a particular point in time is selected a user can input further information about the selected point in time e.g. a description thereof .

As will be discussed below such an embodiment is usable in the context of an instructional video file to mark various points in the video file and supply information about those points. For example such points might correspond to the beginning of steps in the video as well as other points in time corresponding to facts tips warnings or other information. This embodiment might also permit the inputting of further information about these points in time e.g. text images etc. .

Step may also include the selection of a representative image for the video file as a whole or for various portions of the video e.g. steps chapters etc. . In one embodiment server system automatically chooses default representative images and permits a user to override these selections if desired. In another embodiment server system receives a user specified selection of a representative image. A screenshot illustrating a particular implementation of step is described further below in the context of . As with step metadata received in step may be stored in a database or file or other repository on or accessible to server system e.g. metadata .

Note that points in a video file may be identified without playing back the video file and allowing a user to mark one or more points during playback. In one embodiment for example server system might receive a series of values e.g. from a file on client computer system that identifies a series of points to mark during a particular video along with corresponding descriptive information e.g. 0 05 Step 1 0 30 Step 2 etc. .

In step server system receives distribution information relating to the uploaded video file. Certain embodiments of method may not include this step. Distribution information specifies information for sharing the uploaded video file. For example distribution information may include one or more addresses e.g. email addresses telephone numbers etc. . Upon receiving this distribution information server system in one embodiment is configured to send a message e.g. an email message text message etc. to the one or more specified addresses. These messages may include a link to the video code executable to play the video within the message itself etc. Distribution information in some embodiments can specify one or more locations e.g. websites at which a link to the uploaded video is to be posted. Such information allows a user to link the uploaded video at a home page a social networking site Internet portal any designated web page on any website etc. A screenshot illustrating a particular implementation of step is described further below in the context of .

Turning now to a flowchart of a method is shown. Method is one embodiment of a method for editing metadata e.g. metadata entered via method . As with method method is written from the perspective of a server system a corresponding client side method is also contemplated.

In step server system receives information identifying a user. Step may be similar to embodiments described above for step in method . In step server system receives information e.g. from client computer system identifying a video file whose metadata is to be edited. For example in step server system might receive information identifying an instructional video entitled How to Change a Flat Tire. This step allows for example system to retrieve the currently stored metadata for the indicated video file which may be stored in a data store database file etc. which may then be conveyed to system for display. Next in step server system receives updated metadata e.g. from system for the video file identified in step . For example if method is performed subsequent to method an updated version of any type of metadata received in steps and may be received in step . Finally in step the updated metadata is saved by server system e.g. updating the relevant database file etc. .

In embodiments in which metadata is stored on server system in one or more metadata files that are separate from the associated video file method permits updated metadata to be supplied to server system independent of the video file. In embodiments in which metadata is usable by a video player to dynamically display graphical content during playback of a video file method permits a different visual display of a given video file without having to re encode and re upload the video file.

Turning now to a screenshot of a website implementing one embodiment of method is depicted. As shown screenshot depicts a web page having a graphical user interface having a number of different portions. In this particular embodiment screenshot depicts a web page for uploading an instructional video and associated metadata. Numerous variations of the web page depicted in screenshot are possible.

Portion includes the text Hello nimprojects illustrating that a particular user nimprojects has been identified to the server system corresponding to the website step . Portion is a progress indicator indicating that this web page represents step one of a four step upload process. Portions and permit a user to identify respectively a particular video file a title a description and a category of the instructional video file to be uploaded. Note that the title of the video file identified in portion can be different from the title input in portion . The category of a video file permits in one embodiment a user to associate the video with one of a number of pre established categories. Similarly portion permits a user to specify tags that will aid in locating the video file via a search engine or other methods. Portion allows a user to specify certain attributes of the video file including whether the video file is public or private i.e. available to all users or only selected users as well as whether the video file includes mature content. Portion is selectable to proceed to a second step of the upload process. Screenshot thus illustrates a web page implementing one possible embodiment of step of method .

Turning now to a screenshot of a web page is shown illustrating the second step of the upload process described above with reference to see portion of the displayed graphical user interface in which 2. Items and Credits is highlighted . This web page indicates that the instructional video file has been identified wildstyle.mov . Additionally portion permits a user to input a list of items that are needed for performing the process depicted in this instructional video. In certain embodiments the user can also input additional information such as the amount of the item that is needed measurements of the item whether the item is optional etc. For example in a cooking instructional video the You Will Need input portion allows a user to input a list of ingredients.

Turning now to a block diagram of a video player is depicted. Video player is one embodiment of a video player program corresponding to video player code described above. Numerous other embodiments of a video player are also possible according to the present disclosure. As shown video player includes video playback engine control engine metadata processor sidebar engine control bar engine enhanced video engine advertising control and captioning control . Each of these blocks corresponds to functionality that may be implemented by one or more modules in various embodiments.

Video playback engine in one embodiment is code that is configured to access a given video file represented by video file in for playback. Engine may be a FLASH player in one embodiment. In one particular implementation engine outputs the video to video display region a particular region of the output of video player one embodiment of which is illustrated below with reference to in one operating mode. In some embodiments video player operates in a mode in which it can be controlled via an application programming interface API . This allows third party software for example to use video player engine as well as other functionality of player by making accesses via API . In such a mode video player engine directs its output to the third party software via control engine and API illustrated by the line connecting the output of video playback engine to control engine . In some embodiments engine is configured to playback numerous types of video files. Video playback engine can be controlled for example by control bar engine for example in response to user input pausing or playing video file . Such control may be via control engine in certain embodiments. 

Control engine in one embodiment is code within video player that coordinates the functionality of the various other modules depicted in . For example control engine may invoke the various modules engines that make up the interface for player and control interaction between modules e.g. between video playback engine and metadata processor . Additionally in some embodiments control engine determines the current mode of the player e.g. standard control or API based control etc.

Metadata processor in one embodiment is code within video player that accesses metadata represented by metadata depicted in that has been associated with video file being played back. In one embodiment metadata is a data store database file or other repository on server system e.g. metadata in which the metadata for file was originally saved. In one embodiment metadata is a database file or other repository on a client computer system e.g. system . For example metadata could be a temporary file e.g. in XML or other extensible language that is dynamically created by metadata processor by transferring data stored on server system e.g. metadata to a client computer system e.g. system . Metadata is thus representative of metadata for video file wherever the metadata is stored.

As has been described above the metadata for a particular video may include a wide variety of information including various time markings within the video whether overlay graphics are to be used etc. Metadata processor accesses the metadata during operation of video player as mentioned above in one embodiment processor controls the download streaming etc. of metadata which may include copyright protection e.g. to client computer system that has selected video file for playback and provides this information to various modules within player as needed. For example metadata processor may access information about time markings within metadata to generate navigation graphics for a particular video. These navigation graphics may be stored in random access memory where they are available to sidebar engine to be displayed as needed. In some embodiments sidebar engine may actually generate the navigation graphics rather than processor . 

Sidebar engine in one embodiment is code within video player that controls the operation of sidebar display region which is a display region output by player this region may be distinct from video display region in one embodiment . As will be shown below with reference to sidebar display region may be toggled to be visible or not at any given point in time.

Sidebar engine can then display these graphics within sidebar display region in some embodiments. In certain implementations of sidebar engine one or more controls are usable to facilitate scrolling within display region this feature is illustrated below with reference to .

Sidebar engine in one embodiment also receives any user input within display region . Such input may alter what type of content is currently being displayed within region as well as within region . For example if a user selects a particular navigation graphic sidebar engine passes information indicating this selection to control engine which in turn causes video playback engine to begin playing from the point in time during video file corresponding to the selected navigation graphic.

Control bar engine in one embodiment is code within video player that controls the operation of control bar display region which is a display region output by player this region may be distinct from video display region and sidebar display region in various embodiments . Control bar display region will be described further below with reference to and in various embodiments may include a timeline which may or may not have selectable visual indicia corresponding to marked points within video file as well as controls to stop play pause fast forward and rewind a video file. Additionally region may include volume controls sharing controls zoom controls slow motion controls screen size controls etc. In certain embodiments control bar engine is responsible for both the display of region as well as receipt of input received through this region. Like sidebar display region control bar display region may provide information to control video playback engine e.g. upon a user selecting a particular location along a displayed timeline .

Enhanced video engine is code that controls the display of overlay graphics which may include in one embodiment a title card step delineation graphics and overlays for facts tips warnings etc. Other types of overlay graphics may also be used in other embodiments. As has been described metadata in one embodiment includes information indicating which if any overlay graphics are to be used in playing back video file as well as corresponding times at which these graphics are to be displayed. In certain embodiments information in metadata may also indicate that custom overlay graphics are to be used. In one embodiment metadata processor communicates this information to enhanced video engine which is configured to overlay any indicated graphics on top of the video output of video playback engine .

In one embodiment video engine further includes audio functionality and is configured to support the overlay of audio on top of or in place of any audio for video file .

Advertising control module in one embodiment is code that controls the display of advertising within one or more display regions output by video player . In one embodiment advertising control module receives information from metadata processor indicating certain keywords or a description of video file . This information permits module in one embodiment to select appropriate advertisements to be dynamically or statically displayed within video player . In other embodiments module may select advertisements using criteria not based on information included within metadata . In certain embodiments control module may be a third party software module. Similarly advertisements selected by module may be from a third party site or database.

The timeline in region includes dots within the timeline one example of visual indicia that correspond in one embodiment to points in the video file that have been marked by the user in metadata files . Control bar region allows a user to select any of these dots in order to navigate to that point in the video file. In certain embodiments passing the cursor over the displayed dots e.g. mousing over causes textual information associated with the marked point in time to be displayed e.g. in a text balloon. For example mousing over a dot within the timeline of region might display the text of a tip or the name of a step in the video.

In one embodiment control allows a user to advance forward and backward between the points in time corresponding to the visual indicia shown in the timeline in region . For example control may allow a user to advance from the middle of step 1 to the beginning of step 2 in the context of an instructional video. Similarly display region in one embodiment outputs text corresponding to the current point in time in the video file. For example in display region includes an expanded version of the tip text displayed in region . In other embodiments display region could display data determined during video playback such data might be different during each playback of a given video file .

Turning now to a screenshot of output from one embodiment of a video player according to the present disclosure is depicted. Screenshot shows sidebar display region which was hidden in . Note that control not labeled in reads Hide rather than Show .

In the embodiment shown region includes three areas You Will Need needed items area Easy Steps steps area and related videos area . These three areas are particularly suited for display in conjunction with an instructional video. In other embodiments the contents of sidebar display region may be different.

In the embodiment shown needed items area lists one or more items used for performing the process depicted by video file . In one embodiment this list of items resides in metadata and is accessed by metadata processor . Accordingly the metadata corresponding to the needed items may be changed by the owner of the video file as desired. In certain embodiments area includes purchase links for one or more of the listed items. Variations of purchase links are described further with reference to .

In one embodiment the list of needed items may dynamically change during playback of the video file for example the list of needed items may correspond to the currently active step . In such an embodiment metadata processor accesses metadata to retrieve the current data to be displayed in area .

In the embodiment shown steps area includes one or more navigation graphics each of which is user selectable to navigate to a particular point in time in the video. In the context of an instructional video navigation graphics may correspond to steps in the depicted process as well as other points in time at which it is appropriate to call the viewer s attention to particular subject matter e.g. facts tips warnings etc. . In certain embodiments the set of currently displayed navigations graphics changes during video playback. For example in one embodiment the current step etc. is displayed in the middle of area . Note In the embodiment shown area expands when active. Area is not active in . In some embodiments area includes a user selectable control e.g. up and down arrows to allow scrolling within steps independent of the current state of playback of video file . In certain embodiments navigation graphics in area include graphics and text relating to the portion of the video with which they are associated. Area is also discussed with reference to . Navigation graphics are of course possible in types of videos other than instructional videos.

Related videos area when active displays graphics e.g. thumbnails corresponding to videos that are deemed to be related to the current video based on some predetermined criteria. For example videos having representative graphics in area might be classified in the same category as the current video. Alternately videos depicted in area might share certain keywords with the current video. Area is also discussed with reference to .

Turning now to a screenshot is shown that depicts a video player having a sidebar display region . As shown region shown in screenshot includes needed items area steps area and related videos these areas are not labeled in for convenience . Area is currently expanded and displays a list of six needed items. Two of these items are highlighted and have shopping cart icons next to them. These icons are purchase links and are user selectable in various embodiments to facilitate the purchase lease temporary use etc. of the associated item via some location e.g. a web page .

In one embodiment a purchase link may simply be a hyperlink that causes a different page e.g. web page of electronic content to be displayed to the user. In other embodiments a purchase link may cause an executable to run to facilitate a purchase. Various embodiments of purchase links are thus possible.

In one embodiment the purchase link facilitates purchase of the associated item at a location e.g. a web page that is stored in metadata . Accordingly a video owner creator might supply a link to a website where a particular item may be purchased. In another embodiment the location associated with a particular purchase link may be determined dynamically. As one example sidebar engine might access a third party site to determine during or before playback an appropriate location to associate with a particular purchase link for a particular item. The appropriate location in some instances might correspond to a third party that has placed the highest current bid for the right to display that link. In such embodiments the same purchase link icon might point to different locations at different points in time.

Turning now to two different screenshots and of steps area within sidebar display region of video player are shown. The steps area in each Figure includes a number of navigation graphics each of which corresponds to a particular point in time in the associated video file. Some of the navigation graphics shown in include only text while some include text an image and a time value indicating its relative location within the video file. Also note that area includes a scroll bar permitting traversal of all points in time identified in metadata . In the embodiment shown each of the navigation graphics depicted can be selected by the user in order to immediately skip to that point in the video. In other embodiments steps area can include non selectable content or content that has other functionality.

Turning now to a screenshot is depicted in which the Related Videos tab is active. This feature allows a user to be exposed to videos that he or she may be interested in based on the current video user preferences etc. This information may be dynamically determined by sidebar engine during playback in some embodiments.

Turning now to screenshots and are shown of video player upon completion of playback of video file . Screenshot in depicts the selection of the Related Videos tab while screenshot in depicts the selection of the Share this Video tab . Tab permits a user to post a link to or embed the video in various websites and or send a link to a user at a specified address such as an email address.

Turning now to a screenshot illustrating the use of a title card overlay graphic is shown. As has been described above in one embodiment the metadata upload editing processes e.g. methods permit a user to specify whether overlay graphics are to be used during playback of the video file. Such overlay graphics are advantageous because they permit the creator owner of a video to have them appear with a minimum of effort on their part.

Consider the example shown in . In this embodiment all a user needs to do to have this title card appear is to specify that title overlay graphics are desired and to provide the desired video title to be included in the title overlay graphic. In one embodiment during playback enhanced video engine determines from metadata processor that title overlay graphics have been selected and that a certain title has been supplied. In one embodiment engine combines the supplied title with a default graphic such as the chevron symbol shown in to produce an overlay graphic. In one particular implementation the overlay graphic may be accompanied by some predetermined audio clip that is overlaid e.g. a chime sound . As has been described in some embodiments a video owner may opt to supply not only the text for an overlay graphic but the actual graphic itself. The use of such custom graphics may be handled by engine in one embodiment.

Turning now to screenshots and illustrating different types of overlay graphics are shown. illustrates an overlay graphic that delineates the start of a step in an instructional video while illustrate overlay graphics and corresponding to a tip and a fact respectively. In some embodiments overlay graphics are used to depict a warning regarding a particular process. Note that tip fact and warning are merely exemplary kinds of content and overlay graphics are possible to represent a wide variety of content types.

In one embodiment an underlying video file may be edited so that it includes overlay graphics and or audio. In one implementation this process may be initiated for example when metadata for a particular video file is received initially e.g. method or when it is updated e.g. method . First a video owner creator may specify e.g. to server system that the video file is to be altered to include overlay graphics and or audio. This specification may include the graphic s to be used the placement of graphics on the screen the time in the video file at which the graphics are to be overlaid any associated audio etc. With the video file to be edited already uploaded this process may next include deconstructing the first portion of the video file to be altered into individual frames video is commonly shot at a rate such as 24 frames second . This deconstruction may be performed using known means such as rotoscoping. Next each frame in the first portion of the video file may be manipulated to include the desired graphical content. This manipulation may be done automatically e.g. by server system based on user specifications or manually e.g. within the context of a browser on system using an editing tool software including program instructions executable by system provided by server system that has the ability to add graphics to individual frames of video . When editing of the frames in the first portion of video is complete any remaining portions of the video file to be altered are edited in the same fashion. Finally the altered frames are reassembled to create an altered video file. The alteration of a video file in this manner allows such a video file to be played on an arbitrary player or device yet have a similar appearance as if played on a video player with an enhanced video engine e.g. configured to display overlay graphics specified through metadata. Audio may be overlaid on the relevant portions of the video file as well.

Similarly an overlay animation could be edited into a video file by deconstructing the desired animation into a set of frames and then aligning those frames on top of the set of video frames to be altered.
