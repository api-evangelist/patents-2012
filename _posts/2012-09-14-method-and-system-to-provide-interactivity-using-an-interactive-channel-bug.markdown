This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 841 018 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM TO PROVIDE INTERACTIVITY USING AN INTERACTIVE CHANNEL BUG filed Apr. 23 2001 which is related to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60 199 686 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR TRANSFORMING CONTENT FOR EXECUTION ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS filed on Apr. 24 2000 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to interactive television. More particularly the present invention relates to a method and system to provide interactivity using an interactive channel bug.

As interactive television iTV systems evolve to the point of offering more complex and varied services e.g. home shopping interactive games home banking and other financial transactions etc. iTV systems tend to be complicated for users to operate the television as an interface to such services. That is it is difficult for users to navigate through the iTV system while watching current programming content.

Past iTV systems have been limited in scope. For example the most basic interactivity provided by iTV systems used teletext where cyclical digital data is inserted in the vertical blanking interval of a video signal. The net result is typically a few lines of text at the base of a television screen. Users may then use a remote control device to select television images gain access to the Internet and the like from the teletext. A disadvantage of using teletext is that it is often distracting to users to see lines of text at the base of the television screen while watching a program.

Another common iTV system involves tuning to a dedicated channel associated with interactive services. A disadvantage of such a system is that users need to tune to the specific channel and often interrupt a scheduled program to gain access to the interactive services.

Thus what is needed is an unobtrusive iTV system to facilitate simple interactivity for a user of the iTV system.

A method and system are disclosed to provide interactivity using an interactive channel bug. The interactive channel bug can be used to indicate or to launch interactivity. In one embodiment the interactive channel bug is a graphical object which includes an interactive broadcast channel branding logo that facilitates interactivity for television users. The interactive channel bug may facilitate interactivity for a user which may use remote control commands to access the interactive channel bug. In one embodiment any conventional channel bug e.g. NBC s peacock CBS s eye etc. may be made interactive by replacing the standard channel bug with interactive broadcast content.

In one embodiment the interactive channel bug allows television users to initiate interactivity. For example the channel bug may have an associated action that launches some functionality determined by the broadcaster. This functionality however may change over time. That is through the use of broadcast enhancements the form of the channel bug can change. This allows for the broadcaster to signal to users that new interactivity is now available.

The interactive channel bug may have multiple types of forms. In one implementation for example the interactive channel bug may be the standard channel bug that appears when no additional interactivity is available. The interactive channel bug can launch a rollout menu of standard services such as news weather and sports related to the broadcasted content. Another channel bug form may be an animated channel bug that indicates additional interactivity associated with the current broadcast. Yet another form may be a channel bug including an image that indicates a purchase opportunity. The types of channel bugs described herein can be used to support broadcast advertising partners and to launch product purchases and or product information services.

TV system includes a television receiver and a set top box . Set top box can also be embedded hardware within television system includes a screen to display an audio video interactive signal through television receiver tuner which can pass through set top box or hardware internal to television system that will decode broadcast signals and separate interactive content or components. Television system may also contain a tuner not shown and other standard components of television systems. A remote control or other standard input devices such as a keyboard may be used to provide inputs to television system or set top box . The remote control device may be coupled to an input port of set top box such as by a hard wired connection or by way of a wireless infrared IR or radio frequency RF link.

Set top box may be connected to Internet in a standard manner. Set top box or embedded decoding hardware within television system can receive a television signal from a terrestrial source satellite source or a cable source or other like sources. In one embodiment a user of television system may use an input device e.g. a trackball a force activated pointing device a conventional joystick etc. to access a channel bug associated with a television program to launch interactive services in a manner that will be described in more detail below.

Referring to set top box includes a central processing unit CPU coupled to memory devices which include a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM . Any number of memory devices may be included in set top box . For example a memory device may be a logical memory device to include a broadcast file system. A broadcast file system is a carousel of data flowing through a broadcast stream. In one embodiment set top box may read data from that stream by waiting for appropriate data to pass by. CPU can be coupled to a number of input output I 0 devices via I O interfaces and . CPU is also coupled to decoder .

CPU controls the basic operation for set top box . For example CPU can process inputs from a user. CPU can process instructions stored in RAM or ROM based on the inputs from the user. Alternatively CPU can process instructions that are contained within a broadcast stream and are decoded by set top box or hardware embedded in TV system . In one embodiment a bug and its morph instruction and content may be received within a broadcast stream. The bug can be used to launch interactivity. Additionally the interactivity that may be launched can come from a broadcast stream or from a back channel e.g. an Internet Protocol IP pathway.

Decoder is a processing device that processes television signal . In one embodiment decoder can decode a channel bug inserted into television signal . Decoder can inform CPU of the inserted channel bug. Decoder may inform set top box or embedded hardware to obtain a channel bug from a back channel and render it onto the display for television system . Decoder may also inform set top box or embedded hardware in television system to obtain a bug from the broadcast file system and render it on the display for television system . Decoder may also inform such systems to render a channel bug that has already received. The same is true for morphing the interactive channel bug.

Furthermore set top box or embedded hardware within television system can decode instructions from a broadcast stream to change an interactive channel bug within a broadcast stream. In one embodiment an interactive channel bug can be pulled from a logical drive such as the broadcast file system a back channel or may be implemented from assets already resident in a set top box type receiver. The same can be applied to launching interactivity. Any number of sources can provide the interactive channel bug and interactive services.

Thus CPU or decoder can perform instructions facilitated by a user accessing a channel bug. In one embodiment CPU or decoder can process executable code which may include programming code in JAVA C Perl HMTL or other like programming code in determining at what point to morph an interactive channel bug or even the broadcast bug. Such instructions for morphing may come through the broadcast stream over an IP pathway or may be triggered by set top box where there is some resident code that has been initiated to trigger a signal for morphing. The instructions can also be used to make the interactive channel bug appear on television system and provide interactive services.

ROM or RAM may include instructions and data for execution by CPU . RAM may also be used to store program variables for programming instructions which may be contained in ROM or other types of memory. I O interfaces and may include a remote control input port a network interface a video audio output port and a television signal input port or other like interfaces. In one embodiment 1 0 interface or is a network interface that connects to a private or public network such as Internet .

At operation a broadcast is transmitted. For example a broadcast station may transmit a broadcast to set top box or embedded TV device hardware .

At operation the broadcast is received by set top box . Set top box processes and decodes the received broadcast into a broadcast stream.

At operation set top box delivers the broadcast stream to receiver in television system . In one embodiment set top box or TV embedded hardware decodes the broadcast stream and separates the channel bug or interactivity from the broadcast stream.

At operation an interactive service is launched based on an embedded channel bug in the broadcast stream. Alternatively the broadcast stream may have a trigger say to create or morph an interactive channel bug. Television system may then retrieve and render the channel bug. Furthermore the channel bug can be retrieved from a number of sources such as for example resident memory broadcast file system or some remote device via an IP pathway.

In one embodiment the channel bug is a graphical object which may include a broadcast channel branding logo or any other type of logo. The channel bug or channel bug trigger may be embedded in the broadcast stream according to numerous known technologies such as ATVEF. The channel bug may also be rendered using various methods including rendering of ATVEF compliant data. The channel bug may also be retrieved using various methods such as for example a broadcast file system resident memory or remote device via an IP pathway.

In one embodiment a user can access the channel bug by using a remote control device to manipulate a pointer on television system so that the user can click on the channel bug to launch interactive services. In one embodiment the interactive services is related to the broadcast being displayed. For example if the broadcast being displayed is related to e.g. news weather or sports a user can access the channel bug being provided with the broadcast which may provide further services related to the broadcast. That is if the broadcast is weather related a user can access the channel bug to obtain weather related news for another state. In one embodiment the channel bug is not related to broadcast content but provides general information about the broadcaster such as for example what is on later indicate message or email indicate specials etc.

In one embodiment accessing the channel bug provides a rollout menu that may include hyperlinks to other information e.g. image maps etc. for a user to select and access via the Internet. Of course the remote control device could be any one of numerous control devices including a wireless keyboard a wireless pointer device etc. It is also possible not to use a remote control device at all and to use just a keypad cursor etc. attached directly to the television system.

At operation a broadcast is transmitted. For example a broadcast station may transmit a news related broadcast to set top box .

At operation the news related broadcast is received by set top box . Set top box processes decodes and separates the received broadcast into a broadcast stream with interactivity. The interactivity may also flow through an independent pathway to the set top box such as an IP pathway. In one embodiment set top box processes a channel bug inserted into the news related broadcast.

At operation the channel bug is morphed. For example set top box executes code in the news related broadcast stream. In one embodiment a trigger can come through an IP pathway such as direct IP or through a multicast to trigger the channel bug. The trigger can instruct the channel bug to be displayed or to morph the channel bug based on information embedded in the news related broadcast.

At operation set top box delivers the broadcast stream with the morphed channel bug to television system . The morphed channel bug may appear on television system in a number of ways.

For example the channel bug may change form start flashing and etc. to indicate to a user that interactivity is associated with channel bug for the news broadcast. In particular the broadcaster for the news broadcast may use the channel bug to facilitate an on line poll related to news broadcast. That is instead of having to make a phone call or separate access the Internet providers of the news broadcast can use the channel bug to conduct the on line poll.

At operation if a user accesses the channel bug interactive services are launched. For example by clicking on the channel bug a user can access an on line poll related to news items. The broadcaster can ask the user to vote for a candidate in a story covering local or national politics. Using the television screen as the interface the user could vote for their candidate of choice. In another example user viewer of a game show such as Jeopardy can play along with contestants in which the channel bug is used as the launching point for the interactivity.

At operation a broadcast is transmitted. For example a broadcast station may transmit an advertisement commercial as a broadcast to set top box . The broadcaster may allow the advertiser to use the broadcaster s bug or allow the advertiser to replace the broadcaster s bug with the advertiser s bug to indicate interactivity associated with a commercial.

At operation the advertisement related broadcast is received by set top box . Set top box processes and decodes the received broadcast into a broadcast stream. In one embodiment set top box processes a channel bug inserted into the advertisement related broadcast.

At operation the channel bug is morphed. For example set top box executes code in the news related broadcast stream to morph the channel bug based on information embedded in the advertisement related broadcast. Furthermore the code can be pulled through an IP pathway or pulled from a broadcast file system. The code or instructions for morphing a channel bus is not limited to any particular source.

At operation set top box delivers the advertisement related broadcast with the morphed channel bug to television system . The morphed channel bug can alert a user viewer to purchase opportunities available through television system . Such a feature can be useful to broadcast advertising partners by allowing the channel bug to morph during an advertisement for a particular product service. This allows a user viewer to purchase a product service or to obtain additional information regarding the product service almost immediately which is facilitated by the channel bug.

At operation if the user accesses the channel bug interactive services are launched. For example by clicking on the channel bug the user can gain access to e.g. a merchant s web site or to access local content in a resident in memory or content in a broadcast file system. Thus the user would be able to purchase a desired product service electronically over the Internet. It should be appreciated of course that a variety of purchase transaction models may be used with the present invention. In yet another embodiment the network operator providing the broadcast may choose to replace the channel bug or to add a network specific channel bug. The network operator e.g. a cable system operator can replace broadcasters bug with their own bug.

Referring now to there is shown a sample screen display produced if an interactive broadcast channel branding logo channel bug activates a rollout menu of services . By using e.g. a remote control device that can be to a set top box a user can select channel bug causing the rollout menu of services to appear. As described above a user may select various menu items which may include news weather sports hyperlinks to a web site etc. . These items provide a user with a variety of interactive services in a manner well known in the art of interactive television systems.

The techniques described herein may be integrated into advanced Internet or network based knowledge systems as related to information retrieval information extraction and question and answer systems. is an example of one embodiment of a computer system. The system has a processor coupled to a bus . Also shown coupled to the bus is a memory which may contain executing code and graphical assets to morph the channel bug according to a signal embedded in a broadcast stream. Additional components shown coupled to the bus are a storage device such as a hard drive floppy drive CD ROM DVD ROM etc. an input device such as a keyboard mouse light pen barcode reader scanner microphone joystick etc. and an output device such as a printer monitor speakers etc. . Of course an exemplary computer system could have more components than these or a subset of the components listed.

The techniques described herein may also use a memory of a computer system i.e. a set top box to store a set of instructions to be executed. In addition the instructions to perform the techniques described herein may alternatively be stored on other forms of machine readable media including magnetic and optical disks. For example the system and method of the present invention may be stored on machine readable media such as magnetic disks or optical disks which are accessible via a disk drive or computer readable medium drive . Further the instructions may be downloaded into a computing device over a data network in the form of a compiled and linked version and or set of graphical assets.

Alternatively the logic to perform the techniques described herein may be implemented in additional computer and or machine readable media such as discrete hardware components as large scale integrated circuits LSD s application specific integrated circuits ASIC s firmware such as electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM s and electrical optical acoustical and other forms of propagated signals e.g. carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. .

At operation a video stream is captured and analyzed to locate a broadcast bug. For example as shown in a TV broadcast is captured and analyzed to locate broadcast bug which is represented by a circle. 

At operation an X Y position of the broadcast bug is determined. For example as shown in the X Y position represented by dashed lines is determined around broadcast bug .

At operation an interactive bug is aligned over the broadcast bug. For example as shown in interactive bug represented by the symbol X is aligned over broadcast bug . The screen shown in can be displayed to a user.

At operation a user can interact with the interactive bug within the broadcast. For example as shown in a user can access interactive bug that launches or triggers display of content . The use can thus interact with content .

Interactive system includes a TV having a TV display with a bug . In one embodiment bug is displayed based on a trigger passing through a TV broadcast via broadcaster or over an IP pathway via content server . Content for bug may be embedded in the TV broadcast or may be resident in a memory within set top box or may come from the IP pathway. In one embodiment bug is rendered on TV display . For example set top box can be configured with code or instructions to process the trigger to render bug .

In another embodiment bug is morphed which can also be based on a trigger passing through a TV broadcast via broadcaster or over an IP pathway via content server . Content for a morphed bug may be embedded in the TV broadcast or may be resident in a memory within set top box or may come from the IP pathway.

Bug can be used to launch interactivity. For example a user can click on bug . If bug is clicked the an interactive application is launched. The interactive application can be launched from resident code within set top box or an application found in a logical memory store such as a broadcast file system or from a remote content server such as content server or content server . Bug may also be an application in an of itself e.g. a roll out menu. Bug may also send a signal to another device to indicate a buy or a vote or request for additional information. Here bug may not launch any new interactivity and only cause some event to occur when the bug is clicked.

Thus an interactive broadcast channel branding logo that provides interactivity for television viewers has been described. In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will however be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.
