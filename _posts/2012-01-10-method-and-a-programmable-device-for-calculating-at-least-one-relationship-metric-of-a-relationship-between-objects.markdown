title: Method and a programmable device for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects
abstract: A method for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects has the steps of providing a multi-layered relationship network with a first relationship layer derived from potential relations between objects, a second relationship layer derived from interactions between objects, a third relationship layer derived from explicit relations between objects, and an aggregated relationship layer derived from at least two layers of the relationship layers, and wherein each layer has a graph with one vertex for every object represented in the network and at least one unidirectional and/or bidirectional edge between at least two of the objects, and calculating the edge weights based on the edge weights of at least two relationship layers, selecting at least the relationship with a highest edge weight between an object and other objects, and finally outputting the weights of the selected relationships as the calculated relationship metrics.
