This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 803 404 filed on Jun. 25 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 266 005 which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 004 187 filed on Dec. 20 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 783 523 which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 346 989 filed on Jan. 17 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 337 151 all the foregoing of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.

In a typical construction design a set of construction plan drawings are generated usually with a computer implemented tool such as an architectural CAD Computer Aided Design software product. Disadvantageously the various elements and materials of the construction project for example windows doors skylights acrylic glass blocks and the like are priced out in estimating the cost of the job in a completely separate process and usually only by one manufacturer. This separate process very disadvantageously adds a significant amount of time and effort to the process of generating a construction job price. Also very disadvantageously because different construction materials of varying quality and cost can generally be used on the same construction job or project the cost amounts that are set forth on a price schedule that is generated by this separate process can vary by a very wide margin. Further and also disadvantageously in the event that the price schedule needs to be changed for example due to cost overruns competitive bidding and or other factors a new price schedule must be generated with an additional significant investment of time and effort involved for each such revision. Again this adds a significant amount of extra expense to a construction project and this typical process limits the flexibility in selected various construction materials for contractors and end use customers.

It is important to provide a price rather than an estimate for a proposed construction project. In order for a bank or other lending institution to approve a construction loan for a proposed construction project the bank generally requires an accurate price for the construction project and will not rely upon an estimate because estimates are often extremely inaccurate. If a bank does accept an estimate and the estimate turns out to be lower than the final price for the construction project the bank which has control in such a situation may then additionally charge large points and or fees for the construction loan substantially raising the price of the construction project which is very undesirable. If the estimate turns out to be lower than the final price this often results in construction cost overruns construction time delays and dissatisfaction of customers.

Most of the time when architectural plans are drawn the plans are drawn inaccurately. If an architectural plan is drawn inaccurately and a price is provided for a corresponding construction project this situation generally presents significant problems with respect to construction cost overruns construction time delays and the satisfaction of customers homeowners or building owners .

Wakelam et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 859 768 B1 describe a computer implemented automated building design and modeling system DMES system that includes a database column 4 lines 30 32 that provides a central source for all design and construction information for a construction project abstract column 1 lines 57 67 and claim 1 . Ordinary elements and massing elements are assembled into a building model according to a sequential assembly hierarchy thus assembling a complete building model automatically . . . abstract and claim 11 . Software for a commercially available cost estimating system represented as 112 in the figures as well as software for several other systems that may be employed in a network implementation of the DMES system is stored on a hard drive of a computer FIG. 1 and column 7 lines 45 62 . The cost estimating system produces a cost estimate not a price which is implemented using Ice 2000 computer software.

In contrast with the present invention Wakelam et al. do not describe the production of a price quote or a price schedule. It is clear from a detailed review of Wakelam et al. that the systems and processes described therein only produce an estimate a cost estimate which is for a production of an entire building. See for example FIGS. 2g 2h 2i 2j 2k and 6b the abstract Appendix A and column 1 lines 51 54 column 3 lines 42 46 column 7 lines 37 43 column 9 lines 8 31 and the claims of Wakelam et al. .

The cost estimating system that is described by Wakelam et al. for producing cost estimates is one of several different systems that are implemented with the DMES system described therein and is a known computer software named Ice 2000 that is commercially available from MCManagement Computer Controls Inc. and described on the MCManagement Computer Controls Inc. mc2 ice web site column 7 lines 55 58 .

Also in contrast with the present invention Wakelam et al. does not describe an ability to determine a price quote or price schedule for only one or two construction plan elements such as only a window or only a window and a door. It is clear from a detailed review of Wakelam et al. including FIGS. 1 6 that the processes and systems that are described therein only provide a cost estimate only a ball park figure regarding what the actual cost of designing and building a building may be for the production of an entire building i.e. not for individual construction products such as a window a door an acrylic glass block a sky light or the like . The cost estimate for the entire building includes cost estimate data for a wide variety of materials components and labor such as electrical devices equipment and wiring lights HVAC systems elevators and man hours of labor involved in the fabrication of the building as well as construction products such as windows and doors.

As a result of the above difference the methods and systems of the present invention are advantageously much more versatile than the methods and systems that are described by Wakelam et al. For example the present invention can be employed in small or large residential or commercial remodeling construction projects as well as for constructing entire new residential or commercial buildings. In contrast the methods and systems described by Wakelam et al. can only be used for the construction of an entire new building.

Also in contrast with embodiments within the present invention Wakelam et al. does not describe a process or system having a plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within a software design tool on a local computer such as architectural CAD but rather uses a stand alone interview based system and a commercially available cost estimation software named Ice 2000. It is clear from a detailed review of Wakelam et al. that the processes and systems that are described therein are stand alone processes and systems that can work in a network along with the DMES system.

Moreover Wakelam et al. which describe a very complicated system that is employed to construct an entire building using a series of multiple tiers and hierarchies teach away from the use of architectural CAD a software design tool by stating the following at Column 4 Lines 38 59 and Column 18 Lines 7 23 respectively 

Further in contrast with embodiments within the present invention Wakelam et al. does not describe a process or system that employs a zip code of a construction site to access price data from a web site on a remote server system an external or other physical storage medium or the like. Wakelam et al. does not describe a process or system that employs a web site that includes price data for a purchase of one or more construction plan elements in a geographical location within a zip code or otherwise. Further in contrast with the cost estimates described by Wakelam et al. the price data described herein can be relied upon to purchase one or more construction plan or other elements.

In contrast with embodiments within the processes and systems of the invention the processes and systems that are described by Wakelam et al. are very complicated perhaps because an entire building is being assembled and include an assembly hierarchy having five or more tiers.

Further in contrast with embodiments within the present invention Wakelam et al. do not describe a an insertion of a price schedule into a construction plan b a price schedule that contains a list of construction plan elements with corresponding price quotes c a placing of an order to purchase one or more construction plan elements d a placing of an order to purchase one or more construction plan elements using a local computer or a web site on a remote server or both e a placing of an order to purchase one or more construction plan elements using a credit card and a local computer or a web site on a remote server or both or f a creation of a price schedule including one or two construction plan elements.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 446 053 B1 Elliott describes a computer implemented method and system for producing a proposal for a construction project title . The system includes a central site with various databases and a user site connected for electronic communication over a networked communication system such as the Internet abstract . The user site includes a computer having stored in memory an application that enables a user to develop a construction proposal including a detailed graphical model and a detailed cost estimate model have the proposal submitted electronically over a networked communication system to a construction professional for a bid and receive a response on the proposal from the construction professional over the networked communications system abstract . The application educates the user as it guides the user through a series of construction phases and steps prompting the user to input critical information and make appropriate selections throughout the series of phases and steps abstract . The method and system provide a proposal and a cost estimate not a final price abstract .

In contrast with embodiments within the methods and systems of the present invention Elliott 1 does not employ a plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within a software design tool on a local computer such as architectural CAD but rather uses a stand alone interview based system 2 does not insert parametric symbols into a construction plan 3 does not using an add on computer software code transmit data corresponding to inserted parametric symbols from a local computer over the Internet to a remote server system 4 use a zip code and an add on computer software code to access price data from a web site on a remote server system or 5 determine from price data a price quote for each of several construction elements but rather provides only a cost estimate.

Both Wakelam et al. and Elliott use stand alone computer software for cost estimation that does not include an add on plug in computer software code. Wakelam et al. uses commercially available Ice 2000 column 7 lines 55 58 and Elliott uses a software package not named that is preferably installed on the hard disc of a user s computer column 5 lines 25 27 .

Further Elliott does not teach or suggest the creation of a construction plan using a software design tool such as architectural CAD. In contrast Elliott describes col. 6 lines 43 50 and col. 10 lines 20 24 the scanning of a photograph or construction plan into a user s computer to produce a digital image which is a completely different process.

Additionally the systems of both Wakelam et al. and Elliott provide only an estimate for the products described therein and not a final price. This is a very important distinction between the present invention and the teachings of Wakelam et al. and Elliott. For the reasons that follow it is important to obtain a price rather than an estimate. Generally lending institutions will not rely upon an estimate when considering whether or not to make a construction loan because estimates are often extremely inaccurate and such inaccuracy often results in large construction cost overruns and significant construction time delays. Further a price is binding upon the person or entity that provides the price whereas an estimate does not bind a person or entity to a particular price. Therefore a person or entity that provides a price must honor their price or may be sued for not doing so even if the construction job for which the price was quoted ends up costing significantly more money than the price quoted causing the person or entity that quoted the price to lose a significant amount of money. This is not true of an estimate which does not bind a person or entity to a particular price. As can be seen it is significantly more risky to provide a price in comparison with an estimate which is the reason why contractors generally only provide estimates i.e. they do not want to be bound to a particular price . Further it is a much more complex process to provide a price an assigned amount of money that is required to be paid in order to make a purchase in comparison with an estimate a rough calculation . Elliott itself acknowledges this fact by stating Calculating the material quantities and costs of large construction projects can be very complicated column 1 lines 25 26 .

Moreover neither Wakelam et al. nor Elliott teach or suggest the use of a zip code to determine price data for one or more construction plan elements. Although Elliott discusses zip codes such discussion only relates to the average labor rate the average price of land the average cost of builder s risk insurance and building permit costs not to construction plan elements col. 4 lines 44 62 . The foregoing items are completely different from construction plan elements and the pricing of the foregoing items would be completely different from the pricing of construction plan elements.

In contrast with embodiments within the present invention neither Wakelam et al. nor Elliott teach or suggest any of the following 

 2 a price schedule that contains a list of construction plan elements with corresponding price quotes 

 6 a plug in add on computer software code and a web site that permit a user to place an order to purchase one or more of the construction plan elements that are present in a price schedule.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 810 401 B2 Thompson et al. describes an automated configuration system and method for facilitating the configuration of desired products services or other assemblages that require users to gather and assimilate disparate knowledge of makes models types features codes and prices of the desired product service to be configured abstract . In accordance with a preferred embodiment configuration is facilitated through interaction of a user with a frame engine that performs frame based inferences to discern stored knowledge of a product or the like as supplemented by a rules based inference system column 1 lines 30 34 .

In contrast with embodiments within the methods and systems of the present invention Thompson et al. describe a configuration system that does not use a plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within a software design tool on a local computer such as architectural CAD. Further a construction product such as a window or door cannot be drawn in architectural CAD using the Thompson et al. system because the Thompson et al. system does not work in architectural CAD. In contrast a construction product may only be cut and pasted into architectural CAD in the same manner that a picture can be cut and pasted into a Word document . The configuration system of Thompson et al. is just drawing a picture on a computer. Moreover the Thompson et al. system can only provide a price for one type of a construction product such as a window at a time and provides a very slow process for providing such price. For example in contrast with the methods and systems of the present invention the system of Thompson et al. cannot provide a price for both a window and a door at the same time or using the same computer software. Very disadvantageously the Thompson et al. system must use a different type of software for each different type of construction product for example four different softwares for a window a door an acrylic glass block and a sky light which is very time consuming and expensive.

In contrast with the Thompson et al. system embodiments within the methods and system of the present invention uses a plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within a software design tool on a local computer such as architectural CAD. A product such as a bay window can be drawn in architectural CAD and may then be imbedded into a wall of a room or structure such as a Great Room. The window preferably gets sized and then may optionally be burned into a wall so that one can clearly see exactly what the window will look like when it is added to the room and embedded into the wall. The burning of the window into the wall is a function of the plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within the architectural CAD program or otherwise . The system that is described by Thompson et al. does not do this. Such system is not working in architectural CAD. Further with the methods and systems of the present invention changes may be made to the window while embedded into the wall in a room or otherwise and the changes to the window can then be clearly viewed while the window is embedded into the wall in a room or otherwise . These methods and systems can provide a price a final price and not an estimate very rapidly for one or more different types of construction or other products which is tricky i.e. not easily accomplished . With the methods and systems of the present invention it is possible to obtain a price for a construction or other product such as a window or door from as many as fifteen or more different manufacturers and or distributors or others at the same time an average price in the geographic or other area or any other type of a desired or required price. Further the present invention optionally may use a zip code to obtain and provide price data for the purchase of one or more construction or other products which includes a subtotal tax and a final price. Very advantageously the construction or other products can be purchased the same day i.e. immediately .

None of Thompson et al. Wakelam et al. or Elliott teach or suggest any of the following steps elements or limitations of embodiments within the methods and systems of the present invention 

Further Thompson et al. does not teach or suggest 1 providing a construction plan on a local computer 2 creating a construction plan with a software design tool or 3 providing on a local computer a palette that includes at least one parametric symbol.

The products that are described by Thompson et al. cannot be drawn in an architectural CAD or other software design tool. In contrast they may only be assembled in such a tool by an architect a different user with a different computer . With the use of human intervention i.e. no automation drawings that are created by the Thompson et al. system can be sent or exported to an architect for example using e mail and the architect can then cut and paste the drawings into an architectural CAD program that the architect is using. The Thompson et al. system merely allows one to cut and paste drawings of products into a CAD program. For example a window could be drawn in Microsoft Word using its drawing tools and such drawing could be considered to be a CAD drawing because it is a computer assisted drawing i.e. a computer assists a user in drawing the window . Further the drawing could be e mailed to an architect to be inserted into an architectural CAD program. However in contrast with the methods and systems of the present invention the user is not working in an architectural CAD program and the drawing is not an add on to an architectural CAD program.

In contrast with the above the methods and systems of the present invention perform one or more sets of operations in a software design tool such as architectural CAD using an add on plug in computer software program. With this invention no human intervention is generally required or desired i.e. it is automated and drawings can be burned inserted into a construction plan that has been designed using an architectural CAD program or other software design tool .

Further the Thompson et al. system can only be employed with one single product type such as a window whereas the methods and systems of the present invention can draw and price multiple different projects such as a window a door and an acrylic glass block and rapidly provide comparison pricing for the various products from multiple different manufacturers and or distributors or others .

Moreover like Wakelam et al. and Elliott Thompson et al. does not teach or suggest the use of a zip code to determine price data for one or more construction plan or other elements. Additionally Thompson et al. do not teach or suggest 

 1 placing an order to purchase one or more of the construction plan or other elements that are present in a price schedule because no price schedule is created by Thompson et al. or

 2 a system wherein an add on plug in computer software code and a web site permit a user to place an order to purchase one or more construction plan or other elements.

U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2001 0047250 A1 Schuller et al. describes a computer implemented method of visualizing a decorating project abstract . The method includes rendering an image of a building space e.g. a room that includes a number of structural objects such as doors walls and furniture abstract . The structural objects may be portrayed in the rendered image with visual characteristics that are determined by decorative materials such as paint fabric or wallpaper associated with the objects abstract . Schuller et al. also describe a computer implemented decorating system that includes a server operatively coupled to a memory a database and a network over which data can be exchanged with client computers abstract . The memory includes software instructions to configure the server to retrieve modeling software from the database in response to requests from client computers and to send the modeling software over the network to the client computers abstract . The modeling software includes instructions to configure the client computers to model structural objects to associate decorative materials with the structural objects and to render an image of a building space abstract . The rendered image portrays structural objects in accordance with visual characteristic of associated decorative materials abstract .

In contrast with embodiments within the methods and systems of the present invention the decorating system of Schuller et al. 1 does not employ a plug in add on computer software code that runs as an internal component within a software design tool on a local computer such as architectural CAD but rather uses a stand alone computer program and 2 does not employ a zip code to provide any prices. Although Schuller et al. state that their implementations can include automated purchasing of structural objects and decorative materials Schuller et al. do not describe how this may be accomplished.

None of Thompson et al. Wakelam et al. Elliott or Schuller et al. teach or suggest any of the following steps elements or limitations of embodiments within the present invention 

Additionally Schuller et al. do not teach or suggest 1 providing a construction plan on a local computer 2 creating a construction plan with a software design tool or 3 providing on a local computer a palette that includes at least one parametric symbol.

The teachings of Schuller et al. are clearly limited to the visualization of a decoration project page 1 paragraphs 0006 and 0007 and do not discuss construction projects.

Further the input images that are discussed by Schuller et al. are obtained using a digital image capture device such as a scanner digital camera or video signal capture device and not a software design tool such as CAD page 1 paragraph 0009 .

The method and system of Schuller et al. which are drawn to the decoration of a room with for example paint wallpaper and fabric page 2 paragraphs 0023 and 0028 are much simpler and quite different in comparison with the methods and systems of the present invention which are drawn to construction projects and the pricing of one or more construction elements. Such pricing is quite tricky i.e. is not easily accomplished .

Like Wakelam et al. Elliott and Thompson et al. Schuller et al. do not teach or suggest the use of a zip code to determine price data for one or more construction plan elements.

While Schuller et al. do discuss an automatic purchasing of furnishings and decorating materials page 5 paragraph 0049 page 7 paragraph 0067 and claims 11 12 29 and 30 Schuller et al. do not specify the mechanism that is employed to procure pricing for such purchasing. The teachings that are present in Schuller et al. regarding an automated purchasing are very vague.

Moreover Schuller et al. do not teach or suggest the use of an add on plug in computer software code to a software design tool that permits a user to pay for an order using a credit card.

A need in the architectural construction and other industries currently exists for rapidly efficiently and cost effectively generating and modifying a set of construction or other plans for one or more construction or other elements and a corresponding price quote schedule for such construction or other elements in one general process wherein a user can rapidly procure one two three four five or more comparative prices from one two three four five or more different manufacturers distributors or others which may be competitors to determine the best most competitive final price for the various construction or other elements that will be used in the set of construction or other plans.

Very advantageously the present invention provides methods and systems for rapidly efficiently and cost effectively generating and modifying a set of residential or commercial construction or other plan drawings for one or more construction or other elements and optionally a corresponding price quote schedule for such construction or other elements in one general process wherein a user can rapidly procure one two three four five or more comparative prices from one two three four five or more different manufacturers distributors and or others individuals corporations partnerships other businesses entities organizations universities computers computer systems and or the like that can provide such information either directly or indirectly which may be competitors to determine the best most competitive average or other real time final price for the various construction or other elements that may be used in the set of construction architectural civil engineering industrial engineering or other plans.

The difficulties and drawbacks that are associated with the above described systems are advantageously overcome by the present invention which is a method and system for an automated creation of a price schedule for a construction or other project. The present invention comprises steps and an implementation for providing a set of one or more construction plan or other drawings created with a software design tool and optionally a palette of one or a plurality of architectural 2D and or 3D parametric symbols corresponding to one or more respective construction elements. Optionally but preferably at least one parametric symbol generic or manufacturer distributor other specific corresponding to each construction element is inserted into the construction plan drawings. A cost value for one or more and preferably each of the inserted parametric symbols and or of the construction plan elements is calculated corresponding to respective construction elements. A price schedule may optionally be automatically manually and or otherwise created including the total or other cost for one or more or all of the inserted parametric symbols corresponding to respective construction elements or for one or more construction elements if no palette of parametric symbols is employed using one or a plurality of the same or different computers consoles web sites databases and or the like including pricing information for construction plan or other elements and or parametric symbols. Such price schedule can optionally provide comparison pricing between two or more different manufacturers distributors and or others for the same construction or other element s or parametric symbols for example the pricing of a bay window for a kitchen having a variety of specified features white in color vinyl frame Low E glass Argon filled glass a specified number of grids corresponding grid patterns etc. from 1stWindows Andersen Windows and Pella Corporation. The price schedule may include one or a plurality of prices which preferably are the same prices that are procured using the systems and methods of the invention but optionally may be different prices obtained from one or a plurality of other web sites databases manufacturers vendors distributors and or the like.

A price schedule including one or a plurality of selected construction plan or other elements or parametric symbols which optionally but preferably correspond to construction plan elements or both and corresponding or other prices may optionally be inserted into the construction plan drawing. Additionally or alternatively a user may place an order for one or a plurality or all of selected construction plan or other elements or parametric symbols or both automatically using the systems and or methods of the invention including a use of one or a plurality of local and or remote computers or consoles local and or remote servers databases and or the like or manually using some other method as is known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as otherwise using one or a plurality of computers or consoles web sites telephones facsimile machines U.S. or foreign mail carriers or deliverers or in person at a facility of a manufacturer distributor or other provider of construction plan or other elements and or the like or any combination thereof.

As will be realized the present invention is capable of a wide variety of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of numerous modifications in various respects all without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly the description and accompanying figures are to be regarded as illustrative and not restrictive.

The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.

For purposes of clarity various terms and phrases used throughout this specification and the appended claims are defined in the manner set forth below. If a term or phrase used in this specification or in the appended claims is not defined below or otherwise in this specification the term or phrase should be given its ordinary meaning.

The term about as is used herein means approximately as is known and may be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art.

The term ActiveX as is used herein means a framework for defining reusable software components in a programming language independent way. Software applications can then be composed from one or more of these components in order to provide their functionality in a manner known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

The phrase adaptor as is used herein means a hardware device such as a printed circuit board that enables a computer to use one or more additional peripheral devices and or pieces of hardware.

The phrase application as is used herein means software other than the operating system such as Word processors database managers Web browsers and or the like. Each application generally has its own user interface that allows a user to interact with a particular program. The user interface for most operating systems and applications is a graphical user interface GUI which uses graphical screen elements such as windows which are used to separate the screen into distinct work areas icons which are small images that represent computer resources such as files pull down menus which give a user a list of options scroll bars which allow a user to move up and down a window and buttons which can be pushed with a click of a mouse . A wide variety of applications is known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

The phrases Application Program Interface and API as are used herein mean a set of commands functions and or protocols that computer programmers can use when building software for a specific operating system. The API allows programmers to use predefined functions to interact with an operating system instead of writing them from scratch. All computer operating systems such as Windows Unix and the Mac OS usually provide an application program interface for programmers. APIs are also used by hardware devices that can run software programs. While the API makes the programmer s job easier it also benefits the end user since it generally ensures that all programs using the same API will have a similar user interface.

The phrases architectural CAD software architectural Computer Aided Design software and architectural software design tool as are used herein refer to specialized computer software computer readable instructions and or data typically in the form of a code that enable engineers architects and or others to design structures such as rooms houses commercial buildings construction elements doors windows walls floors ceilings and the like furniture and the like on a computer for example TurboCAD V8 software version 9 AutoCAD software versions 2002 2004 and 2005 AutoCAD Architectural Desktop 2002 and 2004 and Autodesk Map 5 6 and 3D. Often in addition to this specialized software architectural CAD systems use a graphics monitor a light pen or digitizing tablet for drawing and a special printer or plotter for printing design specifications. Architectural CAD software and other architectural Computer Aided Design software is commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art for example from CAD companies directly or from CAD software dealers such as Design Integrations Inc. Marietta Ga. .

The phrases Bill of Materials and BOM as are used herein mean a list of one or a plurality of raw or other materials sub assemblies intermediate assemblies sub components components parts and or the like and or the quantities of the same that are required or desired to manufacture or otherwise produce one or a plurality of end items final products . It may include one or a plurality of price statements indications and or items of data and or information and is a type of a price schedule.

The phrases boot loader or boot manager as are used herein mean a relatively small program that places the operating system of a computer into memory. When a computer is powered up or restarted the basic input output system BIOS typically performs some initial tests and then transfers control to the Master Boot Record MBR where the boot loader typically resides. Most new computers are shipped with boot loaders for some version of Microsoft Windows or the Mac OS. If a computer is to be used with Linux a special boot loader must typically be installed. For Linux the two most common boot loaders are known as LILO Linux Loader and LOADLIN LOAD LINux . An alternative boot loader called GRUB GRand Unified Bootloader is used with Red Hat Linux. LILO is typically the most popular boot loader among computer users that employ Linux as the main or only operating system. The primary advantage of LILO is the fact that it allows for fast boot up. LOADLIN is preferred by some users whose computers have multiple operating systems and who spend relatively little time in Linux. LOADLIN is sometimes used as a backup boot loader for Linux in case LILO fails. GRUB is preferred by many users of Red Hat Linux because it is the default boot loader for that distribution.

The phrase breather tube as used herein means a small metal tube that is placed into an insulated unit s spacer to equalize pressure differences. Breather tubes can allow moisture to enter into the insulating unit and are mostly used in high altitude locations.

The phrases building products and construction elements as are used herein include but are not limited to windows doors acrylic glass or other blocks fireplaces sky lights cabinets fireplaces Forced Air Units drywall lumber insulation molding laminates plumbing fixtures electrical fixtures and the like.

The term byte as is used herein refers to a unit of memory in a memory location or device of a computer. The storage capacity of a memory location or device such as a main or secondary memory hard disks floppy disks CD ROMs and the like of a computer is the total number of bytes that it can hold. Some computers can store thousands or millions of bytes. A large main memory permits large programs or many programs to run.

This module is a translation module. It takes the data from the plan drawer s or other user s computer and or console and formats it into a standard format for the 1stPricing server and or 1stWindows server or other server . The module sends the formatted information to the server subsequently receives back from the server formatted data and then makes the formatted data available to the CAD or other software design program. CAD programs generally have copyrighted custom programming that is unique. The inventors have created developed and standardized a way to get or otherwise procure pricing data and or information from the pricing server so that it is not necessary to have a separate server for each of the types of CAD program. In essence there are CAD companies that speak all different languages. For example CAD company speaks language A CAD company speaks language B and CAD company speaks language C. If for example the 1stPricing server only speaks language Z when CAD company comes in speaking language A it goes through the communication module and the communication module translates the data and or information from CAD language A to CAD language Z and then sends it to the 1stPricing server. The server interprets the data and or information and sends back the information to the module with pricing data and or other data RFID tags geospatial information product specification information and or the like . The module then translates the language from language Z back to language A and then sends it to CAD company . From there it is displayed to the CAD user. As used in the methods and systems of the present invention the optional communication modules typically permit all CAD and other software design tool companies to enter as an additional method for communicating with the server on the 1stPricing or other web site.

Since software is virtual and does not take up any physical space it is generally easier and often less expensive to upgrade than computer hardware. Computer software is often continuously upgraded and improved. CD ROMs DVDs and other types of media which are known by those having ordinary skill in the art can be used to distribute software. When one purchases or otherwise procures a software program it usually comes on a disc which is a physical means for storing the software. Many software programs require that one first install them on a computer before using them. For example if one purchases Microsoft Office it needs to be installed on a computer before one can run any of the included programs such as Word or Excel. The software can be installed from a CD or DVD an external hard drive or from a networked computer or the like. A software program or software update can also often be installed using a file that is downloaded from the Internet. Installing a software program generally writes the necessary data for running a program on a computer s hard drive. Often the installer program will decompress the data that is included with the installer immediately before writing the information to a hard drive. Software updates which are often downloaded from the Internet generally work the same way. When an update is run the installer file generally decompresses the data and then updates the correct program or operating system. Installing software usually involves double clicking an installer icon and then clicking I Agree when the license agreement pops up. A computer operator may have to choose what directory on a hard disk that the software should be installed in but often the installer will even choose that for the computer operator. Some software can be installed by simply dragging a folder or application program onto a hard drive.

Large midrange systems such as those that are commercially available from Sun Microsystems Inc. Palo Alto Calif. Hewlett Packard Company Palo Alto Calif. and IBM Armonk N.Y. generally still use serial consoles. In larger installations the console ports are typically attached to multiplexers or network connected multiport serial servers that permit an operator to connect his computer terminal to any of the attached servers. On programmable computers PCs and workstations the computer s attached keyboard and or monitor typically have the equivalent function. Because monitor cables generally carry video signals they typically cannot be extended to a significant distance from the computer i.e. typically not father than about 200 feet and if amplified about 1 000 feet . Often installations with many servers therefore use keyboard video multiplexers KVM switches and possibly video amplifiers to centralize console access. In recent years KVM IP devices have become commercially available from sources known by those having ordinary skill in the art which allow a remote computer i.e. a computer to which a user does not have physical access but which he or she can access and or manipulate via some kind of network to view video output and or send keyboard input via any TCP IP network and therefore the Internet. Some PC BIOSes particularly in servers also support serial consoles giving access to the BIOS through a serial port so that the simpler and cheaper serial console infrastructure can be used. Even where BIOS support is lacking some operating systems e.g. FreeBSD and Linux can be configured for serial console operation either during bootup or after startup. It is usually possible to log in from the console. Depending upon configuration the operating system may treat a login session from the console as being more trustworthy than a login session from other sources. Routers and managed switches as well as other networking and telecoms equipment may also have console ports in particular Cisco Systems Inc.

The present invention is directed to an automated pricing system in which a price schedule for a construction product such as a window is optionally but typically generated and inserted directly into a set of construction project or other architectural civil industrial or other plans. For example in a preferred embodiment the construction product can be a construction material such as a window an acrylic glass block a door a skylight and or the like and is inset into the construction plans. Of course it is to be understood that any number of product types can be employed and any other different symbols can be employed in a different embodiment other than construction materials without departing from the present invention. The description that follows with particular applicability to construction materials should be regarded as exemplary and not limiting.

The present invention is preferably implemented using a plug in or add on computer software code component that has an ability to work within or outside of an architectural CAD Computer Aided Design software product or other software design tool and with an online 1stPricing 1stWindows or similar database or with an offline database. While most of the discussion that is set forth herein refers to the 1stPricing online web site or database the 1stWindows online web site or database or a similar web site or database or a database that is not on line may also be employed. Each construction plan or other element selected by a user such as a window an acrylic glass block a door and or a skylight is optionally but preferably inset into the building or other plans via one or more selected parametric symbols that are optionally but preferably present in the plug in add on computer software code. Alternatively or additionally parametric symbols may be present in a software design tool i.e. already existing or may not be present at all as is discussed hereinbelow. Each parametric symbol optionally but preferably adds a combined two dimensional and or three dimensional representation of the associated corresponding construction product to the construction plans.

Very advantageously a cost value final price can be calculated by an online 1stPricing or similar database or offline database or using some other database or web site for one or a plurality of or each selected construction plan or other element and or parametric symbol which may optionally advantageously include a price comparison for one or a plurality of or each selected construction product between different available manufacturers distributors and or other entities individuals systems and or devices within a selected zip code or nationally i.e. not within any one or more particular zip codes but within the country state or other geographic region or area in order that a user may optionally procure the best or most competitive price for one or a plurality of or each selected construction product and a total final cost can then optionally but very advantageously automatically and virtually instantaneously be calculated by the same database typically within from about 5 to about 15 seconds for an entire set of construction elements all of the selected parametric symbols . Other types of prices such as an average price cost or a general price cost or any other type of a price cost for a construction plan or other element or parametric symbol or both in a particular geographic region or area or nationally and or the like may additionally or alternatively be procured by a user. The systems and methods of the present invention work using any type and or source of pricing and or green databases regardless of the source of the databases and regardless of the type of price and or green information desired required or procured. Advantageously a price schedule that includes the foregoing costs can then optionally automatically manually or otherwise and virtually instantaneously be created typically within about 1 to about 13 seconds by the online 1stPricing database or a different database and then the price schedule advantageously can optionally but preferably be inset directly into the building or other plans by the plug in add on computer software code so that the building plans themselves advantageously can optionally include one or a plurality of or each selected parametric symbol and or construction plan or other element as well as a final price schedule for all such parametric symbols and or construction plan or other elements. The price schedule advantageously may contain a detailed list of the selected construction products with attached corresponding pricing to provide a total cost value therefore. The price schedule can also optionally be exported as a standalone object in the form of various common computer applications or formats including but not limited to Excel Word Plain Text HTML XML PDF and the like.

When writing a computer program a programmer typically tries to solve a particular problem by for example understanding the problem breaking the problem into manageable units designing a solution considering alternatives to the solution refining the solution implementing the solution by writing a program in the form of code and testing the solution fixing any problems. When developing software separate pieces are generally designed that are responsible for different parts of the solution and then are subsequently put together. A program is written in a particular programming language such as Java an object oriented programming language in which objects are the basic pieces that make up a program Ada C C Pascal or Smithtalk which typically employ specific words and symbols to express the problem solution. Different programming languages define different sets of rules that determine exactly how a programmer can combine the words and symbols of the language into programming statements instructions that are carried out when a program is executed .

Four general categories of programming languages currently exist and include machine language assembly language high level languages and fourth generation languages. In order for a particular program to run on a computer the program must generally be in the computer s machine language. Each type of a CPU typically has its own machine language. Because machine language code is expressed as a series of binary digits such code is difficult for human beings to read and write. While assembly language which employs relatively short words that represent commands or data is significantly easier for programmers to use a program in this language generally cannot be executed directly on a computer. It generally first needs to be translated into machine language. Most programmers employ high level language such as Java Ada C C and Smithtalk to write software which employs phrases and is relatively easy for programmers to read and write but must also generally be translated into machine language before it can be executed for example using a commercially available compiler and or interpreter. A wide variety of commercially available Software Development Kits SDKs are often used by programmers to develop software such as the Java Software Development Kit which includes a compiler an interpreter and several other software tools that may be useful for a programmer and may be downloaded at no cost from the Sun Microsoft web site. In addition Integrated Development Environments IDEs programs that combine an editor compiler and other Java support tools may be used by programmers to support a development of Java programs. One of these programs known as NetBeans incorporates the development tools provided by Java Software Development Kits into one convenient GUI based program and may be downloaded at no cost from the NetBeans web site. A similar Integrated Development Environment IDEs that is called Eclipse and is promoted by IBM may be downloaded at no cost from its web site.

A wide variety of computer software programs and operating systems that may be employed in the systems and methods of the invention are commercially available from sources that are know by those having ordinary skill in the art such as Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. Dell Inc. Round Rock Tex. Apple Computer Inc. Cupertino Calif. Hewlett Packard Company Palo Alto Calif. 1st Windows 1st Pricing and similar computer software supply or other companies and or may be written by computer programmers having ordinary skill in the art. The present in invention is not limited to any particular type number or version of computer software programs or operating systems or to any particular manufacturer or distributor of computer software or operating system. As is well known by those having ordinary skill in the art more than one computer software program or version thereof and often a wide variety of computer software programs and versions thereof or combined software programs may be used to perform the same function on or in connection with a computer. Also computer software programs that may retain the same function are often routinely or continuously updated or enhanced sometimes with the use of plug in or add in computer code and or with other enhancements additions deletions and or substitutions to existing code. Thus any type and number of computer software programs and or operating systems may be employed in the systems and methods of the present invention as long as they have an ability to perform the functions that are described herein and such computer software and operating system may be procured from any known or other computer software manufacturer or distributor or store or generated by a computer programmer having ordinary skill in the art. Further additional computer programs may be employed in the systems and methods of the invention as long as they are compatible with computer programs that are required for the invention to properly operate which may readily be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art.

There are several general categories of computer software that may be employed in the systems and methods of the invention. Programming software generally come in forms of tools that assist a programmer in writing computer programs sets of logical instructions that make a computer system perform certain tasks . The tools that help the programmers in instructing a computer system include text editors compilers and interpreters. System software helps in running the computer hardware and the computer system and is a collection of operating systems devise drivers servers windowing systems and or utilities. System software helps an application programmer in abstracting away from hardware memory and other internal complexities of a computer. Application software enables the end users to accomplish certain specific tasks. Business software databases and educational software are some forms of application software. Different word processors which are dedicated for specialized tasks to be performed by the user are other examples of application software. Utility software helps in the management of computer hardware and application software and performs a relatively small range of tasks such as disk defragmenters systems utilities and virus scanners. Data backup and recovery software provides functionalities beyond simple copying of data files. This software often supports user needs of specifying what is to be backed up and when. Backup and recovery software generally preserve the original organization of files and allow an easy retrieval of the backed up data. Installation software functions to prepare an application software package to run in a computer. Typically combined with the application it is installing the install program creates a folder with a default name on the hard disk and copies the application files to that folder. The complete installation package is generally either an Internet download or on a CD ROM DVD ROM or a diskette. Application files are generally compressed in the package and the install program decompresses them into their original format and respective folders. With Windows applications the install program often adds or updates extensions to Windows that reside in the Windows folder. It is also customary for the install program to deposit an uninstall option so the application can be easily removed later on. Install programs may also be used to attach a new peripheral device to a computer. The install program may add the device s driver to the operating system or it may be used to set or reset parameters in an updatable memory flash memory EEPROM etc. on the expansion board that has been plugged in. Security software provides some measure of security from attack to a an individual computer or a computer that forms part of a network and the data present therein. Document display software functions to display text documents on a display screen so that they can be read and or modified. Networking software such as Microsoft Outlook and Internet Explorer function to permit communication over a network via email Internet and or the like and or allow a user to perform network maintenance troubleshooting and or setup. Computer configuration software functions to configure a computer for usage for example setting up graphics cards performing maintenance such as cleanup and or error detection on hard drives and or to install configure and or uninstall other hardware components on the computer. Database software development software functions to create maintain and or query databases that can be used as standalone databases and or have them incorporated into one or more other software programs. Software development software functions to permit a user to write one or more software programs that will run execute on one or a plurality of different software programs.

In order for the systems and methods of the invention to work in addition to the computer hardware and peripheral devices discussed herein there must be a specialized add on plug in computer software code program written specifically for this purpose or otherwise procured which may run either internally within the software design program or externally outside of the software design tool operating in the latter as a dynamic link library executable .exe ActiveX COM object or combination thereof and or the like. This code typically is to be compiled from the source code into an executable code to be run on one or a plurality of local or remote computers using the computer operating system for which it is compiled.

The systems and methods of the invention use data and or properties that are optionally but preferably attached to one or more parametric symbols via the add on plug in computer code permitting such parametric symbols which may be present in the add on computer code in the software design tool or otherwise to be recognized when sent or otherwise transmitted by a user from one or more local or remote computers to one or more local or remote or other databases. Extremely advantageously such add on computer code databases systems and methods may generally be employed by a user in a wide variety of different manners in a wide variety of different scenarios including but not limited to the following and any combination thereof 

In scenario A above for example one add on computer code can be used in connection multiple different CAD or other software design tool manufacturers distributors and or other individuals or entities and with a wide variety of different CAD or other software design tool products manufactured distributed and or otherwise provided by different companies including but not limited to Autodesk Revit Autodesk Architecture ArchiCAD Autodesk Inventor Autodesk Civil Vectorworks TurboCAD Chief Architect SoftDesk SoftCAD Softplan Microstation SketchUp and or the like via the communication module that is described and illustrated herein with a plurality of different databases. In scenario E for example one specific add on computer code may be written for and or employed with only one type of CAD or other software design tool product from only one CAD or other software design tool manufacturer or distributor and or only work with one specific database. For example in the case of a window the window code identifier assigned to the window may be for example XO or any other symbol chosen by a user and the particular properties and or features that make up such XO window such as width and height are sent by the user to one database for example as P width X and P Height X or using any other symbols chosen by the user . The system then looks for a match in the database of XO with the properties of P and P. When the system locates a similar or exact match the system will send back from the database to the user s desk top lap top or other computer information and or data including but not limited to that regarding pricing owners manual warranty information and or the like. The system is typically set up to transmit back to the user s computer any such information and or alphanumeric text which may or may not be present in a file PDF file text file word document text file xml logos and or the like . Further and very advantageously there is no limit to the number of properties features and or attributes that a particular parametric symbol and or construction plan element may have such as one or a plurality. The system can work with items that have at least one identifying code and no properties one property multiple properties and or the like.

When a communication module is installed as part of the plug in computer software code or as a companion component working together with the plug in code the software development time and programming code required to make the CAD or other software design tool software functional is typically reduced. Each software design tool vendor and vendor version can require different computer programming languages C C .net VB.net VBA Assembler or the like and different activation methods merge modules activeX COM or the like to allow communication with the database s either locally installed on the computer or remotely installed or occurring across the Intranet and or Internet. As the database s of objects grows changes and or is updated or otherwise modified the existing software design tool programs typically become non operational produce errors and can stop functioning because the protocol to communicate with the database s must generally change. Very advantageously the communication module described herein solves these problems by providing a simple interface and concise method for the software design program to send data and or information to the database s and or to receive data and or information from the database s all without having to be reprogrammed or updated. Very advantageously the communication module translates the object attribute data into a protocol that the database s whether locally installed or remotely installed can understand. As the protocol between the database s changes the communication module can be updated and not cause any problems errors stop functioning become non operational and or the like with the existing CAD or other software design tool objects and software programming.

One example of the above is a scenario in which a CAD vendor A supports a library of windows including window code type XOX while a CAD vendor B on version 12 supports a partial library of windows wherein some of the windows are not supported and window code type XOX is excluded. The communication module described herein supports sending all of the library of the windows including window type XOX. If in the future CAD vendor B on version 13 supports the window code type XOX the communication module will not have to be upgraded because the window code type XOX is already supported in the communication module. This very advantageously allows one common database to be used for all of the different software design tool vendors programs and versions and such vendors can decide to support or not support all of the database objects in their current version while still allowing the vendor to change existing or future versions without having to change upgrade the communication module. Changing or upgrading the communication module is accomplished by using an installer program to remove the existing communications module version and installing a newer version or by incorporating the communication module in the installer that installs the software design tool program system on a user s computer.

The communication module preferably sits or is otherwise positioned between the software design tool program system and the database s . The communication module typically receives object attribute data from the software design tool program system receives requests to clear the communications module list of object data and receives requests to procure pricing data statements and or other information from the database s . When the communication module receives a request to procure such data and or information such as pricing data from the database s the communication module typically converts the data and or information into a communication protocol that the local or remote database s can process and sends the data and or information to the database s . The database s typically processes the request from the communication module and returns the data and or information back to the communication module in a data return communication protocol which generally includes the original data and or information and the additional requested data and or information pricing data and or the like . The communication module generally processes all the data and or information received from the database s translates the data and or information into a form that the software design tool program system can understand stores the data and or information at a location where the software design tool program system can access the data and notifies the software design program system that the data and or information has been received from the database s . The software design tool program system then generally retrieves the data and or information from the communications module and stores and or displays the data and or information inside the software design program system typically by either attaching the data and or information to the software design tool objects creating and or displaying an object schedule showing the pricing data and or information thus completing the cycle.

Very advantageously the communication module allows multiple software design tool vendors products programs versions to be supported while maintaining a single programming code with one or a plurality of master databases which is far superior in terms of ease efficiency flexibility and time to the traditional very time consuming and inefficient method of creating one special unique program code for each vendor product program and or version.

Additional future database objects can be supported within the communications module and thus the software design tool program systems as the communication module preferably includes an internal database update feature which allows the local and or remote database s to send new and or updated data and or information to the communication module and or update it without having to uninstall the existing communication module and install a newer more current communication module.

When a communication module is employed it is preferably employed installed and or activated in a manner described herein to translate the different ways that one or more software design tool programs are set up to export data which may readily be determined using methods known by those having ordinary skill in the art and may be achieved using a computer software download from the Internet or from a physical storage medium such as a CD DVD hard drive thumb drive tape drive and or the like to bring the add on computer software to the software design tool. As an example the communication module may send the attributes properties and translates them from the various CAD or other software design tool languages to one or a plurality of server protocols of height for example as P or using any other desired symbol . In this instance the communication module takes in this attribute as P from the CAD software program and subsequently changes translates height as P to height as P or to some other desired symbol prior to sending it to the database. Then it sends it to the database. When this is done a translation occurs. For instance every software design manufacturer or distributor can speak different languages as is discussed above or have data and or information stored in different ways so that the computer software design tool may speak for example x y or z and the server may speak for example E. The communication module will take in X and transmit the request into the server as E. When it receives the request back it sends X back to the software design tool program. This is extremely advantageous because only one data set is required to talk to all CAD or other software design tool platforms and the plug in computer code may not need to change for every CAD platform because the communication module can make the necessary changes or be programmed to make the changes as is explained above. The communication module will subsequently receive height as P back from the database along with data and or information and then change translate height as P to height as P prior to sending the height back to the CAD software to perform the routine such as inserting a price schedule into a plan drawing on a local computer. The advantage of the communication module which is very significant is that due to the foregoing translation that occurs there is no need to have a separate database for each CAD software company even though most CAD and other software design tool platforms speak and send data in different ways from one another as is discussed above. Also very advantageously if the method of sending or otherwise transmitting data and or information between the server database and the communication module changes as described above the CAD software program object parametric symbol is typically unaffected or may be changed by the user if needed or desired as described above.

The pricing information database s that are described herein may very advantageously be present on one or a plurality of local and or remote servers via an Intranet the Internet on one or a plurality of physical storage mediums such as CDs DVDs hard drives tape drives thumb drives and or the like on a network such as a LAN a WAN a MAN a CAN a SAN a VPN and or the like and or the like and updates to the data and or information present thereon may come from any or all of the foregoing periodically or upon demand of a user i.e. at any date and or time . The foregoing may have associate systems devices and or apparatuses for retrieving and or using such information such as CD players DVD players and or the like which are well known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

Very advantageously the systems and methods of the invention can be used with any object in CAD or other software design tool and with any CAD company and or product as is discussed above either with or without a communication module. Further different add on computer codes with similar methodologies work successfully with different CAD or other software design tool software programs. If for example plug in computer codes are changed for different CAD companies due to their programming as is discussed above and as a result of what is needed to make them perform the system and or method of the invention and they are attaching attributes properties and one or a plurality of identifiers for the purpose of sending to a database to retrieve information then the system and method is essentially the same.

Further and very advantageously the add on computer code can either run inside of a CAD or other software design program and or environment or outside of a CAD or other software design program and or environment. In one environment when the add on computer code is installed as is discussed herein it acts as if it is part of the software design program and a merge module can put or insert the computer add on code into the software design program. The merge module code operates as if it was compiled using the operating specific language.

Alternatively the add on computer code can run outside of the software design program operating as a dynamic link library DLL executable .exe ActiveX COM object or combination thereof or the like permitting a user to feel as though it is working inside of a computer software design program even though it is working outside of a computer software design program or platform.

See the section set forth hereinbelow regarding Interacting with the Wall Tool. The Symbol Palette of the desired object dragged and dropped from the symbol library See if one is present or employed may then be activated in a manner known by those having ordinary skill in the art. See the section set forth hereinbelow regarding Activation. 

In an embodiment of the invention in which one or a plurality of local and or remote databases containing pricing information is maintained on a remote server system such as an Internet web site for example the online 1stPricing web site a connection is preferably activated by the CAD or other software design tool user who has the plug in add on computer software installed within or outside of his architectural or other CAD program e.g. an Internet connection. For a first time user generally an architect builder or civil or industrial engineer accessing the remote server system database s a ZIP code may optionally be entered to obtain pricing information for construction or other products in connection with the construction or other project which may be obtained in connection with one two three four five or more different manufacturers distributors and or other individuals businesses organizations and or entities within the zip code or outside of the zip code nationally to procure the best price for one or a plurality of or each construction product within such zip code or nationally if a price of a product should not or will not vary much or at all between or among different zip codes respectively. In certain situations but not others which may readily be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art the price of one or more selected construction or other products windows doors acrylic glass blocks sky lights and or the like may or may not vary widely or at all with the geographical location region or area of the construction or other project. Alternatively such a price schedule can be generated without the use of a ZIP code.

In some cases pricing is national rather than regional or local and such pricing will not vary much or at all among or between different areas or regions of the country or other geographic areas i.e. the pricing will be the same or very similar for all regions . When pricing is national it is generally not necessary or desirable to use a zip code when generating a price for a construction plan or other element or price schedule. Velux skylights for example are typically the same price no matter where they are transported to or from because their manufacturer is a national company and does not vary its prices according to different regions or areas of or zip codes within the United States or elsewhere . Using the detailed information and illustrations that are provided herein those having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine whether or not a zip code is desirable or required in a particular situation and or region in connection with a procurement of pricing type of information.

Parametric symbols corresponding to construction plan or other elements are optionally but preferably employed in the systems and methods of the present invention and may be provided by the software design tool and or by the plug in computer software code. If one or more parametric symbols are employed a parametric symbol window door acrylic glass block sky light and or the like is clicked by a user and a symbol palette dialog box typically opens up with the various options attributes for the user to select. Data for the product options are entered by the user via drop down boxes check boxes or radio buttons or via direct data entry and then clicking OK. By clicking OK the user selects the options attributes for the parametric symbol and preferably inserts the resulting object into the construction plan. A parametric symbol becomes an object once the user attaches attributes to it and inserts it into the construction plan. Entry is then made of specific parameters that make up the parametric symbol such as color type of material size presence or absence of grids and the like. The parametric symbol is then optionally but preferably inserted into the construction or design plans for example into a wall of a kitchen of a house. From there the parameters of the parametric symbols can be modified as is necessary or desired. See the section set forth hereinbelow regarding Symbol Properties. The latter two steps can be repeated to establish the desired placement of the construction plan elements for the construction project into the construction plan drawings. Afterwards a price schedule may optionally be created. See the section set forth hereinbelow regarding Scheduler Creation Controls. 

Each of the parametric symbols employed by a user can be revised added deleted modified and or edited in any manner that is desired or as the construction or other project requires. A resulting price schedule can then be updated one or more times by the user as is necessary or desired and then may optionally be transmitted exported over an Intranet or Internet connection a LAN local area network or other network an external storage device or the like into one or a plurality of databases. Revised pricing data statements indications and or information can then be transmitted or sent back to the architectural CAD or other drawing which reflects new changes that have been made and optionally but preferably provides a price schedule Reference Number. This price schedule Reference Number can be entered into one or a plurality of databases by the user to retrieve pricing data and or information in connection with one or a plurality of selected construction plan or other elements and or parametric symbols corresponding to selected construction plan or other elements upon which the building products doors windows and or the like listed in a corresponding price schedule can advantageously then be immediately purchased or purchased on a subsequent date and or at a subsequent time. See the section set forth hereinbelow regarding Online Operations. Each time an object parametric symbol and or construction plan or other element is changed after the initial drawing has been priced the plug in add on computer software optionally but preferably reminds the plan drawer that plan pricing data and or information should be updated. Also the plug in add on computer software optionally but preferably pings the pricing database s periodically to see if any pricing data and or information has changed or if there is a new version of the plug in add on computer software and then asks the plan drawer to make appropriate updates.

Installation of the plug in add on computer software code component described herein permitting accessing of pricing data and or information for one or a plurality of construction plan or other elements and or in connection with one or a plurality of parametric symbols which a user may obtain from a CD ROM or other physical storage device or download from the 1stPricing or other website or otherwise on the same or other local or remote computer system and or console may be accomplished via a set of installation files in a manner known by those having ordinary skill in the art. These installation files may be part of the architectural CAD or other software design tool software installation program or may be accessed from a CD LAN WAN Intranet Internet or any other such medium or network. The installation procedure typically requires the running of a Setup.exe executable file preferably using standard Windows OS methodology although the invention can also be implemented using Mac Linux or any other such type of operating system. It is contemplated to include an opening advertisement popup to the architectural CAD software promoting the present invention. This popup could appear each time that the architectural CAD software is started. Selecting a checkbox that would be imbedded within the popup would deactivate it.

The plug in add on computer software code is a set of computer code that is designed to run within a parent computer software application or code particularly architectural CAD software or another architectural civil industrial or other software design tool as an internal component i.e. it adds on to the parent software application. Alternatively the plug in computer code may run outside of the software design tool operating as a dynamic link library executable .exe ActiveX COM object or combination thereof and or the like. Installation of the plug in add on computer software code optionally has an effect of placing parametric symbols files and associated data files onto a computer in which the plug in add on computer software code is installed. The parametric symbols in the parametric symbols files depict popular configurations of common products preferably construction elements such as different types of windows doors acrylic glass blocks sky lights cabinets fireplaces Forced Air Units drywall lumber insulation molding laminates plumbing fixtures electrical fixtures and the like. In a preferred embodiment three types of parametric symbols are provided 1 Windows 2 Doors and 3 Acrylic Glass Blocks. The installation of the plug in add on computer software code also optionally but preferably adds the following controls to the architectural CAD or other software 1 an activation button which is added to the main architectural CAD or other software toolbar as is shown in 2 a menu item labeled 1stPricing which is added in the architectural CAD or other software View menu and 3 a 1stPricing parametric symbol palette which is added to the architectural CAD or other software palettes.

The systems and methods of the present invention may optionally employ a palette of one or a plurality of parametric symbols that comes standard or otherwise with architectural civil industrial and or other computer software or that is provided by the plug in computer software code and enables the existing software design tool to transmit or bring back from one or a plurality of databases data and or information and can use an existing palette if necessary or desired. In the former situation the plug in computer software code enables existing functions in the architectural civil industrial and or other computer software to price and or pull in bring or transmit back information from one or a plurality of databases remote server systems and or the like. Alternatively no palette which is optional may be employed. The systems and methods of the present invention will work successfully as long as they have at least one identifier code as is discussed herein.

Computer software that is present on the remote server system or elsewhere such as on the online 1stPricing web site compares the information and or data that it receives from the user with a pricing database that is present at the remote server system or elsewhere to determine appropriate prices for the various construction or other products and for the particular characteristics parameters thereof that may optionally be represented by the parametric symbols. The computer software then returns the pricing information and or data preferably over the Internet preferably to the communication module and then to the user s local computer system . The plug in add on computer software code receives the pricing data and or information provided from the remote server or other system optionally generates a price schedule for the construction plan or other elements and optionally imbeds a price schedule including pricing data and or information directly into an architectural CAD or other software design tool drawing such as into a window that is present in a kitchen of a house.

As is shown in a Symbols Palette which optionally becomes present on the user s local or other computer and or console as a result of the plug in add on computer software code includes a set of controls and a list of one or more architectural or other parametric symbols. The controls are preferably divided into two groups 1 a toolbar and 2 scheduler controls. In the disclosed embodiment the parametric symbols are preferably organized into three groups or libraries 1 windows 2 doors and 3 acrylic glass blocks.

The Symbols Palette typically cannot be used until it is activated. Clicking the activation button or menu item that is present therein will generally launch activate the Symbols Palette. After installation of the plug in add on computer software the Symbols Palette can be launched by default. To activate the Symbols Palette an architect or other user may 1 click the 1stPricing activation or a similar type of button 2 select View 1stPricing or a similar menu item from the menu or 3 click the 1stPricing or a similar type of tab in the architectural CAD or other software design tool software palette.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention as is shown in the toolbar comprises four controls which include one drop down menu and three buttons and are as follows 

Optionally but preferably a set of one or more architectural or other parametric symbols or construction plan or other elements are provided by the plug in add on computer software code to represent a majority or more of possible options that are generally available to a user of the system of the present invention. Each parametric symbol or construction plan element typically has one or a plurality of unique aspects and or attributes parametric symbol values which optionally may be selected by a user prior to optionally inserting a parametric symbol or construction plan element into a construction plan drawing such as width height color depth thickness of glass and or texture and is typically a combination of two architectural CAD or other software design tool objects 1 a two dimensional representation of a construction element and 2 a three dimensional representation of a construction element as is shown respectively in . However the user does not need to select any parametric symbol values for any parametric symbols which values are optional because each parametric symbol or construction plan element will typically have pre set parametric symbol values which will generally be used unless the user selects different parametric symbol values as is discussed below. The parametric symbols and construction plan elements are designed to interact with an architectural CAD software Wall Tool or similar tool . After a user optionally selects one or more parametric values for one or more parametric symbols or construction plan elements the parametric symbols or construction plan elements are optionally but preferably inserted into the construction plan drawings by clicking on one or more of the parametric symbols or construction plan elements that are present in the list of parametric symbols that is present in the Symbols Palette and then moving dragging them into the architectural or other drawing such as a room of a house. A parametric symbol or construction plan element advantageously will typically automatically align itself with the orientation of a wall of a structure such as a house if applicable or with any other applicable location thereby showing the user a preview of the parametric symbol or construction plan element prior to placing the parametric symbol or construction plan element within the architectural drawing.

Before a parametric symbol or construction plan element is moved into the construction or other plans preferably a 1stPricing Symbol Properties palette or similar dialog automatically appears. This 1stPricing Symbol Properties palette dialog allows parametric symbol values such as color construction material size presence or absence of grids layout of grids number of grids type of glass and or the like for example in the case of a window 42 36 Standard Pattern Flat Grids and 5 Segment Bow or in the case of lumber 2 4 10 lumber to be optionally specified for each parametric symbol or construction plan element that is present in the Symbols Palette. Entry may be made by a user of specific parameters that make up the parametric symbol parametric symbol values by clicking on various available drop down menus and then selecting specific available parameters as is described herein.

Parametric symbol values can include any size or material specification for a given item such as a construction product window door acrylic glass block sky light and the like including a standard product item number for a respective construction element. In a new drawing as is shown in a User ID dialog preferably automatically appears when the first parametric symbol or construction plan element is inserted into the construction plans if a User ID has not yet been entered by the user. Further and very advantageously the 1stPricing Symbol Properties palette dialog or a similar dialog may optionally be recalled to edit one or more parametric values for any parametric symbol or construction plan element that has already been inserted into the construction plans. Selecting a parametric symbol and clicking the right button on a computer mouse will generally open a local menu. Selecting the 1stPricing Symbol Properties palette option from the local menu will generally open the 1stPricing Symbol Properties dialog for the parametric symbol.

Operation can be employed for example in the manner that is shown in . A user may click on the parametric symbol s or construction plan elements to be inserted into the construction plans and move drag the parametric symbol s or construction plan elements to a particular location in the construction plans where it is to be inserted such as a particular wall in a kitchen of a house and then release the button. The user may modify the parametric properties using the 1stPricing Symbol Properties palette or a similar type of dialog as is desired or necessary. When the parametric symbol or construction plan element is placed into the construction plans and modified as desired or required the user may click OK which typically causes the object to change to reflect the new parameters entered into to the palette.

Each type of parametric symbol corresponding to a product item such as a construction plan or other element windows doors acrylic glass blocks sky lights and the like generally has a unique set of parametric attributes properties that may be specified for each parametric symbol. In addition each specific parametric symbol generally has a unique range of values that is permissible for those parametric attributes. In some embodiments of the invention parametric symbol properties may only be edited by using the Properties Dialog or a similar type of a dialog . To edit the parametric symbol properties in these embodiments a user should select the parametric symbol to be modified and then click the right mouse button. The user should then select 1stPricing Properties from the local menu and modify the parametric symbol properties in the Properties Dialog as is necessary or desired. When the parametric symbol properties are modified as required or desired the user should then click OK. 

As is shown in General Properties are optionally available for all construction plan or other element and or parametric symbol types often herein collectively referred to as parametric symbols . The Parametric Controls or similar types of controls that are preferably available as General Properties are indicated as follows. The Symbol text box field allows the user to notate individual parametric symbols to put a text notation next to the parametric symbol object when it is optionally inserted into the construction plan . The notation will typically also be placed on an optional price schedule. The Location text box field allows the user to notate to insert a personal remark or notation the physical location of the parametric symbol in the set of construction plans e.g. master bedroom kitchen living room bathroom etc. . The Remarks text box field allows the user to make special notations about the parametric symbol such as Game room or Master Bedroom. The Distance off Floor text box field allows the user to specify a measurement value that specifies where the bottom of the parametric symbol is set in relation to a floor for example how far a bay window is off of the floor. Advantageously the plug in add on computer software code also optionally includes an implementation wherein upon insertion of a parametric symbol the implementation indicates whether or not the location of that parametric symbol meets the criteria of a Uniform Building Code UBC . The plug in add on computer software code generally knows the building codes for the various parametric symbols particularly once they are optionally inserted into the construction plan. It knows a window is a window and that building codes are associated with it. For example a window 2 feet from a door must generally be tempered. If a window is inserted less than 2 feet from a door the computer program would typically let the user know to temper it. As another example a 2 4 16 on center wall framing can generally only be used for the first two floors of a structure. Thus when a 3floor of a structure is drawn on top of a 2nd floor and the 1floor is 2 4 on center the computer program would typically let the user know that the 1floor must change to 2 6 16 on center.

The Properties Dialog preferably also contains three buttons that are preferably present for all parametric symbols and which preferably function as follows 

As is shown in Windows Properties are specific parametric attributes that pertain specifically to windows. Specific ranges options for windows may vary for each parametric symbol. As is discussed below there are optionally but preferably three Windows Properties classifications for windows 1 Window Details 2 Frame Details and 3 Options.

The Width drop down menus that are preferably located in the Symbols Palette are used to select width of windows in inches and in fractional inch increments.

Specific ranges options for acrylic glass blocks may vary for each parametric symbol. There are preferably three classifications for the acrylic glass blocks 1 Acrylic Glass Block details 2 Frame Details and 3 Options.

The Width drop down menu that is preferably located in the Symbols Palette is generally used to select width of the acrylic glass block in inches and in fractional inch increments. The Height drop down menu is generally used to select the height of the acrylic glass block in inches and fractional inch increments. The Handing drop down menu is generally used to select the handing right or left type of the acrylic glass block where applicable.

The Color drop down menu that is preferably located in the Symbols Palette is generally used to select the acrylic glass block frame color such as white black green blue or the like. The Material drop down menu is generally used to select the composition of the acrylic glass block frame such as vinyl wood aluminum fiberglass wood or clad.

The Pattern drop down menu that is preferably located in the Symbols Palette is generally used to select the acrylic block pattern such as diagonal patterns. The Color drop down menu is generally used to select the acrylic glass block color such as clear wave frosted wave green or blue. The Width drop down menu is generally used to select the acrylic glass block width such as 6 . The Thickness drop down menu is generally used to select the acrylic glass block thickness such as 2 .

As is shown in Door Properties are specific parametric attributes that pertain specifically to doors. Specific ranges options for doors may vary for each parametric symbol. There are preferably three classifications for doors 1 Door Details 2 Frame Details and 3 Options.

The Width drop down menu that is preferably located in the Symbols Palette is generally used to select width of a door in inches and in fractional inch increments such as 96 . The Height drop down menu is generally used to select the height of a door in inches and in fractional inch increments such as 96 . The Handing drop down menu is generally used to select the handing right or left of a door type where applicable such as for a 2 Panel Siding Door OX. OX means O is the stationary panel and X is the moving panel as viewed from outside of the door looking in.

The Glass Type drop down menu is generally used to select the desired door glass type such as clear Azurite Solar Grey Glue Chip or Obscured. The Low E drop down menu is generally used to select a Low Emissive Coating on the door glass. The Argon Gas check box is generally used to select Argon Gas filled door glass. The Tempered check box is generally used to select Tempered Glass for the door. The Breather Tubes check box is generally used to select breather tubes for the door.

As is shown in the Scheduler Controls optionally provided by the plug in add on computer software code are used to optionally create and maintain a price schedule that is generated using the parametric symbol data that is optionally contained in the construction plans. A price schedule is a detailed part list of the one or more parametric symbols and or construction plan elements that are optionally contained in the construction plans with appended pricing data. The pricing scheduler of the present invention typically use an Internet connection to access corresponding pricing data from one or more databases present on a remote server system such as a web site for example the online 1stPricing web site. However an Internet connection is not necessary and pricing data and or information may be accessed from one or more databases that are present on or in a physical storage medium such as a CD DVD hard drive disc drive tape drive and or the like or over a network or an Intranet. In some circumstances such as when a physical storage medium or network is not employed if no Internet connection is present an open price schedule and or green schedule may be generated but pricing data and green data will typically be absent. Only one piece of data is generally required for the pricing portion of the scheduler to work to procure price data that varies between different zip codes regions or areas which is a ZIP code for the location of the construction project. However when price data and or information does not vary between different zip codes regions or areas such as when a price is a national price i.e. it is the same or very similar regardless of location within the United States or another country the use of a zip code is not necessary. One control which is accessible from different paths in the pricing scheduler is preferably but optionally used to input this pricing data. If the user does not allow one or more parametric symbols and or construction plan elements to be priced no list of materials or corresponding pricing data will generally be provided. However the user can still draw the objects. 

As is described below and as is shown in three Pricing Scheduler Data Control buttons are preferably used to create and or update the price scheduler for accurate operation 1 Registration Button 2 Project ZIP Code Button and 3 1stPricing ID Button.

For new users clicking the Registration button generally opens up the optional Registration Dialog that is shown in . To first get to the Registration button the user can also click on the 1stPricing ID button or a similar type of a button . The user should then click a Click here to sign up for a 1stPricing ID link or similar link which generally opens up the Registration dialog box and complete the registration form that generally appears once the Registration Dialog is opened which registers the new user with the online 1stPricing web site maintained by 1stPricing or with a similar web site or registration tool . An active Internet connection may often be required for this to work properly but is not always necessary. The Registration Dialog preferably provides the following controls for entering data 1 a First Name text box preferably mandatory 2 a Last Name text box preferably mandatory 3 a Company Name text box 4 an Address text box 5 a City text box 6 a State drop down menu 7 a Postal Code text box 8 a Phone text box 9 a Fax text box 10 an Email text box preferably mandatory and 11 an Email me about updates and special offers check box. To Register the new user with 1stPricing or another entity the user clicks the Registration button fills out the registration form and then clicks OK. A new user confirmation notification is preferably subsequently sent to the new user electronically via an Intranet the Internet a LAN or other network etc. or physically U.S. or foreign mail facsimile etc. containing the user information. Such registration generally creates an online or other account at the 1stPricing web site maintained by 1stPricing or at some other desired location which can be used for placing orders for construction or other products reviewing orders and comparison shopping among a wide variety of different and possibly competing manufacturers and or distributors that market products within the zip code selected and or other third parties and or entities. This very advantageously allows a consumer to procure the most competitive pricing within a particular zip code or nationally for one or more construction or other products having a wide variety of desired characteristics for example a white vinyl clad double pane bay window having a specific height width and depth a specific number and type of grids a Low Emissive Coating on the glass and tempered and Argon gas filled glass as well as breather tubes.

The ZIP Code dialog provides two buttons 1 OK and 2 Skip. Selecting the OK button has the effect of entering the ZIP code into the pricing scheduler. Pressing Skip will cause ZIP code changes to be ignored and the user will be prompted that a correct ZIP code is required for accurate pricing. To properly set the project ZIP code the user should 1 click the Project ZIP Code button 2 then enter the correct ZIP code for the project location and 3 then click OK. 

Clicking the Project ZIP Code button preferably opens a ZIP Code dialog as is shown in . The ZIP Code dialog is optionally used to enter the physical zip code of the site of a construction or other project which is used to obtain an accurate price quotation for one or more construction or other products within that zip code that optionally correspond to one or more parametric symbols that have optionally been inserted into the set of construction or other plans. The ZIP Code dialog preferably provides two buttons 1 OK and 2 Skip. Selecting the OK button generally has the effect of entering the ZIP code into the pricing scheduler. Pressing Skip will generally cause ZIP code changes to be ignored and the user will generally be prompted that a correct ZIP code may be required for accurate pricing. To properly set the project ZIP code the user should 1 click the Project ZIP Code button 2 then enter the correct ZIP code for the project location and 3 then click OK. A zip code is not necessary if a user only desires to procure national or other regional pricing data and or information.

Clicking the 1stPricing ID Button or a similar button preferably opens a User ID or similar dialog as is shown in . This User ID dialog preferably provides a User ID text box field which generally enables a user to obtain a 1stPricingID or a similar type of an identification or ID . In order to have a 1stPricing ID generated and set a User ID the user preferably must first have filled out and submitted the Registration Dialog form or a similar type of a form as is described hereinabove. The User ID will typically initially be whatever the user specifies as a User Name on the Registration Dialog form. Clicking the OK button generally sets the User ID closes the dialog and provides the 1stPricing ID which is also typically the set User ID. The User ID and the 1stPricing ID are typically the same. The 1stPricing ID is typically a user ID name that the user has selected himself. He uses it along with a password to save pricing quotes. The user is then typically sent a user name and Password ID electronically via Intranet Internet e mail LAN or other network facsimile U.S. or foreign mail or the like. In contrast clicking the Cancel button generally closes the dialog. To set the User ID as indicated above and receive a 1stPricing ID the user generally clicks the 1stPricing ID button and after properly registering enters a User ID and then clicks OK. 

The parametric symbol Scheduler Creation controls that are shown in enable an optional creation updating and or viewing of a schedule of one or more selected parametric symbols and their characteristics which may include pricing data and or information as well as other types of data and or information. The Enable this Session check box generally allows the plug in add on computer software code to connect to one or more online 1stPricing web site or other designated web site databases and or offline databases containing pricing information preferably from at least one to up to about ten or more different manufacturers distributors or other third parties or entities for one or more or all parametric symbols and one or more or all parameters to obtain pricing information for selected parametric symbols and selected parameters often those that have been inserted into the set of construction plans . If this box is not checked the parametric symbol scheduler and user may not be able to access a database containing pricing data and or information and the parametric symbol schedule may possibly be generated without corresponding pricing data and or information. The Update and View Schedule buttons are preferably used once a plan has already been priced. Update will preferably generate a new price schedule and View Schedule generally takes the user to the existing price schedule.

If no optional parametric symbol schedule yet exists the user will preferably see a Create button which is preferably located in the Symbols Palette . Clicking on this Create button will preferably open a 1stPricing schedule dialog or a similar type of a dialog as is shown in which preferably includes a Generate and a Cancel button. This 1stPricing schedule dialog is generally used to generate a parametric symbol schedule that is based upon the parametric symbols and their corresponding characteristics that may optionally have been inserted into the construction plans and that may include pricing data and or information. This 1stPricing dialog also preferably prompts the user to input the size of font to be used in the parametric symbol schedule for ease of reading the schedule. The size of the parametric symbol schedule that is generated generally depends upon the font size used as well as upon the scale settings that are set by the plan drawer in architectural CAD or in another software design tool . Thus to create a parametric symbol schedule generally the Create button is clicked a schedule font height is typed in and the Generate button is clicked. A parametric symbol schedule will typically then be created which contains pricing date and possibly other types of data and or information. The programming of the optional communication module at the 1stPricing web site or 1stWindows web site or at similar types of web sites generally knows if a user is attempting to procure pricing information in connection with inserted or other parametric symbols and or construction plan elements i.e. this can be determined from tags that are put into the code when it comes from the plan drawer or other user . The parametric symbol schedule including a pricing schedule or the like can then optionally be inserted directly into the construction plans by the plug in add on computer software code.

If on the other hand a parametric symbol schedule already exists the user will preferably see a different button on the Symbols Palette that is preferably labeled Update instead of Create as well as a button preferably labeled Export Schedule. Using the Update button will generally have the effect of changing the parametric symbol or construction plan element schedule according to parametric symbol or construction plan element changes that may have been made by the user since the creation of the parametric symbol schedule for example to change the selected size of a window or since its last update. In all other respects this procedure preferably is generally the same as using the Create button. If the user clicks the Export Schedule button the user is then preferably asked the file format of the database that the user intends to use Excel Plain Text Word PDF and or the like and where to save the parametric symbol schedule file on the user s computer.

When an optional parametric symbol schedule is generated all of the schedule information is preferably saved at the online 1stPricing or other designated web site and can be accessed by the user using the plans 1Pricing Reference Number generated by the plug in add on computer software code. When a user session is enabled and there is an open Internet or other connection a Reference Number is preferably appended to the parametric symbol schedule. Preferably this number can be used to retrieve the parametric symbol schedule at the online 1stPricing or other designated web site.

Some construction or other products may not be available in an area designated by a ZIP code that is entered by a user. In such an instance pricing is not always listed for all of the parametric symbols that are inserted into the construction plans and a N A not applicable or similar designation is preferably placed into the optional parametric symbol or price schedule in place of a price.

Clicking a View Schedule or similar type of a button on the Symbols Palette will typically zoom to the part of the architectural CAD or other software design tool drawing of the construction plans where the optional parametric symbol or pricing and or green schedule has been inserted. If one or more parametric symbols have been altered without updating the parametric symbol or pricing and or green schedule a message will preferably be appended to the schedule that reads the same as or similar to the following Schedule may not reflect the window specifications. If windows are not involved the message will preferably refer to the particular type of parametric symbols objects and or construction plan elements that are involved such as doors acrylic glass blocks cabinets drywall and or the like. 

In a resulting price schedule that is shown in unique parametric symbols and or construction plan elements such as windows doors skylights cabinets acrylic block and or the like are preferably listed vertically. Details characteristics for one or more or each parametric symbol and or construction plan element are preferably organized horizontally under the following or similar types of columns Symbol Location Width Height Handing Color Type Material Grid Style Low E Argon Gas Tempered Breather Tubes Glass Glazing Remarks Quantity and Pricing from at least one Manufacturer or Distributor or other third party or entity .

Very advantageously as a result of the plug in add on computer software code the architectural parametric symbols and or construction plan elements can optionally be made by the user to auto imbed into one or more wall depictions that have been created with the architectural CAD or other software design tool computer program particularly its Wall Tool as is shown in the two dimensional and three dimensional depictions that are present in . A parametric symbol and or construction plan element can optionally be moved from the Symbols Pallet into a selected wall for example into a wall in a master bedroom of a house or into a wall in an office of a commercial building. To insert a parametric symbol and or construction plan element into a particular wall the particular parametric symbol is preferably dragged and dropped to the desired wall location and then entry is preferably made of the specific parameters that make up the parametric symbol and or construction plan element into the construction plans at the site of the desired wall.
