With the development of new technologies medical images and or records are increasingly created and stored electronically. Electronic medical images and records data are in certain instances reviewed by medical personnel on a picture archiving and communication systems PACS which are computers and or networks dedicated to the storage retrieval distribution and presentation of medical images and records. Generally the medical images and records data are stored in an independent format wherein the most common format for storing medical images and in some cases medical records is DICOM Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine .

In certain PACS there is software and or hardware that prevents doctors from viewing multiple electronic files containing medical images and records wherein the electronic files are associated with different patient identification numbers. Such patient identification numbers also known as a medical record numbers MRN are generally stored in the header portion of the medical images and or records files. This is generally a safety mechanism that prevents medical professionals from comparing data from two different patients. This mechanism operates effectively when each patient possesses one identification number.

In certain instances patients have multiple identification numbers because patients often visit multiple hospitals or other medical facilities. For example patients move from one locality to another or patients seek second opinions from doctors at different medical facilities or patients visit different doctors specializing in different medical fields as patients move through various stages of life or treatment. Generally each doctor and or medical facility has a unique patient identification numbering scheme or system.

Accordingly a patient s medical images and or records at one facility are associated with one patient identification number whereas the same patient s medical images and or records at another facility are associated with a different patient identification number. Therefore PACS that have the safety mechanism described above prevent medical professionals from conducting a side by side review of the medical images and or records associated with different identification numbers even though the images and or records correspond to the same patient. A medical professional using a PACS in conjunction with the methods systems and devices described herein can conduct a side by side review of the medical images and or records associated with different identification numbers provided however that the images and or records correspond to the same patient.

In one embodiment medical facilities are equipped with a system that allows each facility to transfer medical files from a source medical facility to a destination medical facility.

On the request form the medical professional provides patient information related to the patient and medical facility information related to both the destination and source medical facilities. For example the patient information may comprise but is not limited to the patient s name the patient s identification number at the destination medical facility the patient s identification number at the source medical facility the patient s age sex disease type address date of birth social security number or the like. The medical facility information may comprise but is not limited to the name of the medical facility identification number of the medical facility the location of the medical facility the division or branch office of the medical facility the telephone number of the medical facility or the like. In one embodiment the PACS RIS HIS and or other local hospital systems can comprise the same functionality as the film librarian interface such that the PACS HIS and or other local hospital systems can be configured to automatically generate a request for medical files wherein the request is sent to the main server system an application programming interface API . For example a doctor reviewing medical files on a PACS can in context meaning while reviewing medical files for a particular patient generate a request for related medical files that are available at other medical facilities by using the interface of the PACS. In certain embodiments the generated request from PACS RIS HIS and or other local hospital systems can submitted transmitted and or communicated through a http or https connection or URL request message internet connection wireless connection to the main server the client server system and or the film librarian interface system. In certain embodiments the generated request from the PACS RIS HIS and or other local hospital systems can be transmitted communicated and or submitted through a messaging protocol for example HL7 over any kind of network.

The web interface sends the patient information and the medical facility information to the main server wherein the main server system determines where the request should be sent. After identifying the appropriate medical facility the source medical facility to send the request the main server system at block sends the request to the film librarian interface corresponding to the source medical facility.

In a preferred embodiment the film librarian or other medical personnel at block reviews the request on the film librarian interface and attempts to locate and match the patient name and source patient identification number provided in the request form. In certain circumstances the medical professional searches a PACS a RIS a HIS or the like to locate medical files associated with the information provided in the request form. In certain embodiments the system semi automatically and or automatically conducts a search and or matches the patient name and source patient identification number provided in the request form and or searches a PACS a RIS a HIS or the like to locate medical files associated with the information provided in the request form. In certain embodiments the system presents or causes to display match information for example exact and or near matches to the film librarian for review and or approval and or selection. The medical professional then determines whether the source medical facility possesses medical files corresponding to the provided patient information.

If the medical professional locates and matches the provided patient information with medical files at the source medical facility the medical professional approves the request form by interacting with the film librarian interface. The film librarian interface sends the approval communication as well as the matching information to the main server at block . The matching information can comprise but is not limited to the patient identification number assigned by the source medical facility and or names or other identifications to locate the requested medical files. At block the main server system then instructs the client server system at the source medical facility to send transmit or transfer the appropriate medical record files to the client server system located at the destination medical facility. At block the main server system also instructs the client server system located at the destination medical facility to receive access accept or retrieve the appropriate medical files from the client server system at the source medical facility.

In other embodiments the main server system stores or saves the matching information for future use. For example if a future request is received by the main server system and the request comprises substantially the same or similar patient information and or medical files examinations and or MRN s the main server system can be configured to automatically match and or locate the requested medical files based on the previously saved matching information and or user configurable matching criteria and or other algorithm. For example the main server system can be configured to build over time a knowledge database of matching patient identification numbers MRN s locations of medical files examinations or the like. In certain embodiments the knowledge database is generated or updated periodically or in real time based on data mining of the Transaction History Database or by querying various attached and or connected client server systems at medical facilities. Using the knowledge database the main server system can be configured to send transfer or cause to display a listing of all or substantially all the medical files examinations at all or substantially all the medical facilities equipped with a client server system. For example for a specific patient identification number used by one medical facility the main server system can be configured to generate a listing of all known patient identification numbers assigned to the patient at other medical facilities and generate a listing of all or substantially all known medical files examinations available at the various medical facilities. In certain embodiments the knowledge database is generated from data received and or stored in the client server system. In other embodiments the main server system is configured to generate the listing information by retrieving the patient information from the multiple client server systems in real time or periodically based on a batching process.

In other embodiments the locating and matching is performed automatically by the main server system or the client server system and not by a medical personnel operating through a film librarian interface. In this embodiment the main server system is configured to send a request for medical files to the client server system at the source medical facility. The client server system automatically attempts to match and or locate the medical files associated with the patient information provided in the request form via user configurable matching criteria and or other algorithm. In searching for the medical files the client server system connects to the medical facility s PACS image server RIS HIS or other database system where patient medical files are stored.

If a match that satisfies a minimal threshold is found then the request form is approved automatically by the client server system and or may be presented displayed to the film librarian for approval and a communication is sent back to the main server. The main server system then instructs the client server system at the source medical facility to send the appropriate medical record files to the client server system located at the destination medical facility. The main server system also instructs the client server system located at the destination medical facility to receive the appropriate medical files from the client server system at the source medical facility.

To track medical files received at a destination medical facility accession numbers are created for each medical file received. The accession number not only tracks the medical file within a medical facility but also an accession number is used to link related portions of a medical file that are related but stored in different databases. For example an accession number can link a medical image stored in the image database with a corresponding doctor s report that is stored in a RIS and or HIS system because the same accession number has been stored in the header portion of both medical image file and the doctor s report file.

In one embodiment after the medical file has been transferred from the source medical facility to the destination medical facility the client server system directly creates an accession number in the RIS and or HIS and or PACS systems at the destination medical facility wherein the accession number relates to the medical files that have been received. In other embodiments the accession number is created before the medical files have been transferred but after the client server has instructed by the main server system to receive medical files from another medical facility.

In one embodiment the process of creating an accession number occurs directly between the client server system and the RIS and or HIS and or PACS system when the client server system has full and open access to the RIS and or HIS and or PACS systems. Where the client server system does not have full and open access to the RIS and or HIS and or PACS system the client server system in certain embodiments is configured to create an Order Message ORM or equivalent message or the like that is sent to the RIS and or HIS and or PACS systems which causes the RIS and or HIS and or PACS systems to create an accession number for the medical files that were received and returns the accession number to the client server system.

In the HL7 Standard an ORM message is any request for materials for example 500 ml of 2.5 saline or services for example a range of motion study an EKG a lipid panel and the like . Orders are usually for a particular patient. The transmission of clinical orders occurs between the application placing the order the placer and the clinical application filling the order the filler . Accordingly the placer in this embodiment is the client server system at the destination medical facility and the filler is the RIS and or the HIS system at the medical facility.

The client server system at the destination medical facility is configured to modify the header portion of the medical files to ensure that the medical files are compatible with the patient identification numbering system and the other systems at the destination medical facility. In certain embodiments the client server system modifies the header portion of the medical files by removing modifying substituting or adding the patient identification number that corresponds to the source medical facility and inserts modifies substitutes or adds the patient identification number utilized by the destination medical facility.

In certain embodiments the client server obtains the patient identification number from the RIS and HIS systems associated with the destination medical facility. In some embodiments the client server obtains the patient identification number from the main server system. In certain embodiments the main server system provides this information while instructing the client server system at the destination medical facility to receive retrieve access or accept medical files from the source medical facility. In other embodiments the client server system at the source medical facility modifies the header portion of the medical files to comprise the patient identification number provided by the destination medical facility wherein such modification at source medical facility can occur prior to the transfer of the medical file from the source to the destination medical facility.

In some instances the destination medical facility provides the patient identification number directly to the source medical facility. In other instances the patient identification number is provided to the source medical facility by the main server system. In other instances the client server system at the source medical facility is configured to transfer a raw medical data file without a header portion wherein the client server system at the destination medical facility is configured to add a header portion comprising information compatible with the PACS and other systems of the destination medical facility.

In certain embodiments the client server system at the destination medical facility is configured to confirm the medical files into a format that is compatible for the PACS and other systems at the destination medical facility. For example the client server system is configured to convert a DICOM medical image file into a JPEG medical file. Alternatively the client server system may convert a DICOM medical image file with the image compressed in JPEG2000 to a format compatible with the target PACS or other system such as a DICOM image compressed in standard JPEG.

The client server system and or the remote server system is configured to store the received medical files and or examinations in the PACS image server RIS and or HIS systems at the destination medical facility. A medical professional can then retrieve and view the medical files from the PACS RIS and or HIS systems at the destination medical facility. In certain embodiments a user at the destination medical facility can view medical files obtained from the source medical facility side by side with the medical files from the destination medical facility. In certain embodiments the client server system is configured to also store the received medical files in a patient data database within the client server system to enable medical professionals to retrieve and or review medical files and or examinations directly from the client server system without retrieving the information from the PACS image server RIS and or HIS systems. The client server system can be configured to store the medical files and or examinations indefinitely or for a temporary period of time for example minutes hours days months or years. In certain embodiments the client server system can be configured to control store and or remove medical files and or examinations based on a policy that can be fixed and or amended.

In one embodiment the client server system comprises a transaction history database for tracking the transfer history of medical files. For example the client server system is configured to record in the transfer history database the transfer of every or substantially every medical file that is transferred in and or out of its medical facility and such information is known as transaction history information as defined above. In certain embodiments the transaction history information is associated and or is assigned a unique identifier in a lookup table or the like so that the foregoing information can be recalled based on the unique identifier. The unique identifier or a reference tag is then embedded or written or stored in the header of the medical file to a form an audit trail thereby allowing medical professionals or others to later determine the origins of the file.

In certain embodiments the client server system is configured to decipher or interpret at least a part of the foregoing unique identifiers. For example the client server system can identify the medical facility that created the unique identifier. Based on that information the client server system and or a medical professional can search or request to have searched the transfer history database of the medical facility that created the unique identifier to obtain the transfer history information associated with the medical file.

Instead of storing a unique identifier in the header portion of a medical file in another embodiment the transaction history information itself is written or added into the header portion of the medical file as text or in another data format every time or substantially every time the medical file is transferred from one medical facility to another thereby creating an audit trail. If transaction history information is in text the transaction history information can be written with or without tags for example XML HTML and the like . In certain embodiments the PACS or other system is configured to allow a medical professional to review and analyze the transaction history information stored in the header portion of the medical file using a header viewer system.

In other embodiments the client server system is configured to analyze interpret normalize and or filter the transaction history information in the header portion of a medical file and directly store the information in RIS and or HIS systems when the client server system has direct and open access to the RIS and or HIS systems. In other embodiments where the client server system does not have open and direct access to the RIS and or HIS system the client server system creates an Observation Results Message OBX or equivalent message system communication or the like comprising the transaction history information and an accession number and sends the OBX message or equivalent message system communication or the like to the RIS and or HIS systems which accepts and processes and stores the message. Normalizing as used herein can comprise but is not limited to a method or system of analyzing the data extracting certain recognized data elements and assigning those data elements to a particular related data field used by the system.

In other embodiments the transaction history information is transferred in the data portion of a medical file instead of the header portion of a medical file. The transaction history information can be stored as text in the data portion of the medical file with or without tags for example XML HTML and the like or the transaction history information can be stored as an image in the data portion of the medical file. If stored as an image file then the client server system is configured to modify the header portion of this medical file as disclosed herein and store the medical file in the PACS and or image server.

In certain embodiments the PACS and or other systems are configured to allow a medical professional to review and analyze the transaction history information stored in the data portion of the medical file as a normal medical image or record file. PACS and or other systems can also be configured to compare and or review the transaction history information as an image with other medical files because the patient identification numbers do not conflict and or are the same after the client server system inserts overwrites amendments adds and or modifies the correct patient identification number to the header portion of the medical files.

In any transfer of medical files and or examinations there may be multiple series of medical files images reports and or examinations in the set. For example a set may include without limitation a series of scout views a series of brain window images a set of bone window images and or the like. In certain embodiments a transaction history information summary image may appear with separate series and or set. For example as illustrated in a transaction history information summary image can be displayed at the beginning the end and or at any other point of each series. In other embodiments the transaction history summary images may appear at the beginning end and or at any other point in the set. In other embodiments the client server system is configured to analyze interpret filter the transaction history information in the data portion of a medical file normalize the transaction history information and store the normalized transaction history information in RIS and or HIS systems at either a destination or source medical facility.

If the transaction history information is stored as text in the data portion of a medical file then the client server system is configured to analyze interpret normalize and or filter the transaction history information in the data portion of a medical file and directly store the information in RIS and or HIS systems when the client server system has direct and open access to the RIS and or HIS systems. In certain embodiments the storing of the transaction history information in the RIS and or HIS systems occurs by inserting the information into specific related entry fields when the client server system has open and or complete access to the RIS and or HIS systems.

In other embodiments where the client server system does not have open and direct access to the RIS and or HIS system the client server system creates an OBX message or equivalent message system communication or the like comprising the transaction history information and an accession number and sends the OBX message or equivalent message system communication or the like to the RIS and or HIS systems which accept and process and stores the message. Normalizing as used herein can comprise but is not limited to a method or system of analyzing the data extracting certain recognized data elements and assigning those data elements to a particular related data field used by the system. and or the RIS HIS systems as a medical file. The OBX or equivalent message system communication or the like can comprise at least the patient identification number used by the destination medical facility the accession number and the transaction history information and the name of the medical file associated with the transaction history information.

In the HL7 Standard an OBX is a message used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. One mission of an OBX is to carry information about observations and results. Sometimes the OBX segment is found as a part of an order message ORM or RDE . In this case the OBX carries clinical information needed by the receiving system. For example an OBX is needed to report the menstrual phase information which should and or could be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. The OBX message or segment can be used to contain encapsulated data for example a PDF document a CDA document or a DICOM image or any of the MIME Multimedia Internet Mail Extension support formats such as JPEG GIF FAX and the like. If the actual observation value is not sent in an OBX but exists somewhere else the OBX message or segment can contain a reference pointer. The reference pointer can be a hyperlink which the receiving system would use to access the observation information document or image. The OBX segment can be used to transmit patient clinical information in a variety of formats.

In other embodiments the client server system is configured to transfer the transactional history information by electronic mail after receiving instructions from the main server system.

Transaction history information differs generally from medical history information as is defined above. In certain embodiments the medical history information is transferred from one medical facility to another in the data portion as opposed to the header portion of a medical file using the various transfer methodologies described herein. The client server system at a destination medical facility is configured to receive to the medical file comprising the medical history information. In some instances the medical history information is stored as text with or without tags for example XML HTML and the like however the medical history information can also be stored as an image.

If the medical history information is stored as text then the client server system at the destination medical facility is configured to analyze interpret normalize and or filter the medical file comprising the medical history information and or directly store the medical history information into the RIS and or the HIS system located at the destination medical facility. In certain embodiments the storing of the medical history information in the RIS and or HIS systems directly occurs by inserting the information into specific related entry fields when the client server system has open and or complete access to the RIS and or HIS systems.

If the client server system does not have open and or complete access to the RIS and or HIS systems the client server system in some instances is configured to create OBX and or equivalent message or system communication or the like comprising the medical history information and sends the OBX and or equivalent message or system communication or the like to the RIS and or HIS systems such that the medical history information can be stored in the RIS and or HIS systems at the destination medical facility. The OBX and or equivalent message or system communication or the like can comprise at least the patient identification number used by the destination medical facility the accession number and the medical history information.

If the medical history information is stored as an image then the client server in certain embodiments stores the image in the PACS and or image server or RIS or HIS assuming the target system can accept image data. The client server system is configured to modify the header portion of the medical file that comprises the medical history information by inserting or adding to the header portion the patient identification number used by the destination medical facility. In certain embodiments the client server system is configured to directly store the modified medical file comprising the medical history information in the PACS and or image server. In other embodiments the client server system is configured to directly store the modified medical file in RIS and or HIS systems where the client server system has direct and or full access to those systems. If the client server system does not have direct and or full access to those systems then the client server system creates an OBX or equivalent message system communication or the like that can comprise the image and sends the message to the PACS RIS and or HIS systems for processing and storage. Medical professionals with access can use PACS RIS and or HIS systems thereafter to view the medical file side by side with other medical files for that patient stored at the medical facility because the patient identification numbers stored in the header of the medical files do not conflict and or are the same.

In the foregoing embodiment the medical history information can also be inserted into the header portion of the medical file instead of the data portion of a medical file. The client server system at a destination medical facility is configured to receive to the medical file comprising the medical history information in the header portion of the medical file. In some instances the medical history information is stored as text with or without tags for example XML HTML and the like . In certain embodiments the client server system at the destination medical facility is configured to analyze interpret normalize and or filter the header portion comprising the medical history information and or directly stores the medical history information into the RIS and or the HIS systems located at the destination medical facility where the client server system has direct and or full access to those systems. If the client server system does not have direct and or full access to those systems then client server system creates an OBX or equivalent message system communication or the like that comprises the medical history information and sends the message to the RIS and or HIS systems for processing and storage.

In other embodiments the client server system is configured to transfer the medical history information by electronic mail after receiving instructions from the main server system.

Concurrently or sequentially at block patient completes and submits a HIPAA release form. A patient can use a kiosk system or other user access point at the destination medical facility or at some other location completes and or submits a HIPAA release form for allowing the requested medical files to be released. In certain embodiments there is a unique bar code on the HIPAA release form to uniquely identify the HIPAA release form or to associate the HIPAA release form to a particular patient. In certain embodiments this HIPAA release form may be computer generated and downloadable from the internet or in other embodiments may be printed by the kiosk. As disclosed herein the kiosk system or a hospital medical facility workstation attached and or electronically connected to the client server system can accept a paper form completed by the patient. After accepting the HIPAA release form the kiosk can scan and or OCR the paper form into a PDF TIFF or other document image file format at block and identify the bar code or other information on the form. In certain embodiments the bar code is already associated with the patient in which case the kiosk can associate the scanned paper form with the correct patient and transfer the scanned paper form to the main server system for storage in the HIPAA release form database. In certain embodiments the bar code is not already associated with the patient in which case the kiosk system instructs that the user input identification information name contact information username and or identification code or the like and kiosk system verifies the information with the main server system. If the patient information is verified then the kiosk system associates the patient identity for example the main server system s unique identifier the patient identification at the source medical facility the patient identification at the destination medical facility or the like .

Alternatively at block the HIPAA release form can be faxed to an electronic facsimile fax system or other computer system that can digitize and process the fax. At block the fax system can have OCR integrated into the system so that the fax system can read interpret and or decipher the bar code on the HIPAA release form thereby allowing the fax system to automatically associate the faxed HIPAA release form with the proper patient and or request.

Alternatively the kiosk system can allow the patient to complete the form electronically via the interface on the kiosk system. In certain embodiments the kiosk system is configured to comprise a signature pad wherein the patient can write or input his signature to be electronically stored in a database at the kiosk system or in the main server system or in the client server system at a medical facility or printed on to a HIPAA release form. To verify the identity of the patient the signature can be compared to prior signatures on file by the main server system or by the film librarian. The kiosk can also comprise a webcam or other video photo input device for capturing a video or photographic image of the patient using the kiosk.

With reference to an example of the medical procedure mapping module is depicted in the main server system. The medical procedure mapping module can be used to map translate or rename the code and or name of a medical procedure performed at a first medical facility into the procedure code and or name used by a second medical facility . As illustrated in Medical Facility has performed scan of Patient and the procedure name for the scan is CT Abd Pelvis w IV Contrast which means Patient had a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis areas with IV contrast added. Patient has authorized Medical Facility to access his scan however Medical Facility has a different patient identification number for the patient and uses a different name for the medical procedure that was performed for example Abd Pelvis CT w .

Accordingly and still with reference to the code and or procedure name of the scan can be changed within the header portion of the patient file for purposes of ensuring that the file is compatible with the medical systems at Medical Facility enabling medical professionals at Medical Facility to determine the contents of the medical file conforming the file name to the consistent naming standard of Medical Facility ensuring the association of the proper billing codes and or medical reimbursement codes to the medical file or the like. The remapping or renaming protocol can be a one to one mapping or a many to one mapping or one to many mapping. For example a one to one mapping is where each code and or name of a medical procedure is mapped to one specific code and or name. In contrast a many to one mapping is where several codes and or names of medical procedures are mapped to one specific code and or name.

In certain embodiments the system is configured to map medical procedure codes and or names at destination and or source medical facilities to a standardized mapping table and or a standardized intermediary code system. By using a standardized mapping table and or a standardized intermediary code system the complexity of maintaining separate mappings for each institution can be reduced. The original procedure name and or code may in certain embodiments be stored in a DICOM tag or private DICOM tag in the header and or displayed as in a summary image saved stored embedded or burned into the image set. In certain embodiments the medical procedure mapping module automatically maps translates and or renames the source procedure code and or name to the code and or name of the medical procedures used at the destination medical facility possibly through the standardized intermediary code system described above and stores the data in the PACS RIS and or HIS systems at the destination medical facility.

Regarding in certain embodiments the medical procedure mapping module is located at the medical facility in the client server system . After receiving the medical file from Medical Facility the client server system at Medical Facility processes the header portion of the medical file using the medical procedure mapping module. The medical procedure mapping module identifies the CT Abd Pelvis W IV Contrast code and or name of a medical procedure performed Medical Facility and maps translates and or renames it to the code and or name of the corresponding medical procedure performed Medical Facility which in this example is Abd Pelvis CT . In the foregoing example a one to one mapping is used wherein medical procedure codes and or names at one medical facility map directly to medical procedure codes and or names at another medical facility.

Referring to alternatively the medical procedure mapping module located at the source medical facility in this example Medical Facility can be configured to use the medical procedure mapping module to map translate and or rename the medical procedures to the corresponding codes and or names in a standardized mapping table and or standardized intermediary code system stored at the main server system . The standardized mapping table and or standardized intermediary code system can be accessed in the main server in real time or a copy of the standardized mapping table and or standardized intermediary code system can be transferred distributed or pushed out periodically to the client server systems so that the information can be accessed locally and without accessing the main server . The mapped translated and or renamed the medical procedure having the standardized nomenclature can be transferred to the destination medical facility for example Medical Facility or . The client server system at the destination medical facility medical for example Medical Facility or can use the procedure mapping module and the standardized mapping table to map translate and or rename the medical procedure having the standardized nomenclature to the codes and or names used by the destination medical facility. In the foregoing example medical procedure codes and or names at one medical facility are mapped first to a standardized mapping schema or table and then the standardized mapping codes and or names are mapped to the multiple medical procedure codes and or names at other medical facilities

Referring to the medical procedure mapping module can also be configured to allow a medical professional with the appropriate authorization and or system privileges to manually review analyze approve override set and or identify the code and or name of the medical procedure to be associated with the medical file. The setting chosen by the medical professional can be temporary for example a special code or name for the medical file or can be stored for similar medical files received in the future. As such the medical procedure mapping module can be configured to remember and or save the setting manually performed or selected by the medical professional so that similar medical files received in the future will automatically be associated with the code and or name of the medical procedure. Accordingly the medical procedure mapping module can learn over time the proper codes and or names to be associated with certain medical files or build a mapping table over time. Alternatively the medical procedure mapping module can be configured with a mapping table during the initial setup or during periodic updating of the client server system and or the main server system.
