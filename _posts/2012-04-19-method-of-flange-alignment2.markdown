title: Method of flange alignment
abstract: A method of aligning flanges on two components to align and transfer torque from one component to the other uses a plurality of scallop regions on the periphery of a flange on one component; and a plurality of raised regions on the periphery of a flange on the other component, the raised regions being sized and shaped to engage the scallop regions on the flange when axially aligned to transfer torque there between.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 06 C 0081 awarded by the US Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

When two v band flanges are assembled together such as the flange of a starter assembled to a gearbox their relative clocking position is typically controlled using a pin in one flange and a hole in the other flange. The addition of a pin to one flange is performed by drilling a hole normal to the face of the flange and installing a pin. This pin is pressed into the flange and is retained by an interference fit with the flange. This interference fit results in tensile stresses in the flange which can reduce the life of the flange in high vibratory environments.

For example flange to flange mating of starters to gearboxes of gas turbine engines is important because the starter imparts a high degree of vibration and torque especially when the starter is hydraulic. Efforts to use pins and holes have not been found to survive high torque and vibration during use such as with starter motors and gearboxes. The flanges mate but because of stresses in the flanges and or because of the pin or the hole flanges may not survive adequately for operational use.

The present invention is capable of mating the flanges of two components such as starter motors to gearboxes and function under high vibration and torque without failure thus making the use of high performance starter motors commercially viable. The flanges are clocked relative to each other by forming a plurality of scallop shaped cut outs on the periphery of one flange and a matching plurality of raised regions or bosses on the periphery of the other flange. The cut out area and the raised regions mate to provide alignment of the flanges and to transfer torque without adversely affecting either flange.

The specific shape of the scalloped or cut out regions on the flange depends upon the amount of flange metal available and the size and shape of the bosses or raised regions. If the cut out regions are first configured then the raised regions are designed to engage them. Conversely if the raised regions are formed first the cut out regions will be designed to engage them. Both the scallops and the raised regions may be formed by any normal method. Machining them has been effective.

Gearbox has flange that is to engage a similar flange on starter motor shown more clearly in with clamp removed. Gearbox flange has a plurality of scallop areas . In one embodiment the scallop areas extend from an edge to an interior of the flange and are spaced apart by 90 around a periphery of the flange . Starter motor has a plurality of raised regions around a periphery of the flange that are formed to fit in scallop areas again spaced apart by 90 . As is clear in the scallop areas and raised regions mate in such a manner that when flanges and are axially aligned i.e. the raised regions are in an interference fit with the scallop areas they transfer torque from starter motor to gearbox during operation of the components.

Both flanges and are structurally sound because there is no internal stress caused by holes drilled or pins driven into them. The present invention accomplishes the junction of the gas turbine engine components using the least amount of metal thus keeping the weight as low as possible. Alternative proposed efforts such as using larger diameters with pins and holes or making the flanges thicker are less effective due to weight concerns as well as less effective alignment of the gas turbine engine components.

The term scallop region is defined as an area on the flange that has been removed such as by machining and is not limited to any specific shape. The shape can be round as shown in the drawings but it can also be V shaped triangular rectangular or square. All that is required to be a scallop region is that a portion of the flange has been removed to provide a surface into which a portion of the other mating flange can fit.

The term raised region or boss is defined as a region on one flange that protrudes or extends out in alignment with a scallop region of the other flange. Raised regions can be formed by machining the rest of the flange face or by other methods such as casting or extruding a region to fulfill that function.

In raised region is shown as being thicker at the radially inward ends i.e. raised region is generally heel shaped and scallop is similarly thicker radially inward. In this embodiment the mating of the scallop and raised region is made stronger allowing even more torque to be transmitted effectively. Also shown in is flange with both scallops and raised regions . Having both scallops and raised regions on flange and on flange provides double mating and torque transmitting capability. The raised region is on a radially extending tooth of flange . Also shown in are scallop region and boss or raised region being rounded at the inward edge and extend out to the outer or circumferential end of flange . The side surfaces of raised region contact the side surfaces of scallop region .

The size and shape of scallops and raised regions is determined by the amount of torque the two parts will experience in use as well as by the amount of material that flanges and have. The mating flanges should have as little weight as possible while being strong enough to transfer the torque as described above.

While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment s it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment s disclosed but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
