This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 601 160 filed Feb. 21 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a braking system and in particular to a trailer braking system for use with a fifth wheel hitch a gooseneck hitch or the like having a surge brake actuator.

Gooseneck hitches use a hitch ball to lock into place while fifth wheel hitches use a wheel shaped mounted plate to accomplish the connection.

Unlike regular hitches that generally extend from the back of the tow vehicle to couple to a horizontally mounted hitch coupler provided on the trailer gooseneck hitches and the closely related fifth wheel hitches are typically anchored to a hitch on the tow vehicle via a fixed arm member extending downward from an upper portion of the gooseneck trailer. These hitching systems enable the trailers to be able to make tighter turns than the ones that connect off the back of the tow vehicle.

When a fifth wheel or gooseneck trailer is being towed behind a vehicle and the tow vehicle applies its brakes or otherwise decelerates the trailer may continue to travel forward due to forward momentum of the trailer. This forward momentum causes inertial forces that can damage the hitch the tow vehicle and or the trailer.

Methods and apparatuses for a braking system having a surge brake actuator are described herein according to various embodiments of the present invention.

According to one or more embodiments a braking system for a trailer pulled by a tow vehicle is described. The braking system may include an arm member extending downward from and pivotally connected to an upper portion of the trailer and a surge brake actuator connected to the upper portion of the trailer that is configured to control braking of wheels of the trailer. When the tow vehicle decelerates inertial force caused by forward momentum of the trailer pivots the arm member such that force is exerted on the surge brake actuator.

According to one or more embodiments a method for braking a trailer pulled by a tow vehicle is described in which the trailer has a braking system including an arm member extending downward from and pivotally connected to an upper portion of the trailer and a surge brake actuator connected to the upper portion of the trailer that is configured to control braking of wheels of the trailer. The method may include decelerating the tow vehicle. When the tow vehicle decelerates inertial force caused by forward momentum of the trailer pivots the arm member and force is exerted on the surge brake actuator.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to a braking system having a surge brake actuator. The braking system may provide a connection between the trailer and the tow vehicle via a fifth wheel hitch a gooseneck hitch or the like in some instances.

The trailer braking system may include an arm member extending downward from and pivotally connected to an upper portion of the trailer and a surge brake actuator coupled to the upper portion of the trailer that is configured to control braking of the trailer. When the tow vehicle decelerates inertial force caused by forward momentum of the trailer pivots the arm member such that force is exerted on the surge brake actuator. In some embodiments the surge brake actuator may include a master cylinder assembly that is configured to output fluid pressure to the trailer wheel brakes which is substantially proportional to the rate of deceleration of the tow vehicle and the mass of the trailer.

In operation when tow vehicle service applies its brakes or otherwise decelerates the forward momentum of the trailer causes force to be exerted to the surge brake actuator though pivotal motion of the arm member. This in turn causes braking of the trailer wheels. The arm member which is coupled to hitch of the tow vehicle may also transmit the deceleration force of the tow vehicle to the surge brake actuator.

The trailer generally includes a bed wheels and a pair of jack stands . The bed may be configured for the particular application load or both of the trailer. A closed bed compartment is shown although it should be appreciated that the trailer bed may be fully open partially open or generally flat as known in the art. In addition the bed may further include one or more doors windows vents ramps lifts tail gate and or the like. The trailer may have a frame construction including rails struts and or beams with side wall or rails. The various frame members may be coupled together by welding with fasteners e.g. bolts or the like.

The trailer is equipped with wheel brakes for causing rotation of the trailer wheels to slow down or stop altogether. The wheel brakes may be a part of a hydraulic braking system having braking elements such as for example conventional hydraulic drum or disc brakes. When fluid pressure is applied to the wheel brakes the wheel brakes apply a clamping force to the trailer wheels to slow or stop rotation of the trailer wheels . Other types or trailer wheel brakes might also be provided in other embodiments.

The trailer includes an arm member that is pivotally connected to an upper portion of the trailer. The arm member may extend substantially vertically downward from the upper portion of the trailer . Pivoting of the arm member controls braking of the trailer when the tow vehicle resists forward motion such as when the tow vehicle decelerates. The greater the pivoting of the arm member the greater the force applied to the surge brake actuator to variably control braking of the trailer wheels . On the other hand when little to no fluid pressure is applied to the trailer wheel brakes no clamping force will be applied to the trailer wheels and the wheels can rotate freely and the arm member may be at a generally vertical i.e. 90 degree position relative to the ground.

The upper end of the arm member depends from an upper portion of the trailer while its lower end includes a hitch coupler that is configured to releaseably couple with a hitch attached to the tow vehicle such as a ball hitch a fifth wheel hitch or the like. The tow vehicle may be a conventional tow vehicle having a hitch mounted thereto. If the tow vehicle is a pick up truck the hitch may be mounted in its bed similar as shown in for example.

The trailer may be adapted to transport a specific object such as car boat all terrain vehicle ATV motorcycle tractor farm equipment construction machinery materials e.g. lumber pipe beams etc. animals such as horses cows livestock etc. or the like for example. Moreover the trailer may be integrated with or otherwise included with another object such as a camper recreational vehicle RV mobile command center or the like pulled by a tow vehicle. In one embodiment the trailer may be 34 feet long insulated carpeted inside and having a drop ceiling an electrical system e.g. 100 amp. 3 phase electrical system a reinforced walking roof and guard rails. The trailer may also be equipped with air conditioning work benches power cords and connectors control systems and other amenities as desired.

The surge brake actuator may be a relatively simple hydraulic brake system from both an operational and installation perspective. As shown the surge brake actuator generally includes a body a mounting plate a push rod a master cylinder assembly and a fluid reservoir .

The push rod is configured to slide in a direction D inwardly and outwardly relative to the housing . A coupling may be provided at the external end of the push rod for coupling with an element e.g. an arm member or a lever arm of the trailer braking system via a pivotal connection such as a pivot pin.

One or more mounting holes in the mounting plate allow the surge brake actuator to be mounted to a frame of the upper portion of the trailer by welding with fasteners e.g. bolts or the like. A flexible removable seal may be positioned between push rod and the mounting plate to prevent dirt and debris from entering the housing . And one or more bushings or bearings not shown may also be provided to help reduce or suppress friction between moving parts.

The master cylinder assembly generally includes a slideable piston and cylinder having a variable volume in fluid connection with the braking system of the trailer via a port . Movement of the push rod causes movement of the piston to increase or decrease the volume of the cylinder . The port allows fluid to flow between the master cylinder assembly and the trailer wheel brakes for instance via a fluid conduit not shown to control the trailer wheel brakes. For hydraulic wheel brakes movement of the piston generates a corresponding hydraulic fluid pressure in the braking system. In particular when the push rod slides inwardly i.e. to the left in the cylinder volume of the master cylinder assembly compresses thereby increasing the fluid pressure output to the trailer wheel brakes. Conversely when the push rod slides outwardly i.e. to the right in the cylinder volume of the master cylinder assembly expands thereby decreasing the fluid pressure provided to the trailer wheel brakes.

The master cylinder assembly may be configured to control output of fluid pressure to the trailer wheel brakes. The fluid pressure output may be substantially proportional to the rate of deceleration of the tow vehicle and the mass of the trailer for example.

As shown the push rod may be directly connected to or coupled with the piston of the master cylinder assembly . Although it will be appreciated that the push rod might also be coupled to the piston of the master cylinder in other ways such as for example via a pulley linkage lever pitman gear or the like to transfer movement and force there between. In some embodiments the surge brake actuator might further include a spring to bias the push rod in one direction e.g. outwardly a shock absorber configured to dampen sudden movement such as jolts that the surge brake actuator may experience or both.

The fluid reservoir stores fluid and is fluidly connected to the master cylinder assembly . Excess hydraulic fluid may be stored here when not being provided to the trailer wheel brakes.

In some instances a commercially available actuator may be modified for use with one or more braking system embodiments of the present invention. For example the surge brake actuator may be a modified DEMCO Model DA10 actuator available from Dethmers Manufacturing Co. Boyden Iowa . The Model DA10 actuator has a maximum load rating of about 12 500 lbs. GWVR and 1 000 lbs. load limit. Basic modification of the Model DA10 actuator may include removing the conventional hitch coupler and sliding frame element and adding a push rod to the assembly and adapting the mounting plate for attachment to the upper portion of a trailer in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Further modifications may be necessary for various applications as desired. By using a commercially available actuator its safety and operational features may also be implemented in the trailer braking systems of the present invention.

The trailer braking system generally includes an arm member a pivot pin a hitch coupler a motion resistance assembly and a surge brake actuator .

As shown the trailer braking system may be included with and or integrated in an upper portion of a trailer which is to be pulled by a tow vehicle. The upper portion may include a frame construction including rails struts and or beams with side wall or rails. The various frame members may be coupled together by welding with fasteners e.g. bolts or the like. Here for example the upper portion of the trailer may include a top member and side members one shown . Additional or fewer frame members might be provided and the construction of the trailer may be different from what is shown.

The arm member may be an elongated element that includes an upper end and a lower end which pivotally connects to the upper portion of the trailer. The arm member may be solid hollow or partially hollow depending on weight and or strength requirements. In some embodiments the arm member may have a circular cross section although other cross sectional shapes may also be possible.

The upper end of the arm member extends downward from and is pivotally connected to the upper portion of the trailer by the pivot pin . The pivot pin may be supported by side members on at least one of its ends. This allows the arm member to be supported by the pivot pin between at least one of the side members and to pivot. To reduce friction at the pivot point a bushing or a bearing device can support the pivot pin with respect to the upper portion of the trailer the arm member or both. Alternatively the arm member could also be pivotally connected to the upper portion by a hinge clevis ball and socket joint or the like which enables pivotal movement there between.

The lower end of the arm member extends downward and outward from the upper portion of the trailer and is adapted to couple to the tow vehicle. The lower end may include a hitch coupler that is configured to releaseably couple to a hitch that is mounted to a plate on the tow vehicle. The hitch may be a hitch ball fifth wheel plate or the like.

The motion resistance assembly is configured to resist motion and or stabilize sudden motion such as jolts . The motion resistance assembly may include a moveable portion and a stationary body portion . The motion resistance assembly may include a spring a shock absorber or both. The spring may be an automotive coil spring and the shock absorber may be a heavy duty automotive shock absorber for example. The moveable portion of the motion resistance assembly contacts the arm member . For instance the moveable portion may simply be capable of being in touching contact with the arm member for transferring motion or force although in some embodiments the moveable portion could be coupled to the arm member via a pivot connection to accomplish that purpose.

When there is no relative motion or differential forces between the trailer and the tow vehicle the spring of the motion resistance assembly is configured to urge the pivotally arm member to be held in a generally vertical position to prevent undue motion between the trailer and the tow vehicle.

The surge brake actuator is configured to control braking of the trailer wheels. In various embodiments the surge brake actuator may be configured as the surge brake actuator shown in . Here the push rod of the surge brake actuator pivotally couples with the arm member via a pin member . The surge brake actuator may include a master cylinder assembly which controls fluid flow to the trailer wheel brakes. Movement of the push rod may cause similar movement of the master cylinder assembly . Fluid flows between the master cylinder assembly and trailer wheel brakes for instance via a fluid conduit not shown to control the trailer braking system.

When the tow vehicle decelerates the inertial force caused by forward momentum of the trailer urges the upper portion of the trailer to move forward relative to the tow vehicle. This inertial force pivots the arm member in a rotational direction C such that the push rod is urged toward the body of the surge brake actuator and force is exerted on the surge brake actuator . The master cylinder assembly in turn outputs fluid to the trailer wheel brakes for braking the wheels of the trailer. The greater the pivoting of the arm member the greater the force applied to the surge brake actuator to control braking of the trailer. The brake actuator may be pivotally mounted to the upper portion of the trailer to accommodate the arc direction C.

Under resistance to forward motion of the trailer the spring of the motion resistance assembly is compressed with the application of force to the surge brake actuator . When force is removed from the surge brake actuator the spring of the motion resistance assembly urges the arm member back to the vertical position. The maximum extent of pivotal movement of the arm member in the direction opposite to direction C past the vertical position may be limited for example using a stop block bar detent or other motion limiting device.

The motion resistance assembly and the surge brake actuator may be mounted to the upper portion of the trailer for example by welding with fasteners e.g. bolts or the like. For instance a mounting plate e.g. mounting plate may be provided for this purpose.

In the motion resistance assembly is shown in a position closer to the pivotally connected upper end of the arm member than the surge brake actuator . However it should be appreciated that in other embodiments this arrangement could be reversed with the surge brake actuator being in a position closer to the pivotally connected upper end of the arm member than the motion resistance assembly .

Various elements of trailer braking system may be similarly configured as trailer braking system and thus will not be further described in great detail here unless otherwise described below . In particular in trailer braking system an arm member a pivot pin a hitch coupler a motion resistance assembly and a surge brake actuator may be similarly configured as the arm member the pivot pin the hitch coupler the motion resistance assembly and the surge brake actuator respectively of trailer braking system . In addition trailer upper portion may be similarly configured as trailer upper portion .

However unlike in the braking system illustrated in where the motion resistance assembly and the surge brake actuator directly couple with the arm member the trailer braking system illustrated in further includes a lever arm coupled to the motion resistance assembly and the surge brake actuator .

The lever arm may be an elongated element that includes an upper end and a lower end . The upper end of the lever arm pivotally connects to the moveable portion of the motion resistance assembly and or the push rod of the surge brake actuator with a pivot pin . The lower end of the lever arm pivotally connects to the upper portion of the trailer with a pivot pin . Here the lower end of the lever arm pivotally connects to the upper portion of the trailer. However it should be appreciated that the upper end of the lever arm might be pivotally connected to upper portion of the trailer or to another element instead in other embodiments.

A contact element may be further provided on the arm member or the lever arm to contact the other of the arm member or the lever arm . Here the contact element is shown provided on the lever arm for contacting the arm member . The arm member or the lever arm which is provided with the contact member may further include a plurality of predetermined locations for select placement of the contact element . For example as shown in the lever arm is provided with a plurality of placement locations for the contact member . The contact member may simply be capable of being in touching contact with the arm member although in some embodiments the contact element could be coupled to the arm member and the lever arm via a pivotal connection such as a pivot pin.

Movement of the arm member causes pivotal movement of the lever arm via the contact member . The contact element may be coupled to the arm member or the lever arm using a bolt a clamp a releasable pin or the like.

The lever arm enables more precise adjustment to be made for better braking action of the trailer and may further increase mechanical advantage and or lower stresses on certain elements in various embodiments. For example the placement of the contact member relative to the other elements allows for adjustments to be made for optimal braking action of the trailer. As shown the plurality of placement locations may be holes. However slots recesses clamping locations or the like might also be used for the same purpose. One or more additional lever arms may be further provided to increase mechanical advantage and or lower stresses on elements in various embodiments also.

Various elements of trailer braking system may be similarly configured as trailer braking system and thus will not be further described in great detail here unless otherwise described below . In particular in trailer braking system an arm member a pivot pin a hitch coupler a motion resistance assembly and a surge brake actuator may be similarly configured as the arm member the pivot pin the hitch coupler the motion resistance assembly and the surge brake actuator respectively of trailer braking system . In addition trailer upper portion may be similarly configured as trailer upper portion .

The trailer braking system further provides an additional safety feature for engaging the trailer wheel brakes when the trailer is not hitched to the tow vehicle. The trailer braking system may further include a rod member which translates with respect to the arm member . For example the rod member may be configured to slide within the confines of the arm member as shown or configured to slide fully or partially externally from the arm member . The rod member may be an elongated element and may have a shape size or both that generally correspond to the arm member in some embodiments.

As shown the rod member may include a cam surface that engages a corresponding follower element coupled to the external end of the push rod of the surge brake actuator . The follower element may include a pivot pin that slides in a track or slot of the rod member defining the cam surface for instance.

The cam surface and follower element are configured to selectively enable braking action of the trailer braking system by sliding movement of the rod member . As the rod member translates with respect to the arm member the cam surface causes the follower element to slide thereto. This action controls sliding movement of the push rod of the surge brake actuator independently of pivotal motion of the arm member .

In some embodiments as shown the cam surface may have a generally U or V profile with an inwardly indented bottom surface and outwardly ramping surfaces. For instance when the rod member is in a first position i.e. not coupled to the hitch of the tow vehicle the ramped surface of the cam surface of the rod member engages the follower element so as to push or urge the push rod of the surge brake actuator inward. This results in large pressure being output by the master cylinder assembly and therefore a large pressure being initially applied to the trailer wheel brakes. This pressure can fully clamp the wheel brakes of the trailer.

Conversely when the rod member is in a second position i.e. coupled to the hitch of the tow vehicle as shown in the inwardly indented bottom surface of the cam surface engages follower element so as to draw or pull the push rod of the surge brake actuator outward. This results in little to no pressure being output by the master cylinder assembly and therefore little to no pressure being initially applied to the trailer wheel brakes. Additional force can be exerted on the surge brake actuator and in turn to the trailer wheel brakes when the arm member pivots similar to the trailer braking system .

A spring may be positioned between the rod member and the arm member to bias the rod member toward the hitch of the tow vehicle i.e. in the first position . The spring may be a 400 lb. coil spring for example in one embodiment. The spring may cause the surge brake actuator to be applied by default to engage the trailer wheel brakes to prevent the trailer wheel from rolling when the trailer is not coupled to the hitch of the tow vehicle.

In addition a releasable pin may be provided for locking the position of the rod member with respect to the arm member . For example after the arm member couples to the hitch of the tow vehicle i.e. urging the rod member into the second position the pin can be inserted into corresponding holes in the arm member and rod member to lock the rod member in that position. The pin member may be a cotter pin bolt bayonet coupling or the like for example. The safety feature of trailer braking system may be incorporated into various embodiments of the present invention.

Elements of the various trailer braking systems described herein may be fabricated from any suitable materials such as steel aluminum wood or the like.

As should also be appreciated no special modifications or added equipment is generally needed to be installed on the tow vehicle to couple with a trailer equipped with a trailer braking system in accordance with various embodiments. Thus almost any properly sized powered tow vehicle having a suitable hitch can be used to pull the trailer equipped with the trailer braking system.

The foregoing description for purpose of explanation has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the present disclosure and its practical applications to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as may be suited to the particular use contemplated.

While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.
