title: System and method to impose activity limitations on a user with biometrical enforcement
abstract: A system and method are disclosed by which, in one embodiment, a user of a user terminal may select or be subject to one or more imposed limitations on their activities over a period of time. The commitment and data corresponding to an identifying biometric feature of the user are stored. When the user uses a user terminal the system and method compares a capture biometrical image of the user with the stored image and if there is a match the one or more limitations is/are enforced. Biometrical data for files where the temporal period of the limitation has passed are ignored to reduce the number of files with which the comparison must be made reducing the number of false matches.

This application is a continuation application of pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12 842 373 filed Jul. 7 2010 and titled A System and Method for a Player to Commit to Limitations with Biometrical Enforcement .

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to systems and methods by which limitations on an activity may be enforced through biometric identification. More particularly it relates to a system and method where player may place limitations on their gaming activity and which includes the capturing of biometrical data for enforcement of such limitations.

Gaming is a highly regulated business. Some gaming jurisdictions have identified problem gambling as an issue which suggests a commercial response. One response has been to set monetary daily limits for players. For example it has been known for riverboat gaming to limit player s to a bankroll the amount the player can wager with of a certain amount each day. Another technique has been for regulators the gaming venue or the player themselves to exclude the player from play. Such exclusions rely to a great extent on vigilant casino personnel. Such exclusion programs have shortcomings such as that an excluded player can circumvent the exclusion by evading venue security or using a disguise or can simply travel to another venue where the exclusion does not apply.

Where a player voluntarily seeks to exclude or limit their gaming activity enforcement may be implemented additionally through the venue s player loyalty system. Player loyalty systems are well known such as the Bally CMS system sold by Bally Technologies Inc. of Las Vegas Nev. These loyalty systems include player registry where vital information is given by the player and a player account is established in the system. The player is given a magnetic stripe card encoded with information so the system can tie the card to the player s account. When the player plays a gaming device or table game they present their loyalty card. At a gaming machine the card is presented by the player inserting their card in a card reader. The data is read and the system account is accessed. Players use their loyalty cards to receive comps such as money back meals lodging or the like provided by the casino.

Where a player self excludes i.e. voluntarily places limitations on his her gaming activity presentment of the loyalty card alerts personnel to the presence of the excluded player who can then take steps to seek enforcement of the exclusion.

Self exclusion can be evaded by the player avoiding casino personnel and not presenting their player loyalty card. Further the player can simply travel to another gaming venue where he she has not self excluded or has not enrolled in a loyalty system.

Regarding player loyalty systems it has been known that such systems can be used across several gaming venues. Boushy U.S. Pat. No. 7 419 427 issued Sep. 2 2008 and titled NATIONAL CUSTOMER RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference discloses an example of such as system.

It has been suggested that passive biometric identification be used in a gaming environment to identify players and undesirables . Cumbers U.S. Pat. No. 7 175 528 issued Feb. 13 2007 titled PASSIVE BIOMETRIC CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION AND TRACKING SYSTEM the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference discloses an example of such a system. The system disclosed in this reference suggests the use by a player of a personal identification number PIN to reduce the number of files against which the biometric sample must be compared as well as culling stale data related to players who do not meet play frequency requirements.

A drawback to prior self exclusion programs is that as discussed above an action is required by the player such as presentment of their loyalty card. A player wishing to evade the exclusion can simply not use a card or use a companion s card. Additionally the player who is self excluded at one venue can go to another nearby venue.

A drawback to using passive biometric identification is that as the number of records grows the probability of returning a false positive i.e. an incorrect match increases. As one might imagine a large casino in Las Vegas with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year will quickly be servicing a record of perhaps a million or more files. Where there are affiliated properties such as the casino properties owned and operated by MGM Resorts International in Las Vegas alone the number of files would quickly exceed several millions of files.

Regarding biometric identification as the biometric data file inventory grows so does the false acceptance rate FAR . In a work titled INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY Simon Foley department of Computer Science University of College Cork Nov. 21 2008 http www.cs.ucc.ie kieran cs3090 pdf lecture14 security.pdf it was postulated that where the FAR is 0.000001 a 50 chance of a false match would occur regarding fingerprint records when the number of files reaches 1000.

There is a need for a system and method where a user can commit to behavioral limitations or such limitations can be imposed by others such as in gaming and where the limitations can be enforced using biometric identification. In gaming the limitations may be in regards to losses wins amount wagered time or the like. There is a need for a player to able to self exclude without the use of a loyalty card. There is a need for a system and method for a player to place limitations including exclusion which can be enforced through the passive gathering of biometric data and which reduces the chances of obtaining false matches. There is a need for a system and method which can use biometric data enforcement across multiple venues such as venues in close geographic proximity.

Accordingly there is set forth according to the present invention a system and method by which a person may self impose limitations on their activities for a selected duration and where passively captured biometrical data is used to enforce those limitations. In the gaming environment the present invention is directed to a system and method where a player may self impose limitations on their gaming activity for a selected temporal period and where passively captured biometrical data of the player is used to enforce said limitations.

Toward this end a system and method is set forth for enforcing a commitment to restrict activity by a user. The commitment may be self imposed by the user or may be imposed by others such as a responsible family member a governmental agency or by a business. The commitment may relate to gaming activities shopping activities consumption activities such as alcohol consumption or other activities. The system and method includes a device for capturing data corresponding to a biometric feature of the user at a location associated with said activity. The device may be one or more of a digital camera for capturing an aspect of the user s face retina scanner iris scanner finger print reader and biological activity sensor such as a device to sense the heartbeat rhythm patterns or a user s infrared heat signature or any other device for passively capturing biometric identification information from the user. The location associated with the activity may be a computer terminal gaming machine cash register or bar for example. A processor and a data structure are provided as well as an apparatus for the user or other to input their commitment into the data structure as well as a selected temporal duration period such as for example 24 hours. As but an example the user may input a commitment to limit his gaming losses to 100 in a 24 hour period. This commitment is associated with the user s captured biometric data. When the user attempts to engage in the activity subject to the restriction commitment their biometric data is passively captured by the data capturing device. The processor is configured to a disregard at least said biometric data from said data structure when said corresponding duration period has lapsed and b if said biometric data matches stored biometric data in said data structure enforce said commitment. By disregarding data where the commitment temporal period duration has expired the number of comparison files in the data structure is reduced thereby reducing the chances of obtaining a false or failing to detect a match. The commitment may be enforced by notifying the user of their commitment third parties e.g. store or casino personnel to assist the user in enforcing the commitment or by disabling a device associated with the activity.

There is also set forth a system and method for enforcing gaming limitation criteria related to play of gaming devices which includes a device for generating data corresponding to a biometric feature of players of the gaming device. This device may be one or more of a digital camera fingerprint scanner retina or iris scanner or other device suitable for passively capturing biometric information which can be used to identify the player. A processor is provided in communication with said data generating device and with an apparatus for a player or other to enter data corresponding to limitation criteria related to the player s play of a gaming device the limitation having a defined temporal retention period. For example the player may input data corresponding to a limitation criteria that he she wishes to limit the amount of money wagered to 500 over a 48 hour period. A data structure in communication with the processor stores the limitation criteria and retention period data in association with a corresponding player biometric identification data. When the player seeks to engage in gaming activity at a gaming device the data generating device captures the player s biometrical information and the processor is configured to a disregard at least said biometric data from said data structure when said corresponding retention periods have expired and b if said biometric information matches stored biometric data in said data structure enforce said limitation criteria upon the player. The processor may disregard the biometrical data by expunging the biometric information data from the data structure when the retention period has expired. Enforcement of the commitment where indicated may include issuing a message to the player and or disabling the gaming device.

There is also set forth a system and method for enforcing gaming limitation criteria for multiple venues each including one or more gaming devices. In this fashion a player may impose the limitation across several gaming venues such as commonly owned managed casinos or casinos within a geographic area. The system and method includes a device for generating data corresponding to a biometric feature of players of the gaming devices. As stated above the device may be one or more of a digital camera for capturing an aspect of the user s face retina or iris scanner fingerprint reader biological activity sensor such as a device to sense the heartbeat rhythm patterns or a player s infrared heat signature or any other device for passively capturing biometric identification data from the player. A processor is in communication with apparatus associated with said gaming devices for a player or other to enter data corresponding to limitation criteria the limitation criteria having a defined temporal retention period. A data structure stores the limitation criteria data in association with a corresponding player biometrical data. When a player desires to play a gaming device the biometric data capturing device passively captures the biometric information of the player which is communicated to the processor. The processor is configured to a disregard at least the biometrical data in the data structure when the corresponding retention periods have expired and b if said generated biometrical data matches stored biometrical data in said data structure enforce said limitation criteria upon the player. By disregarding data where the commitment duration has expired the number of comparison files in the data structure is reduced thereby reducing the chances of obtaining a false or failing to detect a match. Where the limitation period has expired preferably at least the associated biometric data is expunged from the data structure.

Where the gaming venue employs a player loyalty program the self limitation program may be incorporated into the system such as for example enabling the player to re invoke limitation criteria used for example on prior visits.

The limitation criteria in a gaming context may be entered for example at a data input device at the gaming machine such as a touch screen device. The processor may be configured to upon request by the player display the player s prior limitation criteria the status of their active limitation criteria or suggested limitation templates for the player to select. Enforcement includes disabling of the gaming machine.

Other features and numerous advantages of the various embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description when viewed in conjunction with the corresponding drawings.

Disposed at the gaming device is a device for passively capturing biometric information data from a player. In the preferred embodiment this device is a digital camera located and focused to obtain a digital image of the face of a player. Alternatively the device may be a fingerprint reader located for example in button or touch screen . Other examples of such devices include retina or iris scanners infrared detectors voice detectors biological system sensors such as heart rhythm pattern detectors or other devices configured to passively obtain a biometric sample of the player sufficient to identify the player and digitize the same. For purposes of the description of the preferred embodiment the invention will be described where the device is the digital camera for capturing a facial feature image of a player for purposes of identification.

The data corresponding to the digital image captured by the camera is provided to a local data server which includes a data memory structure configured to store data corresponding to biometrical information data as well as limitation data. For example as described below when a player establishes a commitment to limit their gaming activities the player s biometrical data and limitation data are stored at the data structure preferably in the form of a data file. The gaming device is located at a venue such as a casino club or store. What is meant by a local server is a situation where the server is geographically associated with the venue hosting the gaming device . Where the system and method of the present invention is configured to apply to multiple venues the local server is in communicates through a network such as the Internet or a dedicated LAN or WAN with a host server which may be located at a remote location. Other venues would likewise have their local servers in communication with the host server in a similar manner. The data stored at the local servers is shared with the host server whose data structure stores biometrical and commitment data from all venues.

Turning to and the gaming device hardware for their controller s is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. The hardware includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player system interface devices over buses . Gaming voucher ticket printer for printing player cash out tickets is connected to PIB and GMU over buses . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over buses .

For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to the game input output board of the EGM processing board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming device to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming device cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming device by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via a player interface such as the button panel . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle button such as a SPIN RESET button touch screen icon or depressing button . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more of the main and or secondary displays . In some embodiments the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming device for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the main secondary display s .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server.

The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to a player card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus player system interface display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive system interface display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server described above.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

In an alternative embodiment the player system interface including the display may instead be presented upon command or request by the player as a portion of the main display . Where the main display has touch screen functionality upon command or request the content at the main game display such as a video reel game display is sized to accommodate a player interface display panel at the main game display in a manner as suggested in . The touch screen functionality for the main game display is configured to enable the player to interface with the interface through touch screen controls buttons sliders arrows etc. .

Turning to is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of high level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

Progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming device events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

A credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations.

During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module where a coin token hopper is provided must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

In various embodiments any of the gaming devices may be a mechanical reel spinning slot machine video slot machine video poker machine video bingo machine keno machine or a gaming device offering one or more of the above described games including an interactive wheel feature. Alternately gaming devices may provide a game with an accumulation style feature game as one of a set of multiple primary games selected for play by a random number generator as described above. A gaming system of the type described above also allows a plurality of games in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention to be linked under the control of a group game server not shown for cooperative or competitive play in a particular area carousel casino or between casinos located in geographically separate areas. For example one or more examples of group games under control of a group game server are disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 938 079 entitled Networked System and Method for Group Gaming filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Turning to the operation of the system of the present invention will now be described. illustrates the operation where a player initially establishes a commitment to a limitation to their gaming activities. With particular reference to at the gaming device and system are both placed in an active state. At the gaming device is in an idle mode awaiting a player. When a player sits down in front of the gaming device the camera passively captures the player s facial image. The camera may be prompted by a motion sensor not shown or by the player inserting money or a voucher to establish credits on the gaming device . Alternatively the camera may be programmed or controlled to capture images are regular intervals. Other triggers for the capture of the player s facial image can be used.

The image captured by the cameral is digitized and transmitted though a communication network such as bus to the local server such as biometric server . At the local server a processor compares the image to the images stored in the server s data structure and at determines if there is a match i.e. if the player can be identified. If the player cannot be identified at the local server issues a signal to the gaming device or alternative the signal is sent to the network services server which issues the signal to cause an interface at the gaming device to present an offer for the player to voluntarily select to commit to a gaming limitation. The interface with the player may be through the system interface such as a Bally iView device and its display . The limitations a player may register for include one or more of i play time ii maximum losses iii number of consecutive days of gaming iv net win amount v net loss amount vi number of plays or the like.

With reference to the presentment of the offer to commit to a limitation instead of presentations at the system interface the system may control the EGM to display a panel or a window defined at the main game display . In the example shown in the player interface presents an example of a dashboard from which the player can select a configuration for their self limitation by selecting from categories of MAXIMUM PLAY TIME MAXIMUM LOSS MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS PLAYED. Touch screen buttons are defined at the main game display as well as RESET SAVE and CANCEL touch screen buttons. The player makes their selection such as for example selecting to voluntarily limit their play time to 4 hours. This selection is saved at one or more server memory data structures and is associated with the captured biometric information data from the digital camera . This association may be by a tag or by creating a file. Where the player has enrolled in the venue s casino player tracking program and is using their loyalty card the data can be saved associated with the player s account. The player s account may store the player s prior commitment templates for future presentation to the player. For example when a player returns to the venue the system may recall the player s last expired commitment for display to the player so that the player may opt to impose the same limitation s .

Returning to in addition to any self imposed limitations the venue or jurisdiction may have required pre commitment limitations that apply regardless of a player s voluntary commitment such as for example a player cannot lose more than 200 day. If the venue requires such a restriction at this restriction is applied to limitation criteria for the player and saved at a data structure associated with the biometric data player account. If there is no required commitment at the player s commitment selection at is applied and the player s information and biometrical data is saved or tagged as an active file at . At the player plays the gaming device . During play the system compares the limitation s to the activity of the player to determine is any imposed limit has been met. If the limitation criteria has not been fulfilled the player may continue play. For example where the player has elected to limit their play to 4 hours in a day the system compares the time of play to the commitment at as the player plays the gaming device . If the limitation has been satisfied at the system generates a signal to the gaming device at to disable the gaming machine from further play by the player. Where a player has moved among various gaming devices the digital cameras capture the facial image of the player and at compare the image to the images in the active file data structure. If a match is obtained the player s limitation s are applied and the system checks at to see if the limitation has been reached. Thus the 4 hour limitation may be enforced even though the player has moved to different gaming devices .

To reduce the number of files over which the biometrical data must be compared the system is configured to disregard or expunge from the active file data structure the biometrical data associated with any limitation commitment which has been met. Thus in the example above when the player s limitation existing for a period of 24 hours from inception has expired the biometric record for the player is for example expunged from the active file data structure. Thus the active file data structure only retains or considers biometric information for active enforceable limitations.

Turning to the function of an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated with regard to a situation where the player has imposed a limit of the cash risked such as 500 for a temporal period such as over a 48 hour period. At the system and gaming device are placed in an operative state. At the gaming device is ready to receive a cash stake such as by a player inserting cash into a bill validator at the gaming device . When money is inserted such as a 100 bill the system and method of the present invention at determines if the camera can capture an identifying facial image of the player. If no image can be obtained such as the camera being inoperative or the player obscuring their face at the money stakes is returned to the player by returning the money from the validator or printing a 100 voucher and dispensing it to the player. If the biometric can be obtained at the system compares the biometric in this example data corresponding to the facial features of the player as captured by the camera . If at a match is obtained and the match corresponds with an active limitation commitment at a determination is made as to whether the player has reached the limit. If the player has exceeded the limit a signal is generated at to refund the player s stake. If the limit has not been reached has been reached at a determination is made as to whether stake would push the accumulated stake to an amount over the limit of 500. If it would then at the amount over 500 is refunded to the player and the remainder is added at to the credits on the gaming device . If the stake of 100 would not cause the limit of 500 to be exceeded at the stake is accepted and converted to credits on the gaming device . The process is completed at .

As stated above when the temporal period for the limiting criteria has expired in the above example 48 hours from inception of the limitation the biometric data associated with the limitation is either disregarded or is expunged to reduce the number of data files for comparison and thereby reduce the number of false positives incorrect matches .

The limitations can be imposed by the player himself herself or by others such as a responsible party regulatory authority casino venue or other third party.

Enforcement of the limitation can be through one or more of disabling the gaming device sending a message to the player sending a message to casino personnel or third party notification of authorities and the like.

The biometrical data can be a combination of information such as finger print as well as facial image data.

When the temporal period of the limitation has expired the file record may be expunged or tagged as inactive. An inactive file may be reactivated when for example a player uses their loyalty card on their next visit.

The system and method can be used across multiple venues such as casinos owned by the same company or casino s in the same geographic area. In such a case the casinos would be networked such that the biometrical and limitation data can be shared.
