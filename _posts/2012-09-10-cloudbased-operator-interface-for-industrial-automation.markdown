This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 587 531 filed on Feb. 9 2012 and entitled INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEMS AND METHODS and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 642 964 filed May 4 2012 and entitled CLOUD GATEWAY FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION INFORMATION. This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 162 315 filed on Jun. 4 2002 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 151 966 on Dec. 19 2006 and entitled SYSTEM AND METHODOLOGY PROVIDING OPEN INTERFACE AND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING IN AN INDUSTRIAL CONTROLLER ENVIRONMENT. The entireties of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The subject application relates generally to industrial automation and more particularly to a cloud based operator interface system for remote monitoring and control of industrial systems.

Industrial controllers and their associated I O devices are central to the operation of modern automation systems. These controllers interact with field devices on the plant floor to control automated processes relating to such objectives as product manufacture material handling batch processing supervisory control and other such applications. Industrial controllers store and execute user defined control programs to effect decision making in connection with the controlled process. Such programs can include but are not limited to ladder logic sequential function charts function block diagrams structured text or other such platforms.

Industrial automation systems often include one or more operator interfaces that allow plant personnel to view telemetry and status data associated with the automation system and to control some aspects of system operation. These operator interfaces typically execute on computers that are networked to one or more industrial controllers used to control the automation system and render selected subsets of data read from the controllers in animated graphical or text formats on pre developed display screens. Operator interfaces can be used to monitor such information as production statistics real time telemetry data e.g. temperatures pressures flow rates motor speeds etc. machine modes and statuses alarm conditions or other such metrics of the automation system being monitored.

Since industrial operator interfaces require access to data within the industrial controllers and therefore must share a common network with the industrial controllers such operator interface systems are conventionally located in proximity to the automation system being monitored. Consequently industrial data and statuses can only be viewed by personnel in proximity to the automation system e.g. on the plant floor . Moreover the data available to such operator interfaces is limited to data stored in controllers sharing a common network with the operator interface terminal.

The above described deficiencies of today s industrial control systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview nor is intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of the various aspects described herein. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a cloud based operator interface system that allows an industrial system to be monitored and or controlled remotely via a cloud platform. To this end an operator interface system running as a service on a cloud platform can receive industrial data from one or more industrial automation systems and render the industrial data on selected Internet capable devices via customized operator interface screens served to the devices from the cloud platform. The industrial data can be provided to the cloud based operator interface system using one or more cloud gateways located at the respective industrial systems. The cloud gateways can gather data from the industrial controllers associated with a given industrial system and push the data to a customer specific operator interface system residing on the cloud platform. In this manner the cloud based operator interface system can collect data from multiple industrial systems at different geographic locations and store filter associate correlate and or aggregate the collected data in meaningful ways according to the needs of the user. The operator interface system can generate displays screens for rendering selected subsets of the collected data and deliver the displays to Internet capable display devices via the Internet. Thus the cloud based operator interface system can allow authorized users to remotely monitor multiple industrial automation systems through any suitable computing device having access to the Internet e.g. phone desktop computer laptop computer tablet computer etc. .

One or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can also support event based notification of critical system events. In such embodiments the cloud based operator interface system can be configured to recognize critical events relating to one or more monitored industrial systems e.g. a system parameter exceeding a setpoint value a particular machine status a machine or system alarm condition etc. and each defined event can be associated with a list of relevant personnel to be notified in response to occurrence of the defined event. When the operator interface system determines that a notification event has occurred e.g. an event at one of the monitored industrial systems or an aggregate status based on aggregated data from multiple industrial systems the operator interface system can deliver notifications of the event to devices associated with the relevant personnel.

The cloud based operator interface system can also contextualize industrial data received from the various industrial systems to enhance the value of the information presented to the user. This can include tagging the data with contextual metadata such as a time a location a production area a machine or process state personnel identifications or other information that provides additional context for the data. This appended contextual data can be leveraged in connection with aggregating filtering or summarizing the data on the cloud platform to facilitate flexible and meaningful presentation of the data to the client devices.

Moreover multiple industrial facilities at different geographical locations can migrate their respective automation data to the cloud for aggregation collation collective analysis and enterprise level reporting without the need to establish a private network between the facilities. Industrial devices and having smart configuration capability can be configured to automatically detect and communicate with the cloud platform upon installation at any facility simplifying integration with existing cloud based data storage analysis or reporting applications used by the enterprise. In another exemplary application cloud based diagnostic applications can monitor the health of respective automation systems or their associated industrial devices across an entire plant or across multiple industrial facilities that make up an enterprise. Cloud based lot control applications can be used to track a unit of product through its stages of production and collect production data for each unit as it passes through each stage e.g. barcode identifier production statistics for each stage of production quality test data abnormal flags etc. . These industrial cloud computing applications are only intended to be exemplary and the systems and methods described herein are not limited to these particular applications. The cloud platform can allow builders of industrial applications to provide scalable solutions as a service removing the burden of maintenance upgrading and backup of the underlying infrastructure and framework.

The cloud based operator interface system may also interact with other hardware and or software components not depicted in . For example processor s may interact with one or more external user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse a display monitor a touchscreen or other such interface devices.

In some embodiments memory can be cloud based storage provided by the cloud platform that maintains and executes the cloud based operator interface system .

Cloud based operator interface system resides on a cloud platform similar to cloud platform of . Industrial systems use respective cloud gateways to push industrial data relating to the industrial systems to the cloud platform for collection and processing at the cloud based operator interface system . Industrial systems may be for example automation systems located at respective manufacturing or processing facilities . One or more of the industrial systems may also be mobile systems e.g. systems embedded in service or cargo vehicles that are to be monitored and or controlled regardless of their location. In some exemplary scenarios the industrial systems will belong to a common industrial enterprise or business and the cloud based operator interface system can be made available to the enterprise as a subscription service. In other exemplary scenarios cloud based operator interface system may provide remote operator interface and visualization services to multiple customers. In such cases industrial systems may belong to multiple different equipment owners or businesses.

In some embodiments the cloud gateways can gather the data from one or more industrial controllers that monitor and control portions of the industrial systems and push the controller data to the cloud platform via web services exposed by a cloud application. Also in some applications the cloud gateways the industrial controllers or other industrial devices comprising the industrial systems may transform the raw industrial data prior to upload to a format better suited to cloud based storage computing or analysis. For example the cloud gateways may filter prune re format aggregate summarize or compress the raw industrial data to more efficiently utilize cloud bandwidth and or storage resources. Alternatively the cloud gateways may upload the raw industrial data to the cloud platform without applying additional transformations to the data.

The cloud based operator interface system receives the industrial data from the multiple industrial systems and makes the data available to client devices associated with users having appropriate access privileges to the data. If the industrial data is to be stored for historian or reporting purposes the cloud based operator interface system can store the data on cloud based storage associated with the cloud platform. The client devices access the cloud based operator interface system through a generic Internet level. To facilitate viewing of the industrial data cloud based operator interface system can serve display screens to the client devices that can be viewed using the devices native display capabilities. The display screens can be preconfigured by an administrator of the cloud based operator interface system although some embodiments can allow the owners of the client devices to customize the way the industrial data is presented on the respective devices. Client devices can be personal device such as mobile phones having graphical display capabilities desktop or laptop computers tablet computers or other such devices. Client devices may also be industrial display devices such as HMI display terminals graphic terminals industrial monitors message displays television monitors or the like.

In one or more embodiments the cloud based operator interface system can apply cloud side processing to the industrial data to facilitate presenting the data in meaningful ways to the client devices . For example cloud based operator interface system can add context to the incoming data e.g. a time date stamp a location associated with the data machine statuses at the time the data was generated etc. . The cloud based operator interface system may also aggregate data from multiple industrial systems according to predefined aggregation rules defined by the user. Using these tools in the context of a cloud based operator interface system data from multiple geographically diverse industrial systems can be collected correlated and aggregated to generate unified enterprise level presentations of the industrial systems as a whole.

In an exemplary scenario cloud platform can comprise a set of cloud resources provisioned to a provider of cloud services as a platform as a service Paas and the cloud services such as the operator interface system described herein can reside and execute on the cloud platform as cloud based services.

Cloud applications such as the cloud based operator interface system and associated cloud services described herein can be built on the cloud platform . In one or more embodiments the cloud platform can be compatible with data models that are developed for enhanced manufacturing intelligence EMI software. Such applications can collect data from a customer s industrial system and correlate the data for the purpose of generating reports creating custom visualizations archiving the data performing system analyses or other functions. The cloud services can support federated security which provides secured access to the cloud services from smart devices such as phones and tablet computers.

The cloud services can deliver visibility reporting analytics and event management via clients which can interface with the cloud services via the generic Internet layer . To cater for smart devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs some cloud services may not leverage flash based dashboards which often cannot be rendered on some mobile devices. Instead some cloud services may include dashboards built based on HyperText Markup Language HTML and or JavaScript technology. Internally such dashboards may use a set of JSON JavaScript Object Notation based web services that are optimized for consumption by HTML Javascript components. The foregoing should be understood as a concrete example and does not exclude the use of other appropriate technologies for communicating data to the client and displaying data on client devices.

The cloud gateway can be any suitable device capable of gathering data from controller or other industrial equipment and pushing the data to the cloud applications on cloud platform . The cloud gateway can be a stand alone device such as a computer running cloud gateway services and sharing a network with the controller . Alternatively the cloud gateway can be embedded in the controller or other piece of industrial equipment. In some embodiments the cloud gateway may also be integrated within a network interface device such as a hub switch router or firewall box residing on a common network with controller . The cloud gateway can include a service responsible for pushing controller data from the controller into cloud based storage on cloud platform via web services exposed by one or more cloud applications e.g. the cloud based operator interface system . One or more embodiments of the cloud gateway can support store and forward logic that causes controller data to be uploaded to the cloud platform to be temporarily stored locally on the gateway in the event that the connection between the gateway and the cloud platform is disrupted. Any suitable communication technology can be used to facilitate communication between the cloud gateway and the cloud platform including but not limited to wireless radio e.g. 3 G 4 G etc. .

In addition to sending controller data to cloud based applications on cloud platform the cloud gateway can also receive configuration instructions from the cloud based applications. For example a cloud based application such as the cloud based operator interface system described herein can send an instruction informing the gateway how frequently data should be uploaded to the cloud based application e.g. every minute every 15 minutes etc. . The cloud gateway can also be configured locally using a stored configuration data that holds such information as a system identifier e.g. identification of the industrial system monitored by the cloud gateway a controller identifier of controller a list of controller tags whose values are to be ready by the gateway and uploaded to the cloud based application a uniform resource locator URL of the cloud based application a maximum amount of data to store locally at the cloud gateway in the event of communication loss between the gateway and the cloud platform or other such configuration information.

The cloud gateways can retrieve data from respective fixed or mobile industrial systems e.g. from one or more industrial controllers that monitor and control the respective industrial systems and send the retrieved data to the cloud based operator interface system . The cloud gateways can reside at different locations e.g. locations of . For example some cloud gateways can be associated with respective automation systems at geographically diverse industrial facilities or at different areas within the same facility which may or may not reside on a common local area network. Some cloud gateways may also be embedded within mobile systems such as service vehicles or cargo trucks having built in control systems or tracking systems.

The cloud gateways can send their respective industrial data to the cloud based operator interface system at a frequency defined by the operator interface system . For example an administrator of the cloud based operator interface system can define an upload frequency individually for the respective cloud gateways and the gateway interface component can provide corresponding configuration instructions to the respective cloud gateways configuring the upload frequencies accordingly. Alternatively or in addition the cloud based operator interface system may dynamically select a suitable upload frequency for the respective cloud gateways during operation. For example in order to control costs associated with cloud resource utilization an administrator of the cloud based operator interface system can in one or more embodiments configure a maximum total bandwidth usage for the cloud based operator interface system such that the total instantaneous bandwidth usage for data traffic between the cloud gateways and the cloud based operator interface system is not to exceed the configured maximum bandwidth. In such embodiments the cloud based operator interface system can monitor the total bandwidth utilization substantially in real time and dynamically reduce the upload frequency of one or more cloud gateways in response to a determination that the total bandwidth usage is approaching the defined maximum bandwidth. In another example an administrator can configure a limit on the total amount of cloud storage to be used for historical data collection. Accordingly if the cloud based operator interface system determines that this storage limit is being approached the operator interface system can send an instruction to one or more cloud gateways to reduce their upload frequencies thereby slowing the consumption of cloud storage resources. The cloud based operator interface system can select which cloud gateways are to be adjusted based on respective criticalities of the control systems associated with the cloud gateways . For example cloud based operator interface system can maintain individual gateway profiles not shown defining relative priorities of the industrial systems associated with each cloud gateway and can leverage this information in connection with determining which cloud gateways are to be selected for reduced upload frequency in the event that one or more cloud resources are being used at an excessive rate.

The industrial data from the cloud gateways are received at gateway interface component which can store the received data on cloud storage if the data is to be archived for later viewing or pass the data directly to client interface component for delivery to an Internet capable client device to facilitate substantially near real time monitoring of the industrial data. Cloud storage can comprise a subset of the cloud platform s storage resources provisioned to an owner of the industrial systems e.g. an industrial enterprise for the purpose of storing the received industrial data. For example cloud storage can be provided to an industrial enterprise as part of a subscription service that includes access to the cloud based operator interface system and its associated cloud services.

Client interface component can serve predesigned interface displays to any Internet capable client device similar to client devices and of respectively having access privileges to the cloud based operator interface system and render selected subsets of the industrial data via the display screens using the client device s native display capabilities. To this end a set of preconfigured display screens can be stored on cloud storage associated with the operator interface system and the client interface component can deliver selected display screens in response to invocation by the client device . The display screens can be developed for example using a development environment provided by the cloud based operator interface system . In one or more embodiments the cloud based operator interface system can provide this development environment as a cloud service allowing a developer to remotely access a set of cloud side interface screen development tools to facilitate design of interface screen layouts data links graphical animations and navigation links between screens. In such embodiments the interface screen development environment can allow the developer to leverage cloud resources e.g. cloud storage and processing resources to develop a set of display screens for a given operator interface application to be run on the operator interface system . Alternatively some embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can allow display screens developed by external display development applications to be uploaded to the cloud platform and executed by the operator interface system during runtime.

Each of the display screens can include display tags defining which data items are to be displayed on the respective screens formats for the respective data items desired graphical animations to be associated with the respective data items graphical elements to be included on the respective display screens e.g. externally defined graphical elements definitions and other such configuration information. Some display screens can also be configured to render alarm or informational messages in response to determinations that subsets of the industrial data provided by cloud gateways have met certain conditions e.g. in response to a determination that a given industrial parameter has exceeded a defined setpoint or that a defined production goal has been met . Since industrial data can be received from multiple industrial systems possibly at diverse geographical locations alarms notification events animation triggers and the like can be defined in terms of composite industrial data values for multiple industrial systems allowing the industrial systems to be viewed and analyzed from a high level enterprise perspective. For example consider a scenario in which a particular product is being produced at three different facilities e.g. locations of . The respective cloud gateways can deliver production statistics to the gateway interface component and the operator interface system can aggregate these production statistics substantially in real time to yield composite data e.g. a total production count for all three facilities even though the three facilities may not be communicatively networked together over a data network. One or more of the displays screens can be configured to display these composite production statistics trigger alarms or graphical animations as a function of the composite statistics etc. Client interface component can deliver these display screens to an authorized client device having Internet access and suitable authorization credentials providing an owner of the client device with an enterprise level view of the multiple industrial systems monitored by the operator interface system .

The cloud based operator interface system can support conditional display of industrial data based on defined user roles having different levels of access privileges. Accordingly the operator interface system can allow multiple user roles to be defined e.g. operator plant manager finance accounting administrator etc. and customize the presentation of industrial data for the respective user roles. For example an administrator can associate a given user role with a subset of display screens that users belonging to that user role are allowed to access. In another example selected data displays on the display screens can be configured with visibility links that render the selected data visible only to users associated with certain authorized user roles.

In order to provide support for user specific customization cloud based operator interface system can maintain a set of user profiles corresponding to respective users of the system. An exemplary user profile can include such information as a user identifier one or more user roles to which the user belongs and any user defined preferences configured by the user. For example some user roles may be given permission to customize certain presentation aspects of the display screens from their client device e.g. alter an arrangement of data items on the screen customize colors render selected data valves invisible etc. . When a user having such permissions customizes such presentation aspects at the client device the operator interface system can save these preferences to the user s profile. When the user subsequently invokes the customized display screen the client interface component will access the user s profile and apply the previously defined customization settings to the display screen prior to serving the display screen to the client device .

In a related aspect one or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can allow individual users to subscribe to selected real time data feeds from one or more industrial systems. For example a maintenance engineer may be interested in monitoring a particular performance metric of a specific machine at a plant facility. The operator interface system can allow the engineer to identify the machine and the performance metric e.g. a temperature of a die cast oven and add this data feed to one of the existing display screens as a user preference. Alternatively the operator interface system can create a new custom screen in response to the subscription request. In either case the subscription information can be stored in the engineer s user profile and the client interface component can render a live feed of the selected performance metric to the engineer s client device upon request.

Since the operator interface displays can be served to diverse types of client devices e.g. desktop computers mobile phones tablet computers laptop computers HMI terminals television monitors etc. the cloud based operator interface system can render a given display screen in a format suitable for display on the device invoking the screen and in a manner that makes efficient use of the device s resources. For example if the operator interface system receives a request for a display screen from a cellular phone the client interface component can deliver the requested display screen to the cellular phone in a format adapted to the display capabilities of the phone e.g. at a display ratio and resolution suitable for display on the phone s screen .

One or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can also support delivery of multimedia presentations to client device . For example in addition to presentation of production data retrieved from industrial controllers users may wish to view a live video or audio video feed of an industrial process. Accordingly cloud gateways can deliver live video or audio video stream information e.g. from a web camera to the gateway interface component and the client interface component can deliver this video stream to client device in response to a request from the client device . In such embodiments the operator interface system can be configured to overlay selected subsets of live industrial data also received from the cloud gateways on the video to yield a composite presentation of the system.

In addition to delivery of industrial data from the cloud gateways one or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can also support two way data exchange allowing users to send data or issue commands to industrial systems remotely from a client device via the cloud platform. For example an operator may interact with interface display rendered on client device by the operator interface system to enter a new setpoint value for a selected machine at a remote automation system e.g. via a data field provided on the operator interface screen . The client device can send the new setpoint value to the cloud based operator interface system via client interface component . The gateway interface component can deliver this new setpoint value to a controller associated with the selected machine via the appropriate cloud gateway . The cloud gateway can write the new setpoint value to the appropriate controller data tag or register thereby implementing the new setpoint. In a similar manner the cloud based operator interface system can allow single bit commands to be issued from the client device such as start stop commands issued via a graphical pushbutton rendered on the interface display .

In order to enhance the value of received industrial data and provide greater depth for analysis one or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can add context to the data received by the cloud gateways . To this end context component can append contextual metadata to selected subsets of the industrial data as it is received by the cloud gateways thereby providing useful context information for the industrial data that can be leveraged by the operator interface system in connection with cloud side analysis to enhance the user s understanding of the monitored industrial systems.

Turning briefly to an exemplary context component for transforming raw industrial data into contextualized data is illustrated. Context component similar to context component of receives raw industrial data e.g. from cloud gateways of and enhances the raw data with one or more pieces of context data to yield contextualized data . For example context component can apply a time stamp to the raw data indicating a time a date and or a production shift when the data was generated. The applied context data may also include a production area or plant facility that yielded the data a particular product that was being produced when the data was generated a state of a machine e.g. auto semi auto abnormal etc. at the time the data was generated a geographical location of the data source in the case of mobile control and or monitoring systems where such geographical location information can be received from a GPS device associated with the mobile system etc. Other examples of context information include an employee on shift at the time the data was generated a lot number with which the data is associated or an alarm that was active at the time the data was generated. Context component can also apply an actionable data tag to the raw data if it is determined that the data requires action to be taken by plant personnel or by another cloud based application.

Context component can also apply contextual information to the raw data that reflects the data s location within a hierarchical organizational model. Such an organization model can represent an industrial enterprise in terms of multiple hierarchical levels. In an exemplary organizational model the hierarchical levels can include from lowest to highest a workcell level a line level an area level a site level and an enterprise level. Devices that are components of a given automation system can be described and identified in terms of these hierarchical levels allowing a common terminology to be used across the entire enterprise to identify devices machines and data within the enterprise. In some embodiments the organizational model can be known to the context component which can stamp the raw data with a hierarchical identification tag that indicates the data s origin within the organizational hierarchy e.g. Company Marysville DieCastArea 1Headline LeakTestCell .

Returning now to some embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can also include cloud side analysis tools which allow the received industrial data to be correlated and analyzed on the cloud platform. In particular an analytics component similar to analytics component of can analyze subsets of the industrial data received from the cloud gateways according to predefined user criteria. In an exemplary application an administrator or other user with appropriate administrative rights can specify that production statistics from production lines at multiple geographically diverse facilities are to be aggregated and a notification is to be sent to selected users when these aggregated production statistics exceed a defined setpoint e.g. when a total production count of all production lines reaches a defined goal . Accordingly analytics component can aggregate the indicated production statistics substantially in real time as the industrial data is received by the respective cloud gateways and monitor these aggregated statistics to determine when the aggregate numbers meet the defined trigger event. When the analytics component determines that the production goal has been met it can instruct the client interface component to deliver an indication e.g. a message or graphical animation on a display screen a text message etc. to one or more client devices associated with the relevant personnel.

Analytics component can also be configured to analyze the incoming industrial data to identify short term or long term trends that may be of interest to users. For example an administrator can configure the operator interface system to store selected subsets of the industrial data or aggregates thereof in cloud storage and configure the analytics component to identify possible correlations between two sets of the stored data. In this regard the analytics component can leverage the contextual metadata added by the context component to facilitate robust analysis of the industrial data. For example the analytics component may identify that a particular industrial machine runs less efficiently during certain work shifts or times of day based on the received industrial data as well as date time stamps or work shift identifiers applied to the data by the context component . The analytics component can also monitor the industrial data to detect outliers or anomalies that may indicate either abnormal system operation or inaccurate data e.g. a malfunctioning telemetry device or sensor and instruct the client interface component to deliver a suitable alert to the client device .

As mentioned above one or more embodiments of the cloud based operator interface system can include notification services for notifying relevant personnel of a detected event. Accordingly the cloud based operator interface system can include a notification component similar to notification component of configured to deliver such notifications to the selected client devices according to predefined user preferences. illustrates an exemplary notification architecture according to one or more embodiments of this disclosure. In this example one or more controlled processes are monitored and or controlled by industrial device which can be an industrial controller a sensor a meter a motor drive or other such device. Alternatively industrial device may be a separate device e.g. a proxy device that is not directly involved in monitoring or controlling the controlled process es but instead collects process data from industrial devices involved with controlling the controlled process es and delivers this data to the cloud platform. In such embodiments industrial device can be for example a firewall box or other such network infrastructure device a data collection server or other suitable device capable of collecting or generating industrial data and providing this data to the cloud platform.

Industrial device collects industrial data from controlled process es or generates process data internally based on monitored conditions of the controlled process es . In the present example the cloud based operator interface system running on the cloud platform can include notification component similar to notification component of which can be configured to receive industrial data from a cloud gateway associated with a customer s plant floor equipment and to route notifications to appropriate plant personnel in accordance with predefined notification criteria.

On the cloud platform analytics component similar to analytics component of can determine whether selected subsets of the industrial data or aggregations thereof meet one or more predefined notification conditions. These can include such conditions as detecting that a particular process value has exceeded a defined setpoint detecting a transition to a particular machine state detecting an alarm condition determining that a specified production goal has been achieved or other such conditions that can be detected through analysis of the industrial data . When the analytics component detects an actionable condition within the industrial data analytics component can inform the notification component that personnel are to be notified. In response the notification component can identify one or more specific plant employees who are to receive the notification as well as information identifying a user notification device phone number or email address for each person to be notified.

In one or more embodiments the notification component can determine this notification information by cross referencing a configuration data that identifies which personnel are to be notified for a given type of condition one or more notification methods for each identified person and or other relevant information. When analytics component determines that a subset of the industrial data requires action to be taken by plant personnel notification component can reference configuration data to determine for example which personnel should be notified which user devices should receive the notification a required action to be taken by the recipient a due date for the action a format for the notification and or other relevant information. Configuration data can maintain multiple separate personnel lists respectively associated with different types of actionable situations. In some embodiments the personnel list selected for a given notification can be at least partly a function of the context data appended by context component . For example if industrial data indicates that a process parameter has exceeded a setpoint value the notification component can identify the list of personnel to receive the notification based on the area or workcell to which the process parameter relates.

Once the notification component had determined the appropriate personnel and devices to be notified the notification component can deliver notifications to one or more notification destinations. The notification can be sent to one or more identified Internet capable client devices such as a phone a tablet computer a desktop computer or other suitable devices. In some embodiments a cloud application running on the cloud platform can provide a mechanism for notified personnel to communicate with one another via the cloud e.g. establish a conference call using Voice over IP . In some embodiments the notification component can be configured to send the notification periodically at a defined frequency until the user positively responds to the notification e.g. by sending a manual acknowledgement via the client device . The notification component can also be configured to escalate an urgency of high priority notifications if an acknowledgment is not received within a predetermined amount of time. This urgency escalation can entail sending the notification at a gradually increasing frequency sending the notification to devices associated with secondary personnel if the primary personnel do not respond within a defined time period or other such escalation measures.

Optionally at the industrial data can be at least one of contextualized filtered or aggregated on the cloud platform by the operator interface system. For example the cloud based operator interface can enhance some or all of the industrial data with contextual metadata that provides a context for the data such as a time date stamp a geographic location production area or machine from which the data was received a state of a process at the time the data was generated on the plant floor identifications of plant personnel on duty at the time the data was generated or other such contextual information. Related sets of data can also be aggregated for example production data from geographically diverse industrial facilities manufacturing a common product or filtered to remove redundant data.

At one or more operator interface screens are generated by the cloud based operator interface system for rendering a selected subset of the industrial data. The operator interface screens can comprise pre developed display screens stored on a subset of the cloud platform s storage resources and which can be invoked by the remote client devices through the Internet. At the one or more operator interface screens are delivered to an Internet capable client device. In one or more embodiments the cloud based operator interface system can tailor the one or more operator interface screens to adapt to the particular display capabilities of the client device based on a determination of a type of device being served e.g. mobile phone with limited display capabilities a desktop computer a tablet computer etc. . At at least a subset of the industrial data is rendered on the client device via the one or more operator interface screens.

If it is determined at that the notification condition has been met the methodology moves to step where a determination is made regarding which users of the operator interface system are to be notified. The operator interface system can make this determination for example by referencing configuration data that identifies which personnel are to be notified for a given type of system condition one or more notification methods for each identified person and or other such information. At a notification is delivered from the cloud platform to the devices associated with the users identified at step . The notification can be sent to any suitable Internet capable client device such as a phone a tablet computer a desktop computer or other such devices. It is to be appreciated that steps may continue to be performed while notification steps and are executing as new industrial data is received at the operator interface system.

At automation data generated by an industrial automation system is received at the cloud based operator interface system. The data can be receive for example by a cloud gateway that reads the automation data from an industrial controller and pushes the data to the cloud platform for use by the cloud based operator interface system. At a request for one of the stored operator interface screens is received from a client device over the Internet. In response to receiving the request at a user profile associated with the client device is access to determine whether any previously stored display preferences are to be applied to the requested operator interface screen prior to delivery. For example a user of the client device may have customized one or more aspects of the requested operator interface screen during a previous viewing. These customized aspects can be stored in the user profile associated with the client device so that the cloud based operator interface system can apply the user s preferences the next time the screen is invoked by the client device. In this manner a common set of operator interface screens can be stored on the cloud platform and served to multiple users in accordance with respective user display preferences.

If it is determined at that the user profile specifies a display preference the display preference is applied to the operator interface screen at . At the requested operator interface screen is delivered to the client device over the Internet. If it is determined at that no display preferences are to be applied the methodology moves directly to step without applying a display preference at . At a live feed of a subset of the automation data is delivered to the client device via the requested operator interface screen.
