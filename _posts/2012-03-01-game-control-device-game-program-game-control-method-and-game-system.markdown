This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 050994 filed on Mar. 9 2011 and the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 198063 filed on Sep. 12 2011 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a technology for executing a match up game to be executed on a network by the unspecified majority of game players through communication terminals accessible to the network.

Game players have enjoyed playing games by operating game devices for themselves. In such well known situations the game devices normally include hardware for loading and running video game application software i.e. video game application . Match up games e.g. baseball games have been popular as video games to be run by such video game applications. To realize video games full of amusement diversity has been embedded not only in types of the match up but also in the other factors. As an example of diversity the video games have been embedded with a function of allowing a game player to customize an ability of a game character i.e. a player character as a game player s operating target.

For example Japan Laid open Patent Application Publication No. JP A 2000 189677 describes a game system a baseball game including a schedule creating unit configured to create an action schedule of a player character. The game system is configured to change e.g. enhance an ability of the player character for instance through an instruction of causing the player character to perform a specific action. In the game system it is assumed that a game player plays a nurturing mode of nurturing i.e. enhances the ability of the player character and then plays a match up mode with another game player or computer or alternatively a game player alternately plays the nurturing mode and the match up mode.

Now so called social games have been recently widespread. The social games are configured to be run by video game applications created based on the operating environment such as API Application Programming Interface to be operated on web browsers in SNS Social Networking Service . The social games are a type of online games to be played by the unspecified majority of game players communicating with each other. However unlike the well known online games the social games are not a type of games to be played by game players through video game devices with a communication function and video game software embedded therein. Therefore game players are not required to install or download such video game software. In short game players can execute social games if they bring web browser embedded communication devices with them. For example game players can enjoy playing social games regardless of time and places if they bring portable terminals accessible to the Internet with them.

Some of the aforementioned social games are of user friendly. In the cases of match up types the social games are often configured to allow game players to immediately confirm a result of a match up. Therefore such social games are now being accepted by game players who do not want to spend much time for playing games or game players who want to casually play games. On the other hand the social games have a drawback that the game element thereof is simple for game players who have enjoyed playing games by operating the well known game devices and such game players may thereby easily get bored. In a baseball game using a game device of the well known type for instance a game player operating a batter character is required to perform an operation of causing the batter character to swing a bat towards a ball moving towards the batter character in an appropriate timing. When a baseball game is realized as a social game by contrast a simple operation of pressing a button without considering timing may be only required without requiring such an operation to be performed with concentration. Therefore those game players who want to fully enjoy playing a baseball game are not satisfied with the baseball games to be realized as the social games. By contrast those game players who want to casually enjoy playing a baseball game easily accept the baseball games to be realized as the social games due to simple operability thereof. Rather simple operability can be an essential point for those game players who cannot spend much time for playing games.

The aforementioned well known baseball games would be highly amusing in that an element of nurturing a player character is embedded therein. However each game player is required to perform a time consuming operation of nurturing a player character and subsequently playing match ups with other game players or a computer. Therefore it is not easy for a lot of game players who want to enjoy playing games with a simple operation for a short period of time to accept the well known baseball games.

The present invention has been proposed in view of the above. It is an object of the present invention to provide a game control device a game program a game control method and a game system which are full of amusement and allow a game player to play a game with a simple operation without getting the game player bored.

The other is a league competition i.e. a second match up configured to be automatically held between player characters associated with different unique game player IDs without a game player s operational input at the communication terminal .

It should be noted that the term match up between game player IDs will be hereinafter synonymous for the term match up between characters associated with different unique game player IDs .

A game progressing unit has a function of progressing the video game configured to be displayed on each game player s communication terminal through the webpage displayed thereon in accordance with a game player s operation of the communication terminal . For example as the game processing unit the CPU of the game server is configured to transmit the HTML data to the communication terminal through the communication interface unit for allowing the communication terminal to display a new webpage in accordance with either Hyperlink or an object selected by each game player on the currently displayed webpage. The CPU is configured to sequentially transmit new HTML data in accordance with the Hyperlink object selected by each game player on the currently displayed webpage. Accordingly the webpage displayed on the communication terminal is sequentially switched. Each game player thereby recognizes progression of the video game.

Further when receiving an access request message from the communication terminal through the communication interface prior to start of the video game the CPU of the game server as the game progressing unit is configured to execute a predetermined authentication processing and subsequently recognize a game player ID included in the access request message from the communication terminal . Yet further the CPU of the game server is configured to manage progression of the video game displayed on the respective communication terminals on a game player ID basis. For example a game player ID may be configured to be assigned to a game player after the game player accesses the website of the baseball game provided by the game server through the communication terminal and completes a predetermined procedure.

When a game player selects one of the text character sequences illustrated in by operating the directional instruction button and the confirmation button of the operation input unit the CPU of the game server as the game progressing unit is configured to recognize a result of a game player s selection through the communication interface unit and transmit new HTML data to the communication terminal . As a result the display unit of the communication terminal displays a new webpage in accordance with the result of the game player s selection.

A storage unit has a function of storing ability values of player characters in association with game player IDs. In the present exemplary embodiment the storing unit is realized by the player database of the database server . It should be noted that in this specification the storage unit may refer to an operational function to store data realized by game control device. The storage unit may refer to the player database storage device .

When each game player obtains a game player ID default setting values are set as ability values of player characters associated with the game player ID. In other words the CPU of the game server accesses the player database and writes the default data of the ability values of the player characters associated with the game player ID and in turn the player database stores the default data of the ability values.

A first match up executing unit is configured to execute an individual competition i.e. the first match up between player characters associated with different game player IDs in response to an operational input at the communication terminal and determine a result of the individual competition based on the abilities of the player characters stored in the storage unit i.e. the player database of the database server in the present exemplary embodiment .

As the first match up executing unit the CPU of the game server is firstly configured to determine an opponent of a game player in the individual competition based on a game player s operational input at the operation input unit of the communication terminal . When MATCH UP GAME is selected on the webpage illustrated in for instance an exemplary webpage illustrated in is displayed as a new webpage for selecting an opponent in the individual competition. In the exemplary webpage illustrated in respective display regions objects correspond to game player IDs and display text character sequences associated with the game player IDs team names RIC . . . TOM . . . and etc. in the case of . In addition to a text character sequence associated with a game player ID each display region may display property data associated with the game player ID such as a skill level e.g. Lv. XX of a game player having the game player ID an image associated with the game player ID and an avatar. When a game player executes an operation of selecting one of the objects associated with the plural game player IDs with respect to the communication terminal information of the selected game player ID is configured to be transmitted to the game server . As the first match up executing unit the CPU of the game server is consequently configured to transmit the HTML data to the communication terminal based on the game player ID selected by the game player for allowing the communication terminal to display a webpage to prompt confirmation of the opponent and start of the match up game see illustrating an exemplary webpage .

In the example illustrated in it is preferable to display the skill levels associated with game player IDs as prospective opponents in accordance with the ability values of the player character of the game player ID assigned to a game player currently selecting an opponent. It is further preferable to display a skill level corresponding to the ability values of the player character associated with the game player ID assigned to the game player currently selecting an opponent in addition to the skill levels associated with the game player IDs as the prospective opponents. With the display configuration the game player currently selecting an opponent can select an appropriate opponent by comparing the skill level associated with his her game player ID and the skill levels associated with the game player IDs of the prospective opponents. For example it is possible to exclude from the prospective opponents such game player IDs associated with player characters with ability values much greater than those of the player character associated with the game player ID of the game player currently selecting an opponent.

In transmitting the HTML data for displaying the webpage exemplified in the CPU of the game server is configured to access the player database of the database server read out ability values of the player characters associated with each game player ID and determine the skill levels based on a predetermined criterion using the read out ability values.

When a game player executes an operation of selecting the object containing the text character sequence PLAY BALL on the webpage exemplified in the selection result is configured to be transmitted to the CPU of the game server . Accordingly an individual competition is configured to be held between player characters associated with different unique game player IDs. In executing the individual competition the CPU of the game server as the first match up executing unit is configured to access the player database of the database server through the database access unit and read out information of the ability values of the player characters associated with two game player IDs as opponents. Further the CPU is configured to execute the individual competition between the player characters associated with the two read out game player IDs based on the read out player characters.

Any suitable method can be employed as a method of determining win loss of the individual competition as long as the ability values of player characters affect win loss of the individual competition in the method. For example based on comparison between ability values of player characters associated with two unique game players IDs as opponents the player character with a greater ability value may be configured to win the individual competition at a higher percentage e.g. a predetermined percentage range of 60 90 . The winning percentage may be set to be higher in proportion to magnitude of difference between ability values. When there are plural ability value items as objects for comparison as illustrated in it is possible to set a comprehensive ability value by weighting each ability value item with a predetermined coefficient e.g. weighting batting ability running ability and fielding ability with 0.4 0.2 and 0.4 respectively in the example of .

When determining the result of the individual competition between player characters associated with two unique game player IDs as opponents the CPU of the game server as the first match up executing unit is configured to transmit the HTML data to the communication terminals of the two game players having the unique game player IDs as opponents for allowing the communication terminals to display a webpage containing the result of the match up. In turn each of the communication terminals is configured to interpret the HTML data received from the game server and display the match up result on the display unit thereof. illustrate exemplary screens to be displayed on the display unit . illustrates an exemplary webpage to be displayed on the communication terminal of one game player having a game player ID associated with a winning player character of the individual competition. On the other hand illustrates an exemplary webpage to be displayed on the communication terminal of the other game player having a game player ID associated with a losing player character of the individual competition. In each of an image Sa illustrates a webpage to be displayed first for showing only the result of the match up. On the other hand an image Sb illustrates a webpage for showing the result of the match up in detail. The webpage of the image Sb is newly displayed in response to a predetermined operation an operation of selecting a predetermined object on the webpage an operation of pressing the directional instruction button etc. on the webpage illustrated in the image Sa. It should be noted that details of the result of the match up score a player character corresponding to a winning losing pitcher etc. may be randomly determined.

The webpage exemplified in the image Sa of is configured to be displayed in quite a short period of time e.g. a few seconds after a game player selects an object containing the text character sequence PLAY BALL on the webpage exemplified in . Therefore the game player is allowed to know the result of the match up in quite a short period of time only through a simple operation i.e. an operation of starting the individual competition i.e. an operation of selecting the object containing the text character sequence PLAY BALL .

A character ability updating unit has a function of updating ability values of a player character associated with a game player ID based on the result of the individual competition i.e. the first match up on an automatic basis or in response to a game player s operation of the communication terminal.

As the character ability updating unit the CPU of the game server is configured to access the player database of the database server and update ability values of a player character based on the result of the individual competition between the player character and its opponent i.e. player characters associated with different game player IDs on an automatic basis or in response to an operation of the communication terminal by a game player having the player character. In other words the CPU is configured to write new ability values in the player database .

When a player character associated with a game player ID wins the individual competition the character ability updating unit is preferably configured to update present ability values of the player character to be greater than the present ability values thereof. When a player character associated with a game player ID loses the individual competition by contrast the character ability updating unit is preferably configured to update the present ability values of the player character to be less than the present ability values thereof. It should be noted that the amount of change for the ability values may be arbitrarily set. When plural ability value items are set as illustrated in for instance all the ability values of a player character may be configured to be increased or reduced by the same amount. Alternatively the amount of change may be randomly set for the ability values.

A second match up executing unit is configured to automatically execute a league competition i.e. the second match up at least between two player characters associated with different unique game player IDs without an operational input at the communication terminal and determine a result of a match up in the league competition based on ability values of the player characters joining in the league competition stored in the storage unit i.e. the player database of the database server in the present exemplary embodiment .

The league competition to be executed by the second match up executing unit is configured to be held at a predetermined clock time e.g. a time set by a timer embedded in the game server . All the game player IDs may be configured to participate or register in the league competition. Alternatively only some of the game player IDs desiring to participate in the league competition may be configured to participate in the league competition.

The schedule of the league competition may be arbitrarily set. An exemplary schedule of the league competition may be set as follows. A player character associated with a given game player ID participating in the league competition is configured to play the league competition for five days from Monday to Friday. The second match up executing unit is configured to automatically execute match ups between player characters associated with different unique game player IDs participating in the league competition at a predetermined clock time every day for five days without an operational input at the communication terminal . A player character associated with a given game player ID participating in the league competition is configured to play match ups with e.g. 15 player characters associated with the other 15 different unique game player IDs every day. Then a ranking i.e. an order in the ranking in the league competition held in the week including the aforementioned five days is determined based on the results of 75 match ups held between the player characters associated with the respective game player IDs for five days. It should be noted that a predetermined clock time is set as the scheduled clock time when the above configured league competition is held. However an alternative configuration may be assumed that the league competition is automatically held at predetermined intervals such as every six hours. Yet alternatively the league competition may be configured to be held every other day or once in a week without being held everyday.

The second match up executing unit may be configured to execute a method of determining win loss of a match up similarly to the first match up executing unit . In other words any method can be herein employed as long as ability values of player characters affect win loss of a match up in the method.

It should be noted that it takes a predetermined period of time for determining the results of all the match ups in the league competition and ability values of a player character can be updated in accordance with execution of individual competition even in the predetermined period of time. Therefore copy data of the player database is configured to be created at a clock time when the league competition is started and ability values of a player character stored in the copy data are configured to be referred to during processing of the second match up executing unit . Accordingly the ability values of a player character i.e. the very data of the player database can be continued to be updated by the character ability updating unit even during processing of the second match up executing unit .

The second match up executing unit is configured to record results of match ups in the league competition s at least for a predetermined term in the past. As the second match up executing unit the CPU of the game server is specifically configured to access the database server and write the results of the match ups in the league competition s in the league competition database stored in the database server .

Now illustrates an example of the league competition database . In the example illustrated in the league competition is held everyday and results of match ups in the league competition are recorded on a day by day basis. In the example of a result of each match up in each league competition contains a match up ID for specifying each match up a game player ID associated with a winning player character i.e. a winning game player ID a game player ID associated with a losing player character i.e. a losing game player ID scores and the other data e.g. data of a player character corresponding to a winning pitcher .

The second match up executing unit is configured to record and sequentially update the ranking of a game player ID in the league competition. As the second match up executing unit the CPU of the game server is specifically configured to access the league competition database of the database server read out the results of the past match ups within a league competition and calculate the ranking for a game player ID based on the read out results of the match ups. The CPU is then configured to access the database server and write the calculated ranking in the ranking database stored in the database server . When the league competition is consecutively held everyday for five days for instance the CPU is configured to calculate the ranking of each game player ID at the timing when all the match ups are finished on the date and write the ranking in the ranking database . Accordingly the ranking of each game player ID is updated in the ranking database everyday.

Now illustrates an example of the ranking database . In the example illustrated in rankings of game player IDs are sequentially recorded therein in a descending order from the first to the last and further the numbers of wins losses and ties in the league competition are recorded therein on a game player ID basis.

A notifying unit is configured to notify each game player s communication terminal of results of match ups in a single or plurality of the league competitions i.e. the second match up either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times and or the ranking order in the ranking of each game player ID based on the results of the match ups. The predetermined term in the past may refer to a week before the week of the day when the video game is executed or alternatively refer to a term immediately before the day when the video game is executed or the preceding day of the day when the video game is executed.

When recognizing that LEAGUE COMPETITION is selected on the webpage illustrated in for instance the CPU of the game server as the notifying unit is configured to transmit the HTML data to each game player s communication terminal for allowing it to display a webpage containing the results of match ups in an immediate league competition and or a game player ID based ranking based on the results of match ups in a single or plurality of league competitions either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times. illustrates an exemplary webpage to be displayed on the communication terminal as a result of interpretation of the HTML data. The exemplary webpage illustrated in displays the result in the league competition on a game player ID basis e.g. a result of 45 wins and 15 losses and 6573rd ranking . The webpage exemplified in is configured to be scrolled by means of the directional instruction button of the operation input unit of the communication terminal or the like in order to display information of the league competition regarding the respective seasons the forth fifth and sixth seasons . Also is an exemplary screen regarding a specific date when the fifth season of the league competition is being held. From bottom to top the exemplary screen sequentially displays the results of the match ups in the fourth season of the league competition the results of the match ups in the fifth season of the league competition a schedule for match ups in the sixth season of the league competition and the comprehensive win loss results and ranking in the present league competition.

As described above the notifying unit is herein configured to transmit the HTML data to each game player s communication terminal for allowing it to display the webpage containing the game player ID based ranking based on the results of the match ups in the league competition as illustrated in . Except for information of characters and images any suitable type of information may be herein notified as long as each game player can recognize the information contents. The suitable type of information may include voice information vibrations and the other tactually detectable information.

In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment each game player s communication terminal is configured to be notified of the results of match ups in a single or plurality of league competitions i.e. the second match up either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times and or the ranking order in the ranking based on the results of the match ups on a game player ID basis. However each game player s communication terminal may be notified of an evaluation value on a game player ID basis instead of the ranking order in the ranking on a game player ID basis. The evaluation value refers to an index value for evaluating results of match ups of a game player based on a criterion different from the ranking order in the ranking . For example as will be explained in Modification 2 later the evaluation value may be a point value obtained by converting a winning rate in the league competition. Alternatively each game player s communication terminal may be notified of the ranking within a class instead of the ranking order in the ranking on a game player ID basis. Specifically all the rankings in a class may be divided into ten sub classes where the class is set as the highest while the class is set as the lowest. Each game player s communication terminal may be notified of a rank i.e. class that the game player ID of each game player is currently classified. Yet alternatively as will be explained in Modification 6 later each game player s communication terminal may be configured to be notified of information regarding prediction of a class to which the game player ID of each game player is classified after a promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up based on the results of the match ups in the league competition i.e. the second match up in a display manner with PROMOTION RANGE DEMOTION TRANGE and etc.

As described above ability values of a player character is updated based on a result of the individual competition and the updated player character plays the league competition. Therefore each game player is motivated to win a lot of match ups in the individual competition by the preliminarily notified clock time in the real world when a league competition is started in order to enhance ability values of a player character associated with his her game player ID by the preliminarily notified clock time in the real world. In other words according to the game control device each game player comes to deliberately play the individual competition in consideration of the aforementioned clock time when the league competition is started i.e. each game player comes to perform an operation of the communication terminal for the individual competition . In short the game control device can highly motivate each game player to play the individual competition and can attract each game player further to the video game.

Next an exemplary processing flow of the baseball game according to the present exemplary embodiment will be explained with reference to the flowcharts represented in . is a flowchart from the activation of the web browser of a communication terminal to the execution of a processing of updating ability values of a player character. is a flowchart for representing a processing of executing the league competition i.e. the second match up .

Firstly with reference to a communication terminal receives a predetermined game player s operational input at the operation input unit and activates the web browser Step S . After the activation of the web browser the communication terminal receives a predetermined game player s operational input at the operation input unit and accesses the website of the baseball game provided by the game server Step S . It is herein assumed that the game player operating the communication terminal has already obtained a unique game player ID. After this point of time the game server manages a game player s access through the communication terminal on a game player ID basis.

When the communication terminal accesses the website of the baseball game the game progressing unit is activated. The game progressing unit causes the communication terminal to display the webpage of the main menu as illustrated in Step S . When MATCH UP GAME is selected on the main menu YES Step S the game progressing unit causes the communication terminal to display a list of opponents List of game player IDs see as a new webpage see the example in for selecting an opponent in the individual competition Step S .

Next when any one of the opponents i.e. the game player IDs is selected through an appropriate game player s operation with respect to the operation input unit of the communication terminal YES Step S the first match up executing unit transmits the HMTL data to the communication terminal for allowing it to display the webpage exemplified in for prompting confirmation of the opponent and starting of the match up based on the game player ID as the opponent selected by the game player. Subsequently when starting of the match up is instructed through a selection operation on the webpage displayed on the communication terminal the first match up executing unit executes the individual competition between a player character associated with the game player ID of the game player herein operating the communication terminal and a player character associated with the game player ID selected as the opponent of this game player. The first match up executing unit determines a result of the individual competition based on the ability values of the player characters stored in the storage unit i.e. the player database of the database server in the present exemplary embodiment Step S . The result of the individual competition is determined based on the ability values of the player characters associated with the game player IDs as opponents. For example the first match up executing unit compares the ability values of the player characters associated with two game player IDs as opponents and determines the match up result for allowing the player character with a greater ability value to win the match up at a higher probability. It should be noted that the match up result is determined in a quite short period of time.

Once determining the result of the individual competition the first match up executing unit transmits the HTML data to the communication terminals of two game players having the game player IDs as opponents for allowing them to display the webpage containing the match up result. Accordingly the match up result is displayed on i.e. notified to the communication terminals through display of the webpage Step S .

Next the character ability updating unit is activated. Specifically the character ability updating unit updates the ability values of the player characters associated with the game player IDs stored in the storage unit i.e. the player database based on the result of the individual competition Step S . When a player character associated with a given game player ID wins the individual competition for instance the character ability updating unit updates the ability values of the player character to be increased from the present values thereof. When the player character associated the given game player ID loses the individual competition by contrast the character ability updating unit updates the ability value of the player character to be reduced from the present values thereof. Therefore each game player comes to actively play the individual competition for enhancing the ability values of the player character associated with his her game player ID. From the standpoint of each game player the individual competition can be executed by a quite simple operation. Further the game server is not required to execute a complex computation processing for the match up. Therefore a game player can get the match up result quite easily in a short time.

Next an execution processing of a league competition will be hereinafter explained with reference to . It should be noted the execution processing will be explained using an exemplary case in which the league competition is held for five days from Monday to Friday as illustrated in . In this case the rankings of the game player IDs are determined based on the results of the first to fifth seasons for five days in the league competition. As described above it is preferable to start the respective seasons of the league competition at a fixed clock time preliminarily notified to game players such as at three o clock in the afternoon in the real world.

At a clock time when the league competition is started everyday from Monday to Friday in YES Step S the second match up executing unit is activated. The second match up executing unit is automatically activated without an operational input at the communication terminal by a game player having a game player ID participating in the league competition. When the first season of the league competition is held for instance the second match up executing unit determines match up combinations in the first season of the league competition i.e. match up combinations of a player character associated with a given game player ID and player characters associated with a predetermined number of the other game player IDs Step S . When determining the match up combinations the second match up executing unit then refers to the player database and determines results of the match ups based on the ability values of the player characters i.e. so that differences between the ability values of the player characters can affect wins losses of the match ups Step S . In the first season of the league competition match up results are determined for totally M N match ups where M is set as the number of match ups held for a player character of each game player ID and N is set as the number of game player IDs participating in the league competition. After determining the match up results the second match up executing unit records the match up results in the first season of the league competition into the league competition database and simultaneously records rankings of the game player IDs based on the match up results in the first season of the league competition into the ranking database Step S . Subsequently the notifying unit notifies to the communication terminals of the game players associated with the respective game player IDs participating in the league competition the match up results in the first season of the league competition and the rankings of the game player IDs at the point of time when the first season of the league competition is finished Step S . When a game player selects LEAGUE COMPETITION on the webpage as exemplified in the notification may be executed by displaying on the game player s communication terminal the website containing the match up results in the first season of the league competition and the ranking of the game player ID of the game player at the point of time when the first season of the league competition is finished.

On the next day at a clock time when the second season of the league competition is started the aforementioned processing in Steps S to S is similarly executed. In this case opponents of a player character of a given game player ID are preferably all different from the opponents of the player character in the first season of the league competition. Next in Step S the second match up executing unit records the results of the match ups in the second season of the league competition in the league competition database and further records rankings of the game player IDs in the ranking database based on the results of all the match ups in the league competition so far i.e. the first and second seasons of the league competition in this case . The processing will be similarly executed for the third and subsequent seasons of the league competition.

When the fifth season of the league competition is finished data of all the results of the match ups in the respective first to fifth seasons of the league competition are reliably recorded in the league competition database whereas the rankings of game player IDs at the point of time when the fifth season of the league competition is finished i.e. in consideration of the results of the match ups in the first to fifth seasons of the league competition are reliably recorded in the ranking database .

When the first to fifth seasons of the league competition are held for five days from Monday to Friday as illustrated in a game player is allowed to access through the web service to be provided from the game server everyday the results of match ups of a player character associated with his her game player ID in each season of the league competition and the ranking of his her game player ID at the point of time of access by performing an appropriate operation of the communication terminal .

Now the relation between the individual competition i.e. the first match up and the league competition i.e. the second match up will be explained with reference to . As described above the league competition is started and executed at a fixed clock time everyday for five days from Monday to Friday. By contrast the individual competition is configured to be held in response to a game player s operational input at the communication terminal . Therefore the individual competition and the league competition are progressed independently from each other. When ability values of a player character associated with a given game player ID is herein updated in accordance with a result of the individual competition a match up is executed based on the updated ability values in the next league competition to be held after the updating. A case is herein assumed in which a player character associated with a given game player ID wins the individual competition on Monday i.e. a day when the first season of the league competition is held as illustrated in and the ability values of the player character are accordingly increased. In this case the player character associated with the given game player ID plays the match up using the enhanced ability values in the second season of the league competition on the next day i.e. Tuesday . In each of the arrowed lines indicates relation between the individual competition and the league competition of one of the seasons in which ability values of a player character updated as a result of the individual competition are reflected.

Therefore the baseball game will motivate each game player to enhance ability values of a player character by making the player character win the match ups of the individual competitions as many as possible in order to obtain a better result in the league competition in which many game players participate. Each game player is herein required to operate the communication terminal only in the individual competition. With a simple operation each game player can feel a sense of playing not only the match up of the individual competition but also the match up in the next league competition in which updated ability values of the player character are reflected. The result of the league competition is herein notified to each game player s communication terminal . Therefore each game player can get the result of the league competition after the individual competition. In other words each game player can recognize as the result of the league competition the effect of the enhanced ability values of a player character in the individual competition. Thus each game player naturally expects notification of the result of the league competition. Therefore the video game can realize a highly amusing match up game for allowing a game player to play the game with a simple operation of the communication terminal without getting the game player bored. Further a player character having abilities enhanced as a result of the individual competition is configured to play the league competition that is different from the individual competition. Therefore each game player can feel a game element as if a player character were nurtured in the individual competition and the nurtured player character were sent to the league competition. Additionally in the present configuration each game player is required to perform an operation only in the individual competition and the league competition is automatically progressed in parallel to the individual competition. Thus the video game is speedily progressed and is thereby suitable as social games or the like requiring a simple operation and a quick play result.

A second exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be hereinafter explained. Unless particularly mentioned the following exemplary embodiment and its modifications are basically similar to the first exemplary embodiment regarding the structures and actions of the communication terminal and the game server the respective units i.e. functions to be executed by the game control device and the main processing flow in the baseball game.

As illustrated in a database server of the present exemplary embodiment is different from the database server see in that a promotion demotion competition database is herein additionally provided. As illustrated in each game player ID is associated with a class in the player database . In the example of a game player ID of 000001 is associated with the class .

In the present exemplary embodiment each game player ID is associated with any one of a plurality of classes. It is herein possible to arbitrarily set class categories. For example it is possible to set hierarchical class categories from a beginner class or a novice class e.g. class to a master class or a senior class e.g. class . Further each game player plays the baseball game of the present exemplary embodiment for promoting his her game player ID to a higher ranked class in addition to the game element explained in the first exemplary embodiment. It should be noted that class updating changing of a class to be executed in a promotion demotion competition can include promotion to a higher ranked class demotion to a lower ranked class and maintenance of the status quo i.e. remaining in the same class .

The third match up executing unit is configured to automatically execute a promotion demotion competition i.e. a third match up between player characters associated with different unique game player IDs without an operational input at the communication terminal and determine a result of the promotion demotion competition based on the ability values of the player characters stored in the storage unit i.e. the player database of the database server in the present exemplary embodiment . In short the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up is a type of match up held between a given game player having a game player ID and an opponent having another game player ID on the background i.e. in parallel to the other type of match up similarly to the league competition i.e. the second match up .

The promotion demotion competition to be executed by the third match up executing unit is configured to be held at a predetermined clock time e.g. clock time set by the timer embedded in the game server . All the game player IDs may be configured to participate in the promotion demotion competition. Alternatively only some of the game player IDs desiring to participate in the promotion demotion competition may be configured to participate in the promotion demotion competition. Further the schedule of the promotion demotion competition may be arbitrarily set. For example the promotion demotion competition may be held between two consecutive league competitions.

Similarly to the first match up executing unit the third match up executing unit may be configured to execute a method of determining win loss of a match up. In other words any method can be herein employed as long as ability values of player characters affect win loss of a match up in the method.

The third match up executing unit is configured to record a result of the promotion demotion competition. As the third match up executing unit the CPU of the game server is specifically configured to access the database server and write the result of the promotion demotion competition in the promotion demotion competition database stored in the database server

The class managing unit is configured to manage each game player ID associated with any one of a plurality of classes. Further the class managing unit is configured to determine which of the following options should be executed based on the result of the promotion demotion competition promotion of the present class of each game player ID to a higher ranked class demotion of the present class of each game player ID to a lower ranked class and maintaining unchanging the present class of each game player ID.

As the class managing unit the CPU of the game server is specifically configured to access the database server read out the result of the promotion demotion competition stored in the promotion demotion competition database and determine which of the following options should be executed based on the read out result of the promotion demotion competition promotion of the present class of each game player ID to a higher ranked class demotion of the present class of each game player ID to a lower ranked class and unchanging maintaining the present class of each game player ID. Any suitable method can be employed as a method of updating a class based on a result of the promotion demotion competition. For example it is herein possible to apply a predetermined promotion demotion criterion preliminarily set for a result of the promotion demotion competition. For example the criterion may be set as follows. The present class is promoted to an immediately higher class when the winning rate is greater than or equal to 0.700 in match ups in the promotion demotion competition. Further the present class is demoted to an immediately lower class when the winning rate is less than or equal to 0.300 in match ups in the promotion demotion competition. Yet further the present class may be maintained when the winning rate is greater than 0.300 and less than 0.700 in match ups in the promotion demotion competition.

When determining a new updated class for each game player ID the class managing unit is configured to assign a new class to each game player ID. As the class managing unit the CPU of the game server is specifically configured to access the database server and write the new class for each game player ID in the player database .

In the present exemplary embodiment when recognizing that LEAGUE COMPETITION is selected on the webpage illustrated in for instance the CPU of the game server as the notifying unit is configured to transmit the HTML data to each game player s communication terminal for allowing it to display the webpage containing the results of match ups in the promotion demotion competition as well as the results of match ups in the immediate league competition and or a game player ID based ranking based on the results of match ups in a single or plurality of league competitions either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times. illustrates an exemplary webpage to be disposed on the communication terminal as a result of interpretation of the HTML data. Compared to the webpage illustrated in the exemplary webpage of additionally displays results of match ups in the promotion demotion competition and result of the class updating in the display field of the league competition result. illustrates an exemplary case in which a given game player ID is promoted to an immediately higher class as a result of the promotion demotion competition held last week 18 wins and 6 losses but is demoted to an immediately lower class as a result of the promotion demotion competition held this week 3 wins and 7 losses .

Similarly to the league competition i.e. the second match up the notifying unit is herein preferably configured to preliminarily notify each game player s communication terminal of the clock time in the real world when the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up is started.

Next an exemplary processing flow of the promotion demotion competition of the baseball game of the present exemplary embodiment will be hereinafter explained with reference to a flowchart of . is a flowchart for representing the processing of executing the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up .

The processing of executing the promotion demotion competition will be hereinafter explained with reference to . The processing will be herein explained based on an exemplary case as illustrated in in which the league competition is held for five days from Monday to Friday and the promotion demotion competition is then held on Saturday in the same week. It is herein preferable to start the promotion demotion competition at a fixed clock time preliminarily notified to each game player for instance at three o clock in the afternoon on Saturday in the real world.

As represented in the third match up executing unit is activated at the clock time on Saturday when the promotion demotion competition is held YES Step S . The third match up executing unit is automatically executed without a game player s operational input at the communication terminal . In executing the promotion demotion competition the third match up executing unit determines the match up combinations in the promotion demotion competition i.e. combinations of match ups between a player character associated with a given game player ID and player characters of a predetermined number of the other game player IDs Step S . When determining the match up combinations the third match up executing unit then refers to the player database and determines results of the match ups based on the ability values of the game players i.e. so that difference of the ability values of the player characters can affect win loss in the match ups Step S . When determining the results of the match ups in the promotion demotion competition the third match up executing unit records the results in the promotion demotion competition database .

Next the class managing unit updates a class of each game player ID based on the preliminarily set criterion Step S . The class managing unit herein refers to the results of the match ups in the promotion demotion competition recorded in the promotion demotion competition database and determines a new class of each game player ID using the aforementioned criterion. The class managing unit then records the new class of each game player ID in the player database . Next the notifying unit notifies the results of the match ups in the promotion demotion competition and the result of the class updating to the communication terminal of each game player having a unique game player ID Step S . It should be noted that the notification can be executed by causing the communication terminal to display a webpage containing the result of the promotion demotion competition as well as the result of the league competition for instance when each game player selects LEAGUE COMPETITION on the webpage exemplified in .

With reference to the relation between the individual competition i.e. the first match up and the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up will be hereinafter explained. is a diagram obtained by further adding a progression aspect of the promotion demotion competition to . represents a case in which the league competition is held for five days from Monday to Friday and the promotion demotion competition is held on Saturday in the same week.

In this case the promotion demotion competition is started and executed at a fixed clock time on Saturday. By contrast the individual competition is executed in response to a game player s operational input at the communication terminal . Therefore the individual competition and the promotion demotion competition are progressed independently from each other. When ability values of a player character associated with a given game player ID is herein updated in accordance with a result of a match up of the individual competition a match up is held based on the updated ability values in the promotion demotion competition to be held after the ability updating. For example a case is herein assumed in which a player character associated with a given game player ID plays and wins the individual competition and the ability values of the player character are accordingly increased on Friday i.e. the day when the fifth season of the league competition is held as illustrated in . In this case the player character associated with the given game player ID plays match ups using the enhanced ability values in the promotion demotion competition on the next day i.e. Saturday . In each of the arrowed lines indicates relation between the individual competition and either one of the seasons of the league competition or the promotion demotion competition in which ability values of a player character updated as a result of the individual competition are reflected.

In the game control device of the present exemplary embodiment a game player ID of each game player is associated with any one of a plurality of classes. Each game player having a unique game player ID experiences change of his her ranked class depending on a result of the promotion demotion competition. Therefore the game control device of the present exemplary embodiment motivates each game player to make his her player character win the promotion demotion competition for upgrading the class of his her game player ID to a higher class. On the other hand the promotion demotion competition is configured to be automatically held without an operational input at the communication terminal . Therefore each game player is not required to perform any operation with respect to the communication terminal in executing the promotion demotion competition. As described above however the ability values of a player character are updated based on the result of a match up of the individual competition and the promotion demotion competition is held by the player character with the updated ability values. From the standpoint of each game player the result of a match up of the individual competition indirectly affects the result of the match up in the promotion demotion competition. Thus each game player can feel a sense of executing not only the individual competition but also the league competition and further the promotion demotion competition only by executing an operational input regarding the individual competition into the communication terminal .

In the present exemplary embodiment each game player is motivated to achieve a better result not only in the league competition but also in the promotion demotion competition to be held after the league competition. In other words the game control device reliably motivates each game player to make his her player character win match ups of the individual competition as much as possible and thereby increase the ability values of his her player character in order to achieve a better result in the promotion demotion competition and upgrade the present class to a higher class. Each game player is herein only required to perform an operation regarding the individual competition with respect to the communication terminal . With such a simple operation each game player can feel a sense of executing not only the individual competition but also the league competition and further the promotion demotion competition. As exemplified in the result of the promotion demotion competition is herein preferably configured to be notified to each game player s communication terminal . In this case each game player is allowed to know the result of the promotion demotion competition after the individual competition and the league competition. In other words each game player is also allowed to know as the result of the promotion demotion competition an effect of enhancement of the ability values of his her player character in the individual competition. Therefore each game player naturally expects notification of the result of the promotion demotion competition. Consequently the game control device can realize a highly amusing match up game for allowing a game player to play the video game with a simple operation without getting the game player bored.

Some preferable modifications for the first and or second exemplary embodiment s will be hereinafter explained. It should be noted that a given modification for one of the first and second exemplary embodiments can be obviously applied as a modification of the other of the first and second exemplary embodiments. Without particularly mentioned each modification is basically the same as the aforementioned respective exemplary embodiments regarding the configuration and actions of the communication terminal and the game server respective units to be executed by the game control device and the main processing flow of the baseball game.

In the first exemplary embodiment and or the second exemplary embodiment the character ability updating unit may employ the aforementioned ENHANCEMENT of a player character i.e. a method of enhancing a player character by integrating a plurality of player characters as a method of updating the ability of a player character. Enhancement of a player character i.e. the integration processing for player characters may be executed as follows.

In a modification 1 the first match up executing unit is herein configured to give enhanced points i.e. points for ability updating to a game player ID associated with a winning player character in the individual competition i.e. the first match up . The character ability updating unit is then configured to consume the predetermined amount of enhanced points in accordance with a predetermined game player s operation e.g. the operation of selecting ENHANCEMENT in for integrating a plurality of player characters already possessed by the game player i.e. player characters associated with the game player ID corresponding to the game player . For example the integration processing may be executed as follows. A player character A hereinafter simply referred to as a player A is herein set as a player character as an enhancement target i.e. a player character specified by a game player as a player character to be left after the integration processing while a player character B hereinafter simply referred to as a player B is herein set as a player character to be integrated with the player A and disappear after the integration. In the integration processing the CPU may be herein configured to calculate ability values of a new player A by adding a predetermined ratio of the value of each ability item i.e. batting ability running ability fielding ability of the player B to the value of the corresponding ability item i.e. batting ability running ability fielding ability of the player A. Through the integration processing ability features of the player B are reflected in the player A. After the integration processing the CPU is configured to delete the data of the player B from the data of the target game player ID. It should be noted that the enhancement points associated with each game player ID is stored in the player database as the data to be cumulatively increased every time a corresponding player character wins the individual competition i.e. the first match up . After the integration processing the CPU is configured to access the player database and reduce the enhancement points of each game player ID by a predetermined amount.

In the aforementioned exemplary case a predetermined ratio of each ability value i.e. the value of each ability item of the player B is added to the corresponding ability value i.e. the value of the corresponding ability item of the player A as a method of calculating new ability values of the player A. However the method of calculating new ability values of the player A is not limited to the above. For example comprehensive ability level data may be prepared for each player character and ability updating may be executed based on the comprehensive ability level data.

An exemplary screen to be displayed on the communication terminal regarding the aforementioned integration processing of player characters will be hereinafter explained with reference to . are exemplary screens to be sequentially displayed in response to an operation of the communication terminal .

When recognizing that ENHANCEMENT is selected on the webpage illustrated in for instance the CPU of the game server is configured to transmit the HTML data to the communication terminal for allowing it to display a webpage to prompt a game player to select a plurality of player characters as integration targets. As illustrated in an exemplary webpage to be herein firstly displayed is a list of enhancement specified players i.e. player characters as enhancement targets . A game player is herein allowed to select an enhancement specified player on the webpage illustrated in by performing a scrolling operation and pressing the confirmation button. When the enhancement specified player is selected a list of players to be integrated i.e. player characters configured to disappear after integration is then configured to be displayed as illustrated in . A game player is herein allowed to select at least a player to be integrated with the enhancement specified player on the webpage illustrated in by performing a scrolling operation and pressing the confirmation button. is a confirmation screen illustrating an exemplary case in which the player A is selected as an enhancement specified player and the player B is selected as a player to be integrated with the player A. When an operation of selecting a menu of ENHANCE is herein performed the result of the selection operation is transmitted to the game server . Based on the received result of the selection operation the CPU of the game server is configured to calculate new ability values of the player A and access the player database for deleting the data of the player B from the data of the corresponding game player ID. The CPU is then configured to transmit the HTML data containing a value indicting a level of increase in the new ability values to the communication terminal . In response to receipt of the HTML data the communication terminal is configured to display a rendition that cards of the players A and B are overlapped and integrated and then only the card of the player A is displayed as illustrated in . As illustrated in FIG. E it is preferable to quantitatively display the level of increase in the ability values of the player A as the enhancement target 132 in the example of .

The modification has the following remarkable feature. A result of the individual competition i.e. the first match up is configured to affect a result of the league competition i.e. the second match up to be held in parallel to the individual competition and further the result of the league competition i.e. the second match up is configured to affect enhancement of the ability of the team of a game player by enriching the function of DRAWING explained with reference to . With the configuration getting a better result in the individual competition i.e. the first match up results in enhancement of the ability of a player character and further contributes to addition of either more various types of player characters or player characters with higher abilities to a game player s team. Thus team ability can be also enhanced. Further when a player character can be added the added player character can be integrated with respect to a given player character in order to enhance the ability of the given player character as described in the modification 1. This realizes a profound game element.

The player character drawing unit has a function of selecting one from the group of a plurality of player characters via a lottery draw based on a game player s operation and causing the storage unit to store the selected player character in association with a corresponding game player ID. It should be noted that the lottery drawing function of the player character drawing unit is different from DRAWING of that the number of times allowed for lottery draws per day is limited. The function of the player character drawing unit is realized as follows. The ROM of the game server stores a group of a plurality of player characters as a parent organization for lottery draws. When recognizing a game player s operational input regarding a lottery draw corresponding to the player character drawing unit the CPU is configured to access the group data stored in the ROM randomly select a player character and store the selected player character in association with the corresponding game player ID in the player database .

The lottery draw item giving unit has a function of giving a game player more tickets i.e. items for drawing in accordance with better results of match ups in the league competition i.e. the second match up such as a better final ranking of the five seasons from Monday to Friday. For example a predetermined number of tickets are given to a game player in accordance with the final ranking of the five seasons from Monday to Friday and the given tickets are cumulated unless being used. The storage unit is herein configured to store the number of tickets given to each game player on a game player ID basis. The function of the lottery draw item giving unit is realized when the CPU accesses the league competition database obtains the data of the results of the match ups in the league competition and calculates the number of tickets to be given to a game player in accordance with the data. The following is an exemplary relation between the results of the match ups in the league competition and the number of tickets to be given to a game player. It should be herein noted that a ranking is set as a ranking within each class.

The drawing setting unit has a function of setting the number of times allowed for lottery draws by the player character drawing unit on a game player ID basis to be increased in accordance with better results of match ups in the league competition i.e. the second match up . For example when a player character is assumed to be selected from the group of a plurality of player characters such as title holders home run king a rookie of the year etc. more tickets are configured to be given to a game player in accordance with better results of the match ups in the league competition i.e. the second match up . Therefore it is possible to set the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders to be increased by that much. For example the function of the drawing setting unit can be herein realized as follows. The CPU of the game server causes the player database to preliminarily store the cumulative value of the number of tickets to be given to a specific game player ID and determines i.e. set the number of times allowed for lottery draws with reference to the cumulative value. It is herein required to set the cumulative value of the number of tickets to be roughly proportional to the number of times allowed for lottery draws. For example when 10 tickets have been cumulated so far i.e. the cumulative value of the number of tickets is 10 the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders is set to be once. When 20 tickets have been cumulated so far on the other hand the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders is set to be twice.

According to the present modification results of the match ups in the league competition i.e. the second match up also affects chances of obtaining player characters via lottery draws i.e. the number of times allowed for lottery draws . In other words a result of the match up of the individual competition i.e. the first match up affects not only results of the match ups in the league competition but also indirectly the chances of obtaining player characters via lottery draws. From the standpoint of each game player double gains can be obtained depending on a result of the match up of the individual competition. It is thereby possible to realize a fun game full of amusement.

In the game server two or more groups may be prepared as lottery draw targets for the ROM in order to make lottery draws diverse. In this case the player character drawing unit may be configured to select a player character from a first group of a plurality of player characters and or a second group of a plurality of player characters different from those in the first group via a lottery draw based on a game player s operation and to cause the storage unit to store the selected player character in association with a corresponding game player ID.

For example it is possible to set a group of a plurality of player characters as the best nine of the year i.e. the second group in addition to the aforementioned group of title holders i.e. the first group . The group of the best nine of the year includes a plurality of player characters respectively having a higher ability i.e. player characters functioning advantageously for a game player in a match up than that of the respective player characters in the group of title holders. In this case when 20 tickets have been cumulated so far the drawing setting unit may be configured to set the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders to be twice and set the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of the best nine of the year to be once. Thus the drawing setting unit herein has a function of causing the storage unit to store the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the second group by the player character drawing unit in association with a corresponding game player ID when the number of tickets stored in the storage unit in association with the corresponding game player ID by the function of the lottery draw item giving unit is greater than or equal to a predetermined number.

When two or more groups are prepared as lottery draw targets and a lottery draw is available from the groups i.e. when the number of times allowed for lottery draws is once or more with respect to two or more groups a game player may be allowed to select any one of the groups as the lottery draw targets. For example either of the following options may be selected by a game player. One is that a game player executes a lottery draw from the group of title holders when 10 tickets are cumulated. The other is that a game player further saves tickets and executes a lottery draw from the group of best nine of the year when 20 tickets are cumulated.

As described above in the second modification 2 lottery draws are available from either the group of title holders or the group of best nine of the year through the collection of a predetermined number of items for drawing. In other words a single type of item is prepared as the lottery draw item to be collected. Alternatively it is possible to assume a configuration of preparing a plurality of types of items as the items for drawing. Specifically two types of items such as tickets for a lottery draw from the group of title holders and tickets for a lottery draw from the group of best nine of the year may be prepared as the items for drawing to be given to game players in accordance with a result of the second match up. For example game players can get a ticket for a lottery draw from the group of best nine of the year when being ranked within top 30 in the ranking as a result of the second match up. Further game players can get a ticket for a lottery draw from the group of title holders when being ranked within top 70 in the ranking as a result of the second match up.

In the aforementioned example the number of tickets allowed for lottery draws is determined based on the final ranking of a single league competition i.e. the second match up including five seasons from Monday to Friday. However the number of tickets allowed for lottery draws may be alternatively determined based on values except for the final ranking. For example an evaluation value may be calculated for each game player in accordance with a result of the league competition and the number of tickets lottery draw items may be configured to be determined in accordance with the magnitude of the evaluation value. For example the evaluation value can be assumed to be obtained by converting a winning rate into point as follows.

15 wins and 10 losses . . . 600 points i.e. a value obtained by multiplying the winning rate by 1000 

10 wins and 15 losses . . . 400 points i.e. a value obtained by multiplying the winning rate by 1000 

For example the number of tickets to be given to the aforementioned evaluation value may be set as follows.

Further in the aforementioned case a predetermined number of items for drawing are firstly collected depending on a result of the league competition i.e. the second match up and then a lottery draw is executed using the predetermined number of items. However a lottery draw may be configured to be directly executed without intervention of the items for drawing. In other words lottery draws may be configured to be executed from either the group of title holders or the group of best nine of the year at a predetermined number of times in accordance with a result of the league competition i.e. the second match up . In this case the drawing setting unit may set the number of times allowed for lottery draws by the player character drawing unit to be increased in accordance with a better result of the second match up i.e. in accordance with a better order in the ranking or a higher evaluation value . For example the number of times allowed for lottery draws may be set as follows.

Within top 30 in the total rankings . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of best nine of the year twice

Within top 50 in the total rankings . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of best nine of the year once

Within top one tenth in the total rankings . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders twice

Within top one fifth in the total rankings . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders once

In this example the number of times allowed for lottery draws may be set based on the magnitude of the evaluation value in accordance with a result of the league competition i.e. the second match up similarly to the aforementioned example. For example the number of times allowed for lottery draws may be set as follows.

950 points or more . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of best nine of the year twice

900 points or more . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of best nine of the year once

800 points or more . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders twice

750 points or more . . . the number of times allowed for lottery draws from the group of title holders once

In the aforementioned modification the first group i.e. the aforementioned group of title holders and the second group i.e. the aforementioned group of best nine of the year are prepared as two parent groups for lottery draws i.e. one group of plural player characters and the other group of plural player characters different from those in the former group. A single or plurality of chances for lottery draws i.e. at least once of the number of times allowed for lottery draws from one of the groups i.e. the second group are given to a game player in accordance with a result of the league competition. In other words it is possible to provide a game setting of changing the parent group for lottery draws in accordance with a result of the league competition. Accordingly the video game can be diversified.

Further in the aforementioned modification a chance of lottery draw is not directly given to a game player based on a result of the league competition. Instead a game player firstly collects items for drawing the number of which to be given is determined depending on a result of the league competition. Then a single or plurality of chances i.e. at least once of the number of times allowed for lottery draws are given to the game player when a predetermined number or more of the items for drawing are collected. In other words an object for getting a chance of lottery draw i.e. collecting a predetermined number of items for drawing is set until a lottery draw becomes available for a game player. A game player is thus motivated to achieve the object. This can further enhance a game element.

It should be noted that the number of times allowed for lottery draws could be zero. In other words no chance of lottery draw may be given to a game player in accordance with a result of the league competition.

In the aforementioned example when two groups are prepared as target groups for lottery draw the second group i.e. the aforementioned group of best nine of the year includes player characters respectively having a higher ability i.e. player characters functioning advantageously for a game player in a match up than that of the respective player characters in the first group i.e. the aforementioned group of title holders . According to the configuration each game player is motivated to collect items for drawing as much as possible by achieving a better result of the league competition i.e. the second match up make a lottery draw from the second group available by the player character drawing unit and thereby make the future match ups advantageous. As described above a result of a match up of the individual competition i.e. the first match up affects a result of a match up in the league competition. Therefore each game player is also indirectly motivated to achieve a better result of a match up of the individual competition.

It should be noted that the second group may be formed by player characters respectively having a lower appearance rate i.e. rare player characters than that for the respective player characters in the first group. Here appearance rate is relating to probability of drawing a player character. Specifically the player characters in the second group may be set as rarely obtainable player characters respectively having lower ability values than those of the respective player characters in the first group. For example it can be assumed that either retired baseball players in the real world or popular but incompetent baseball players are set as the rarely obtainable player characters.

In this case a game player is motivated to collect tickets items for drawing as much as possible by achieving better results in match ups of the league competition i.e. the second match up make a lottery draw from the second group available by the player character drawing unit and obtain a rarely appearing player character via a lottery draw. As described above a result of a match up of the individual competition affects results of match ups in the league competition. Therefore each game player is also indirectly motivated to achieve a better result in a match up of the individual competition.

Another modification of the first exemplary embodiment will be hereinafter explained. In the first exemplary embodiment associated with a result of a match up of the individual competition i.e. the first match up configured to be executed based on a game player s operational input at the communication terminal is configured to be reflected to the league competition i.e. the second match up configured to be executed on the background of i.e. in parallel to the individual competition on the next day of the individual competition i.e. the first match up . However the reflecting timing may be set as follows.

For example results of a plurality of match ups of the individual competitions i.e. the first match up to be held in a single day may be reflected to the league competition to be held in the same day. In other words the league competition i.e. the second match up is configured to be held in non synchronization with the individual competition i.e. the first match up . The results of the match ups of the individual competitions i.e. the first match up are reflected to a subsequent league competition i.e. the second match up . Specifically a plurality of seasons of the league competition may be preliminarily set in a single day and results of match ups of the individual competitions i.e. the first match up executed before each league competition may be reflected to an immediately subsequent league competition i.e. the second match up . The player database immediately stores ability updating to be executed for each player character based on a result of a match up of the individual competition. Therefore the updated ability is reflected to the subsequent league competition even in the same day.

Further when ENHANCEMENT of a player character i.e. a method of enhancing a player character by integrating a plurality of player characters is herein employed and the ENHANCEMENT is executed before each league competition a result of ENHANCEMENT may be reflected to an immediately subsequent league competition. In other words a player character for which ENHANCEMENT is executed before a given league competition is configured to be used in the given league competition. By contrast when ENHANCEMENT is executed after a plurality of league competitions are held influence of match ups of the individual competitions i.e. the first match up held in the meantime may be collectively reflected to the ability of a player character and the player character is configured to be used in an immediately subsequent league competition. According to the present modification a result of the individual competition is quickly reflected to the league competition i.e. the second match up . Therefore a speedy fun game can be realized.

Yet another modification of the first exemplary embodiment will be hereinafter explained. The aforementioned modification 1 exemplifies the case in which the first match up executing unit is configured to give enhancement points ability updating points to a game player ID associated with a winner player character in the individual competition i.e. the first match up as an ability updating method of updating the ability of a player character in response to a game player s operation of the communication terminal. Further the processing of integrating a plurality of player characters already possessed by a game player is configured to be executed in return for consuming a predetermined mount of enhancement points in response to a predetermined game player s operation e.g. the operation of selecting ENHANCEMENT in . However the following modification may be further added to the first exemplary embodiment.

Specifically separate enhancement points i.e. the second ability updating points to a game player ID as a winner in the league competition i.e. the second match up may be given in addition to the enhancement points i.e. the first ability updating points to a game player ID as a winner in the individual competition i.e. the first match up . In other words the second match up executing unit may be configured to give enhancement points to a game player ID associated with a winning player character in the league competition i.e. the second match up . The first ability updating points and the second ability updating points are respectively cumulated and stored in the player database on a game player ID basis. The first ability updating points and the second ability updating points may be independently managed stored or alternatively collectively managed stored as common ability updating points. In the modification each game player can receive benefit of obtaining two types of points in a single individual competition. Therefore a fun game full of amusement can be realized. Further each game player can obtain enhancement points in accordance with a result of the league competition although each game player does not directly get involved in the league competition. From the standpoint of each game player not only a result of the individual competition affects the league competition but also a result of the league competition can also contribute to ability updating for a player character. Further the ability updating for a player character can affect the subsequent individual competition. Therefore it is possible to realize a fun and profound game element of allowing each game player to obtain a plurality of results based on a single match up.

Enhancement points i.e. the first ability updating points are herein configured to be given to a game player when the game player wins the individual competition. Alternatively regardless of win or loss predetermined enhancement points may be configured to be given to a game player when the game player executes the individual competition. When the game player wins the individual competition more enhancement points may be configured to be additionally given to the game player. The league competition is configured to be automatically executed regardless of game player s intention. Therefore enhancement points i.e. the second ability updating points may be configured to be given to a game player only when the game player wins the league competition.

It should be noted that the enhancement points obtainable in the individual competition i.e. the first ability updating points and the enhancement points obtainable in the league competition i.e. the second ability updating points can be used for integrating a plurality of player characters and can be set in a variety of units and manners. Suppose the both types of enhancement points are set as the same unit the amount of enhancement points to be given and the amount of enhancement points to be consumed may be set as follows based on a variety of opinions with respect to the game setting. It should be noted that the first match up executing unit and the second match up executing unit may set the amount of enhancement points to be given while the character ability updating unit may set the amount of enhancement points to be consumed.

It is possible to substantially change the influential level of a result of the individual competition and that of a result of the league competition with respect to updating of the ability of a player character by differently setting the given consumed amount of enhancement points obtainable in the individual competition i.e. the first ability updating points and that of enhancement points obtainable in the league competition i.e. the second ability updating points . Accordingly the video game can be more diversified.

In a setting 1 the amount of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the league competition i.e. the second ability updating points is set to be less than that of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the individual competition i.e. the first ability updating points . This is because weight of game player s direct involvement in the individual competition which is a positive aspect of the game is relatively reduced when the both types of enhancement points are set to be identical to each other. The setting is based on the concept that the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the league competition play an auxiliary role for deepening amusement of the game element. When a result of a match up without game player s direct involvement is greatly valued weight of a game player s operation is reduced and a factor without game player s direct involvement contributes to ability updating for a player character which may cause the entire game balance to be lost. As a setting example enhancement points obtainable for winning in the league competition may be set to be 15 points while enhancement points obtainable for winning in the individual competition may be set to be 30 points. Thus the amount of the enhancement points obtainable in the league competition may be set to be half that of the enhancement points obtainable in the individual competition.

In a setting 2 contrary to the setting 1 the amount of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the league competition i.e. the second ability updating points is set to be greater than that of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the individual competition i.e. the first ability updating points . In this case the amount of the enhancement points obtainable in the league competition without game player s direct involvement is greater than that of the enhancement points obtainable in the individual competition. Therefore each game player may herein experience an unexpected situation. Specifically each game player has chances of unexpectedly obtaining enhancement points greater than enhancement points obtained in the respective individual competition. Accordingly an unpredictable game full of amusement can be realized.

In a setting 3 the amount of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the individual competition i.e. the first ability updating points is set to be identical to that of the enhancement points obtainable as a result of the league competition i.e. the second ability updating points . However the amount of the second ability updating points may be set to be greater than that of the first ability updating points when being consumed as the enhancement points for integrating a plurality of player characters. In an exemplary case of integrating a player character B with respect to a player character A 500 points may be required when the first ability updating points are consumed for the character integration as the conventional enhancement points. On the other hand 1 000 points may be required when the second ability updating points are consumed for the character integration. Thus the consumed points for the second ability updating points may be set to be double those for the first ability updating points. According to the setting greater points are configured to be consumed from the enhancement points obtained as a result of the league competition without game player s direct involvement. In other words weight of the individual competition is relatively increased similarly to the aforementioned setting 1. Therefore the entire game balance cannot be easily lost.

In a setting 4 contrary to the setting 3 less point may be consumed from the second ability updating points than from the first ability updating points when being consumed as the enhancement points for integrating a plurality of player characters. From the standpoint of each game player the enhancement points obtainable in the league competition without game player s direct involvement can be more effectively used in updating the ability of a corresponding player character. Therefore each game player can feel a kind of sense of gaining profit. Together with such a fun gambling aspect a video game with amusement can be realized. It should be noted that a game player may be allowed to select either of the first ability updating points and the second ability updating points as target points to be consumed. Alternatively the first ability updating points may be configured to be automatically consumed first and then the second ability updating points may be configured to be consumed for offsetting a shortage of required points on an as needed basis.

Settings of opponents in the aforementioned promotion demotion competition are not particularly limited. For example the promotion demotion competition may be held by opponent game player IDs classified in classes with greatly different levels. However amusement of the video game can be further enhanced by executing the aforementioned promotion demotion competition in tandem with the league competition and by limiting a match up opponent in the subsequent promotion demotion competition in accordance with results of match ups in the league competition.

More specifically the second match up executing unit is configured to execute the league competition among player characters associated with game player IDs classified in the same class. On the other hand the third match up executing unit is configured to determine a class of a game player ID as an opponent of a given game player ID in the promotion demotion competition based on results of match ups in a single or plurality of league competitions either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times. In determining an opponent in the league competition the CPU of the game server as second match up executing unit is herein configured to refer to the player database extract only game player IDs classified in the same class and determine an opponent from the extracted game player IDs. Further the CPU of the game server as the third match up executing unit is configured to refer to the league competition database in determining a class of an opponent i.e. a game player ID in the promotion demotion competition. In other words the result of the league competition held within the same class is configured to affect subsequent determination of an opponent in the promotion demotion competition.

In the modification any suitable method can be employed as a method of determining an opponent in the promotion demotion competition in order to attract game player s interest to results of match ups in the league competition. The following is an exemplary method of determining an opponent in the promotion demotion competition. Specifically when achieving a better result in the league competition a given game player ID is configured to be assigned a game player ID ranked higher than the given game player ID as an opponent in the promotion demotion competition. When achieving a poor result by contrast a given game player is configured to be assigned a game player ID ranked lower than the given game player ID as an opponent in the promotion demotion competition. With the configuration a game player ID having achieved a better result in the league competition can be promoted to a class higher than the present class thereof in the promotion demotion competition whereas a game player ID having achieved a poor result in the league competition can be demoted to a class lower than the present class thereof depending on a result in the promotion demotion competition. Thus the result of the league competition i.e. the second match up held within the same class is configured to affect determination of an opponent in the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up . Therefore competitive relations are established among game players within the same class. This induces game player s interest in the results of the league competition and amusement of the game can be thereby further enhanced.

A more specific aspect of the promotion demotion competition according to the present modification will be explained with reference to .

Further the following advantageous effects can be further achieved by the present aspect of the promotion demotion competition. In the aforementioned configuration all the game players are divided into two groups depending on a result of the league competition. One of the groups includes game players configured to play match ups with other game players classified in a higher class while the other of the groups includes game players configured to play match ups with other game players classified in a lower class. In this case all the game players are configured to play match ups in the promotion demotion competition without exception. However a given game player achieving a relatively poor result in the league competition is forced to play a match up with an opponent game player classified in a lower class. Further the given game player may be demoted to a lower class depending on a result of the match up. Thus it is possible to structure a system for providing each game player with a sense of tension. For the sake of explanation the following exemplary case is assumed in which totally 100 game players play the league competition where game players ranked in a higher ranking group i.e. 1st to 50th rankings are configured to play the promotion demotion competition with other game player classified in a higher class while game players ranked in a lower ranking group i.e. 51st to 100th rankings are configured to play the promotion demotion competition with other game players classified in a lower class. In this case a 50th ranked game player may be promoted to a class higher than his her present class thereof depending on a result of the match up with an opponent classified in a class higher than his her present class. In addition the 50th ranked game player at least has no chance of being demoted to a class lower than his her present class. However a 51st ranked game player may be demoted to a class lower than his her present class depending on a result of the match up with an opponent classified in a class lower than his her present class. Thus difference by one in rankings makes a big difference. Therefore each game player is motivated to achieve a better result as much as possible and avoid a situation of being forced to play a match up with an opponent classified in a lower class. As a result it is possible to realize a game for providing each game player with a sense of tension.

Yet another modification of the second exemplary embodiment will be hereinafter explained. In the second exemplary embodiment the notifying unit is configured to transmit the HTML data to the communication terminal for causing it to display the webpage containing the result of the promotion demotion competition in addition to the ranking of a corresponding game player ID based on results of match ups in the immediate league competition and or results of match ups in a single or plurality of league competitions either for a predetermined term in the past or at a predetermined number of times. illustrates an exemplary case in which a given game player ID was promoted to a class immediately higher than the as of then class thereof last week due to the last week s result of the match ups in the promotion demotion competition 18 wins and 6 losses but was demoted to a class immediately lower than the as of then class thereof this week due to this week s result of the match ups in the promotion demotion competition 3 wins and 7 losses . The configuration is intended to inform each game player of the result of the league competition. As a modification however the notifying unit may be configured to inform the communication terminal of information regarding prediction of a class to be set after the promotion demotion competition i.e. the third match up to be held after a league competition i.e. the second match up based on results of match ups in the league competition.

As explained in the modification 5 prior to the promotion demotion competition in the weekend see it is determined which of the groups each game player ID is ranked within each class i.e. either an upper ranked group or a lower ranked group depending on results of match ups in the seasons of the league competition from Monday to Friday. As a result an opponent i.e. either an opponent classified in a higher class or an opponent classified in a lower class in the promotion demotion competition is determined. In the promotion demotion competition a given game player ID can be promoted to a class higher than the present class thereof when wining a match up with an opponent classified in a class higher than the present class of the given game player ID but is left in its present class when losing the match up. On the other hand a given game player ID is demoted to a class lower than the present class thereof when losing a match up with an opponent classified in a class lower than the present class of the given game player ID but is left in its present class when winning the match up. In other words chances of promotion or demotion are revealed prior to execution of the promotion demotion competition. In the present modification as the information regarding prediction of a class to be set after the promotion demotion competition each game player is notified of information indicating that the game player ID of each game player is within a promotion range when having a chance of promotion and information indicating that the game player ID of each game player is within a demotion range when having a chance of demotion. When being notified of such information each game player learns chances of promotion and demotion prior to execution of the promotion demotion competition. Therefore each game player will wait for the result of the promotion demotion competition while being evoked a sense of psychological excitation. As a result amusement of the video game can be enhanced.

It should be noted that the notifying unit may be configured to notify the communication terminal of the information regarding prediction of a class as of now either after each match up in the league competition or every day from Monday to Friday without notifying it of the information after all the match ups in the seasons of the league competition from Monday to Friday are finished and then all the results are obtained. In this case once recognizing that a corresponding game player ID is included within the demotion range each game player tries to achieve a better result in the remaining match ups in the league competition towards promotion because his her game player ID has a chance of demotion in the next promotion demotion competition. In other words each game player aims at winning in the individual competition affecting a result of the league competition. Therefore each game player can be strongly motivated to actively play the video game.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been explained in detail. However the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned exemplary embodiments. Further it is apparent that a variety of changes and modifications can be made for the respective exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention.

In the aforementioned exemplary embodiments for instance the match up game is configured to be progressed through the webpage displayed by the web browser of each game player s communication terminal based on the web service provided from the game server. The configuration is advantageous in that each communication terminal is not required to download or install software for the game. However the method of executing the match up game is not limited to the aforementioned configuration. The match up game of the present exemplary embodiments can be executed by partially downloading or installing functions to be realized by the software for the game into each communication terminal.
