Many different types models and versions of complex communication devices are implemented at customer locations. These communication devices periodically require testing troubleshooting maintenance upgrading and other interactions. Often more than one type model or version of communication device is located at a particular location. Moreover each communication device may have a unique configuration and operating parameters. When performing testing troubleshooting maintaining upgrading or other procedures a technical support individual needs to know the precise configuration of each particular communication device. Further in order to correct problems or add or change functionality the technical support individual must be able to check the status of the communication device and if desired update the configuration of that communication device.

In many instances obtaining the precise configuration information of a particular communication device especially when the subject communication device is one of a number of communication devices at the same location requires that the technical support individual use a diagnostic device to connect directly to the subject communication device or access a separate database to obtain the subject communication device s configuration. Connecting directly to the communication device also has challenges such as clearing the customer s firewall and other connectivity issues. Further each of these tasks consumes valuable time and resources.

Therefore it would be desirable to have a convenient way of learning and accessing the configuration of a communication device that overcomes the above mentioned challenges.

Embodiments of a portable technical support device include a location determining element configured to allow the portable technical support device to be location aware and a communicating element configured to allow the portable technical support device to access a network management system the network management system having information relating to a communication device wherein the portable technical support device obtains from the management system the information relating to the communication device by making the network management system aware of the location of the communication device using the portable technical support device as a location determining element.

In block the portable device requests the configuration of the communication device from the management system .

In block the request is denied because the network management system has no configuration available for a communication device at the location established by the portable device .

In block the portable device is used to set the location of a communication device at the location established by the portable device by sending the location of the portable device to the network management system . The network management system uses the location and identifies the communication device . The communication device may be identified by several methods. These include but are not limited to serial number name MAC media access control address or any other identifying characteristics. Once the communication device is identified to the network management system the location of the communication device is stored within the database in the network management system .

In a Getting Current Location icon refers to the portable device establishing its current location using the location determining element . The icon communicates to a user that the status of the portable device is that it is determining its location and communicating with the network management system . In this example the portable device has communicated its location to the network management system and is awaiting notification of the presence of a communication device or a list of communication devices that are also at or near the current location of the portable device .

In the portable device illustrates that the network management system has identified in its database a communication device at or near the location at which the portable device is located. A window indicates a Found Device notification . In this example the Found Device is a communication device called Initech 7100. The nomenclature Initech 7100 refers to a model or type of communication device and is shown for example only. Each communication device is typically assigned a plain English designator to facilitate communication between users. It is easier to manually search for a name such as Initech 7100 rather than remembering and searching for an IP address a MAC address or other machine readable information. To access a representation of the configuration of the communication device e.g. Initech 7100 the user actuates the continue button .

In the portable device illustrates an alternative embodiment in that the network management system has identified in its database a number of communication devices located at or near the location at which the portable device is located. A window indicates a list of communication devices located at or near the location at which the portable device is located. To proceed with one of the devices in the window a user actuates one of the buttons associated with the selected communication device.

In the portable device illustrates that the user has actuated the button in . The icon refers to the communication device e.g. Initech 7100 the representation of the configuration of which is being accessed by the portable device . The display also shows a series of menu items under the icon . In this example the menu items include Jobs Users Phones Wireless Status Call Data and Network. In this example the Jobs menu item is illustrated as being selected by the user. The user activates the button to select the Jobs menu item. At this point at least a partial configuration of the communication device i.e. the Initech 7100 will have already been transmitted to the portable device along with basic communication device information such as for example name IP address and a subset of relevant statistics CPU usage heap space etc. this information being stored in the database .

In the portable device shows the Jobs menu item and further includes menu choices including Upgrade Firmware Restore Backup Restart Device and Preinstall Config . In the instant example of upgrading the firmware of the communication device the current firmware is given in the at least partial configuration . However when performing some tasks such as for example the Restore Backup task the portable device would request a list of saved states that have been stored on a backup server such as on the server implementing the network management system .

In the user has selected the Upgrade Firmware menu item . As a result the illustrative current firmware version is arbitrarily shown as A2 05 00. This makes the user of the portable device aware of the current firmware configuration of the communication device . A select firmware menu heading appears along with a window showing the firmware choices available for the communication device . The firmware choice illustratively shown as A4 01 03 is shown as being selected by the user and is therefore surrounded by a solid box instead of a dotted box. An Install Firmware button is shown to allow a user of the portable device to modify the configuration by selecting and updating the firmware to the selected firmware version . A modified configuration is saved and then forwarded uploaded or otherwise delivered to the network management system . The network management system then updates the configuration of the communication device using the modified configuration by running a script that instructs the communication device to download the new firmware from the network management system and then update its configuration to use the new firmware at the next reboot. In addition the current firmware is then set as the backup in case there is a problem with the new firmware. Typically this is followed by an immediate reboot of the communication device to begin using the new firmware.

While various embodiments of the invention have been described it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are within the scope of this invention.
