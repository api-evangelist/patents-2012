This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 257 499 filed Oct. 24 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The term product means any machine manufacture and or composition of matter unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term process means any process algorithm method or the like unless expressly specified otherwise.

Each process whether called a method algorithm or otherwise inherently includes one or more steps and therefore all references to a step or steps of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term process or a like term. Accordingly any reference in a claim to a step or steps of a process has sufficient antecedent basis.

The term invention and the like mean the one or more inventions disclosed in this application unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms an embodiment embodiment embodiments the embodiment the embodiments one or more embodiments some embodiments certain embodiments one embodiment another embodiment and the like mean one or more but not all embodiments of the disclosed invention s unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term variation of an invention means an embodiment of the invention unless expressly specified otherwise.

A reference to another embodiment in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment e.g. an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms including comprising and variations thereof mean including but not limited to unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term herein means in the present application including anything which may be incorporated by reference unless expressly specified otherwise.

The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the phrase at least one of a widget a car and a wheel means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel. The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things does not mean one of each of the plurality of things.

Numerical terms such as one two etc. when used as cardinal numbers to indicate quantity of something e.g. one widget two widgets mean the quantity indicated by that numerical term but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that numerical term. For example the phrase one widget does not mean at least one widget and therefore the phrase one widget does not cover e.g. two widgets.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on . The phrase based at least on is equivalent to the phrase based at least in part on .

The term represent and like terms are not exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the term represents do not mean represents only unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase the data represents a credit card number describes both the data represents only a credit card number and the data represents a credit card number and the data also represents something else .

The term whereby is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited. Thus when the term whereby is used in a claim the clause or other words that the term whereby modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.

The term e.g. and like terms mean for example and thus does not limit the term or phrase it explains. For example in the sentence the computer sends data e.g. instructions a data structure over the Internet the term e.g. explains that instructions are an example of data that the computer may send over the Internet and also explains that a data structure is an example of data that the computer may send over the Internet. However both instructions and a data structure are merely examples of data and other things besides instructions and a data structure can be data .

The term respective and like terms mean taken individually . Thus if two or more things have respective characteristics then each such thing has its own characteristic and these characteristics can be different from each other but need not be. For example the phrase each of two machines has a respective function means that the first such machine has a function and the second such machine has a function as well. The function of the first machine may or may not be the same as the function of the second machine.

The term i.e. and like terms mean that is and thus limits the term or phrase it explains. For example in the sentence the computer sends data i.e. instructions over the Internet the term i.e. explains that instructions are the data that the computer sends over the Internet.

Any given numerical range shall include whole and fractions of numbers within the range. For example the range 1 to 10 shall be interpreted to specifically include whole numbers between 1 and 10 e.g. 1 2 3 4 . . . 9 and non whole numbers e.g. 1.1 1.2 . . . 1.9 .

Where two or more terms or phrases are synonymous e.g. because of an explicit statement that the terms or phrases are synonymous instances of one such term phrase does not mean instances of another such term phrase must have a different meaning. For example where a statement renders the meaning of including to be synonymous with including but not limited to the mere usage of the phrase including but not limited to does not mean that the term including means something other than including but not limited to .

The term facilitating and like terms may include any action or set of actions which help to bring about a result. Throughout this disclosure examples of facilitation may be given. Such examples should be interpreted as non limiting examples only.

An order query should be understood to include information that when interpreted by a computer module identifies an order for which a trade related action is desired. Such information may be interpreted by the computer module for use in querying stored information such as a database of stored order information.

A firm order should be understood to include an order for a financial instrument for which a system will execute a trade with a matching order without additional intervening authorization from an originator of the firm order.

A financial instrument should be understood to include an instrument that evinces ownership of dept or equity and or any derivative thereof including equities stocks fixed income instruments bonds debentures certificates of interest or deposit warrants options futures forwards swaps or generally any security.

Although some embodiments are described with reference to Order Management Systems which are understood in the art it should be understood that other embodiments may include an order information system. An order information system should be understood any system through which information about orders to purchase and or sell financial instruments is stored including for example order management systems.

Two things should be understood to match if they share one or more properties. The exact properties shared may be different among various embodiments. Some example properties may include a type of financial instrument e.g. industry capitalization risk etc. a security identifier e.g. stock symbol etc. an amount of shares a price etc.

A representation of a thing includes any indication from which a part of an underlying thing may be derived.

Enabling should be understood to include allowing an action to occur. An action may be enabled by for example providing activating a mechanism e.g. a button or other control through which the action may be performed e.g. by clicking a button or otherwise activating another control .

Binding acceptance of an order should be understood to include an acceptance of a trade fulfilling at least part of the order that does not allow for further intervention in the execution of the trade and without the ability to revoke the acceptance e.g. without the ability to revoke the acceptance in any way without the ability to revoke the acceptance without a penalty .

An acceptance of an order should be understood to include an agreement to participate in a trade fulfilling at least part of the order.

Suppressing evidence should be understood to include attempting to prevent others from discovering evidence. Suppressing evidence of a situation or action may include not disseminating information about the situation or action disseminating false or misleading information about the situation or action disseminating false or mislead information at other times to obscure the dissemination of information about the situation or action and or any other desired actions.

Facilitating execution of a trade should be understood to include performing any actions that help to bring about the execution of a trade. The actions may include for example actually executing the trade transmitting a request for the execution of the trade transmitting any information that helps to bring about the trade and or any other actions.

A marketplace should be understood to include a platform through which at least the following actions are performed order execution is facilitated indications of orders are accepted and matches for the orders are sought.

Applying a filter to a set of things should be understood to include generating a subset of the set of things in which each thing in the subset has one or more desired properties.

A trade should be understood to fulfill part of an order for one or more things if the trade includes transfers of ownership of at least a portion of the one of more thing in accordance with the order. Fulfilling may include bringing a trade into effect.

A participant system should be understood to include any system that allows an order management system to interface with a marketplace.

The term determining and grammatical variants thereof e.g. to determine a price determining a value determine an object which meets a certain criterion is used in an extremely broad sense. The term determining encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore determining can include calculating computing processing deriving investigating looking up e.g. looking up in a table a database or another data structure ascertaining and the like. Also determining can include receiving e.g. receiving information accessing e.g. accessing data in a memory and the like. Also determining can include resolving selecting choosing establishing and the like.

The term determining does not imply certainty or absolute precision and therefore determining can include estimating extrapolating predicting guessing and the like.

The term determining does not imply that mathematical processing must be performed and does not imply that numerical methods must be used and does not imply that an algorithm or process is used.

The term determining does not imply that any particular device must be used. For example a computer need not necessarily perform the determining.

Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature e.g. a limitation such as at least one widget covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article the to refer to the limitation e.g. the widget this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature e.g. the widget can cover both one widget and more than one widget .

When an ordinal number such as first second third and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example a first widget may be so named merely to distinguish it from e.g. a second widget . Thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget 1 does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location 2 does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and 3 does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality. In addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.

When a single device article or other product is described herein more than one device article whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single device article that is described. Accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device article whether or not they cooperate .

Similarly where more than one device article or other product is described herein whether or not they cooperate a single device article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example a plurality of computer based devices may be substituted with a single computer based device. Accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device article.

The functionality and or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality features. Thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such functionality features.

Neither the Title set forth at the beginning of the first page of the present application nor the Abstract set forth at the end of the present application is to be taken as limiting in any way as the scope of the disclosed invention s . An Abstract has been included in this application merely because an Abstract of not more than 150 words is required under 37 C.F.R. 1.72 b .

The title of the present application and headings of sections provided in the present application are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.

Numerous embodiments are described in the present application and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not and are not intended to be limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention s are widely applicable to numerous embodiments as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention s may be practiced with various modifications and alterations such as structural logical software and electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention s may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and or drawings it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described unless expressly specified otherwise.

No embodiment of method steps or product elements described in the present application constitutes the invention claimed herein or is essential to the invention claimed herein or is coextensive with the invention claimed herein except where it is either expressly stated to be so in this specification or expressly recited in a claim.

The preambles of the claims that follow recite purposes benefits and possible uses of the claimed invention only and do not limit the claimed invention.

The present disclosure is not a literal description of all embodiments of the invention s . Also the present disclosure is not a listing of features of the invention s which must be present in all embodiments.

Devices that are described as in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for long period of time e.g. weeks at a time . In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.

A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components features are required. On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present invention s . Unless otherwise specified explicitly no component feature is essential or required.

Although process steps algorithms or the like may be described or claimed in a particular sequential order such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described or claimed does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order possible. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention s and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.

Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps that does not imply that all or any of the steps are preferred essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly no step is essential or required.

Although a process may be described singly or without reference to other products or methods in an embodiment the process may interact with other products or methods. For example such interaction may include linking one business model to another business model. Such interaction may be provided to enhance the flexibility or desirability of the process.

Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components aspects qualities characteristics and or features that does not indicate that any or all of the plurality are preferred essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise an enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the enumerated list a computer a laptop a PDA does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are equivalent to each other or readily substituted for each other.

All embodiments are illustrative and do not imply that the invention or any embodiments were made or performed as the case may be.

It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various processes described herein may be implemented by e.g. appropriately programmed general purpose computers special purpose computers and computing devices. One or more such computers or computing devices may be referred to as a computer system. illustrates an example computer system. The computer system comprises a plurality of server computers and client computers . Typically a processor e.g. one or more microprocessors one or more microcontrollers one or more digital signal processors will receive instructions e.g. from a memory or like device and execute those instructions thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions. Instructions may be embodied in e.g. one or more computer programs one or more scripts.

A processor means one or more microprocessors central processing units CPUs computing devices microcontrollers digital signal processors or like devices or any combination thereof regardless of the architecture e.g. chip level multiprocessing multi core RISC CISC Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages pipelining configuration simultaneous multithreading .

Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of an apparatus for performing the process. The apparatus that performs the process can include e.g. a processor and those input devices and output devices that are appropriate to perform the process.

Further programs that implement such methods as well as other types of data may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media e.g. computer readable media in a number of manners. In some embodiments hard wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of or in combination with some or all of the software instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus various combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.

The term computer readable medium refers to any medium a plurality of the same or a combination of different media which participate in providing data e.g. instructions data structures which may be read by a computer a processor or a like device. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory DRAM which typically constitutes the main memory. Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves light waves and electromagnetic emissions such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM a FLASH EEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave as described hereinafter or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data e.g. sequences of instructions to a processor. For example data may be i delivered from RAM to a processor ii carried over a wireless transmission medium iii formatted and or transmitted according to numerous formats standards or protocols such as Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 SAP ATP Bluetooth and TCP IP TDMA CDMA and 3G and or iv encrypted to ensure privacy or prevent fraud in any of a variety of ways well known in the art.

Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of a computer readable medium storing a program for performing the process. The computer readable medium can store in any appropriate format those program elements which are appropriate to perform the method.

Just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required embodiments of an apparatus include a computer computing device operable to perform some but not necessarily all of the described process.

Likewise just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required embodiments of a computer readable medium storing a program or data structure include a computer readable medium storing a program that when executed can cause a processor to perform some but not necessarily all of the described process.

A computer system may also include one or more input output devices . Such input output devices may include monitors keyboards mice and r any other desired devices.

Some computer systems may include transmission medium which may be referred to as a communication network that couples various internal components of the computer system. Such a communication network may also be referred to in some implementations as a computer bus. Some computer systems may include a specialized input output device configured to connect to an external communication network. Such a device may be referred to as a network interface. The external communication network may include a LAN and or the Internet . In some implementations an edge routing device may operate between a LAN and another network like the Internet . Such a device may include a firewall and or any other desired security mechanism.

Where databases are described it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that i alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed and ii other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information. Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by e.g. tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those described herein. Further despite any depiction of the databases as tables other formats including relational databases object based models and or distributed databases could be used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes such as the described herein. In addition the databases may in a known manner be stored locally or remotely from a device which accesses data in such a database.

Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment including a computer that is in communication e.g. via a communications network with one or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly via any wired or wireless medium e.g. the Internet LAN WAN or Ethernet Token Ring a telephone line a cable line a radio channel an optical communications line commercial on line service providers bulletin board systems a satellite communications link a combination of any of the above . Each of the devices may themselves comprise computers or other computing devices such as those based on the Intel Pentium Core or Centrino processor that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number and type of devices may be in communication with the computer.

In an embodiment a server computer or centralized authority may not be necessary or desirable. For example the present invention may in an embodiment be practiced on one or more devices without a central authority. In such an embodiment any functions described herein as performed by the server computer or data described as stored on the server computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more such devices.

Where a process is described in an embodiment the process may operate without any user intervention. In another embodiment the process includes some human intervention e.g. a step is performed by or with the assistance of a human .

The present disclosure provides to one of ordinary skill in the art an enabling description of several embodiments and or inventions. Some of these embodiments and or inventions may not be claimed in the present application but may nevertheless be claimed in one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present application.

Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter that has been disclosed and enabled but not claimed in the present application.

In a claim a limitation of the claim which includes the phrase means for or the phrase step for means that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 applies to that limitation.

In a claim a limitation of the claim which does not include the phrase means for or the phrase step for means that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 does not apply to that limitation regardless of whether that limitation recites a function without recitation of structure material or acts for performing that function. For example in a claim the mere use of the phrase step of or the phrase steps of in referring to one or more steps of the claim or of another claim does not mean that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 applies to that step s .

With respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 the corresponding structure material or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof may perform additional functions as well as the specified function.

Computers processors computing devices and like products are structures that can perform a wide variety of functions. Such products can be operable to perform a specified function by executing one or more programs such as a program stored in a memory device of that product or in a memory device which that product accesses. Unless expressly specified otherwise such a program need not be based on any particular algorithm such as any particular algorithm that might be disclosed in the present application. It is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art that a specified function may be implemented via different algorithms and any of a number of different algorithms would be a mere design choice for carrying out the specified function.

Therefore with respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 structure corresponding to a specified function includes any product programmed to perform the specified function. Such structure includes programmed products which perform the function regardless of whether such product is programmed with i a disclosed algorithm for performing the function ii an algorithm that is similar to a disclosed algorithm or iii a different algorithm for performing the function.

Where there is recited a means for performing a function hat is a method one structure for performing this method includes a computing device e.g. a general purpose computer that is programmed and or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that function.

Also includes a computing device e.g. a general purpose computer that is programmed and or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that function via other algorithms as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Numerous references to a particular embodiment does not indicate a disclaimer or disavowal of additional different embodiments and similarly references to the description of embodiments which all include a particular feature does not indicate a disclaimer or disavowal of embodiments which do not include that particular feature. A clear disclaimer or disavowal in the present application shall be prefaced by the phrase does not include or by the phrase cannot perform .

Any patent patent application or other document referred to herein is incorporated by reference into this patent application as part of the present disclosure but only for purposes of written description in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 1 and enablement in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 1 and should in no way be used to limit define or otherwise construe any term of the present application where the present application without such incorporation by reference would not have failed to provide an ascertainable meaning but rather would have allowed an ascertainable meaning for such term to be provided. Thus the person of ordinary skill in the art need not have been in any way limited by any embodiments provided in the reference

Any incorporation by reference does not in and of itself imply any endorsement of ratification of or acquiescence in any statements opinions arguments or characterizations contained in any incorporated patent patent application or other document unless explicitly specified otherwise in this patent application.

In interpreting the present application which includes the claims one of ordinary skill in the art shall refer to the prosecution history of the present application but not to the prosecution history of any other patent or patent application regardless of whether there are other patent applications that are considered related to the present application and regardless of whether there are other patent applications that share a claim of priority with the present application.

Information about orders for good or service may be tracked by an order management system OMS . An order management system may include data regarding desired contemplated open completed considered ongoing and or other order. One typical order management system used in securities trading includes the Fidessa Order Management System. Although this order management system and embodiments below focus largely on the trading of securities e.g. stocks bonds futures options derivatives etc. it should be recognized that other embodiments may be used in connection with the trading of any goods and or services whether tangible e.g. food oil collectibles etc. or intangible intellectual property rights contract performance etc. .

Information that is stored by an OMS may identify a specific security that is desired e.g. by a user of the OMS by a client of the user of the OMS etc. a type or class of security that is desired an amount or range of amounts of a security that is desired a desired price price range and or pricing method to be used to buy the security a limit on a desired price associated with a limit order for the security a security to be sold a price price range and or pricing method to be used to sell a security a security desired or available to be sold e.g. long and or short sale an amount of a security to be sold contingent buying and or selling information e.g. information identifying a purchase to be made if some contingent event occurs information setting amounts based on a contingent price etc. and or any other information.

Pricing policies may include any desired pricing policy supported by a trading system. In some embodiments such a pricing policy may include for example midpoint pricing in which prices are based on a midpoint between a national best offer and national best bid limit pricing in which a maximum or minimum price level cannot be passed midpoint pricing subject to such a limit volume weighted average pricing in which the weighted average price over a trading period is the bases of the price. Any other methods or combinations of pricing policies may be used.

Market liquidity a measure a securities ability to be bought and or sold readily through a market is recognized as a factor that may affect prices at which securities are traded. For example one may have a more difficult time selling an illiquid security because potential buyers may fear they will be unable to resell the security after purchase. Such fear may artificially lower the price of the sale of the security from the true market value of the security to help alleviate the fears of such potential buyers. Accordingly a more liquid market may facilitate trading of securities at their fair market values or closer to their fair market values than they would be traded at in a less liquid market.

In some markets information identifying orders e.g. bids offers etc. that is stored by order management systems or otherwise stored internally by a trading organization or trader have not traditionally been thought of as liquidity available to the market. Rather such orders typically add to the liquidity of those markets only when they are made public to the market so other traders in the market may act against those orders. Such secret orders may be referred to as dark pools or dark books of liquidity because they remain unseen by such markets.

It is recognized that enabling trading to take place using such orders may improve the liquidity of a market and thereby allow more trades to occur through a market and or allow trades to occur at a price closer to or at a fair market value.

It is recognized that one problem that may be associated with using such orders in a market includes a potential that information associated with the existence of otherwise secret orders may be used to influence a market and or to diminish an advantage attributable to the originator of the information e.g. some insight knowledge trading algorithm etc. . In typical markets when bids and offers match a negotiation may take place between a buyer and a seller before any transaction is finalized. Such negotiations typically include revealing the existence of a matching party information about a matching order associated with the matching party and or the identity of the matching party to both parties involved in the negotiation. By revealing this information the potential to game the market e.g. artificially affect a market using knowledge of the existence of orders of other people is increased and the possibly secret knowledge embodied by the orders may be made public. For example a trader may end a negotiation by refusing an order in a negotiation. The trader may subsequently use the knowledge that the matching party is interested in a transaction related to the security to increase or decrease the price of the security by entering one or more other orders at higher or lower prices and or use the knowledge embodied by the order to adjust otherwise adjust a trading strategy.

It is recognized that as the size of orders increases the chances that a trader associated with such orders is trying to game the market may decrease. Accordingly it is recognized that trading large blocks of liquidity may decrease the probability that gaming is occurring. It is also recognized that if a trader agrees to have an order executed without a negotiation without receiving notification before the execution and or otherwise automatically the chance that the trader is trying to game the market is also decrease. Furthermore it is recognized that if anonymity of trading partners is maintained for part or all of a trading exchange the chances of gaming the market are also reduced. Accordingly participants in securities markets such as buy and or sell side participants may be more willing to participate in markets with one or more such characteristics. Further such participants may be more willing to allow orders present in OMS to add liquidity to such markets. Markets with such characteristics may for example allow large blocks of securities to be moved relatively quietly compared to traditional trading mechanisms.

It is recognized that in some markets such as typical securities markets participants exist in an asymmetrical relationship. For example participants known as sell side firms in securities markets generally act as retail brokers and researchers for investors. Participants known as buy side firms in securities markets generally include investment institutions that tend to buy and or sell large amounts of securities for money management purposes and keep information about their trading intentions secret. Accordingly the desires of these participants may not be identical. Some embodiments may be configured to treat differently participants with different characteristics in an attempt to balance desires of the different participants.

Some embodiments of a trading system may allow access to what might be traditionally untapped pools of liquidity e.g. orders in OMS systems . Such systems may provide asymmetric access rules to such information to accommodate desires and or preferences of market participants. Such systems may include anonymity policies order size restrictions incentives filtering policies and or automatic execution of types of orders to encourage participation.

Some embodiments may read information from an OMS or other source of orders associated with a buy side market participant. Information regarding such orders may be used to match information from other market participants with one or more element of anonymity automatic order execution and or order size policy implementations. In some embodiments the information may be narrowcast to potential counter parties for matching with orders associated with the OMS of those parties. Accordingly market participants such as sell side participants and buy side participants can submit orders both firm orders and OMS orders that add liquidity to a market with a degree of privacy and or a security that the market is not being gamed by other participants. A participant may include a person and or machine that interfaces in some way with a marketplace to engage in trading. A participant may include an OMS a computer that interfaces with an OMS and or any other type of computer or trading related apparatus.

In some embodiments firm orders i.e. orders for which participants agree to automatic order execution with matching orders may be viewed anonymously by those unlikely to abuse the information and or by nobody at all. In some implementations such participants may include buy side participants who may view information about firm orders if a matching order exists in an OMS associated with a respective buy side participant. In some implementations such participants may include participants for which matching firm orders exist e.g. have been submitted to a trading system . By limiting the viewing of such information trading of high quality block liquidity using pools of liquidity currently not available may be encouraged.

In some embodiments control over one or more aspects of disclosing information about orders in an OMS may reside with buy side originators of the orders. In some embodiments sell side participants or other buy side participants that enter a firm order matching an order in a buy side participant s OMS may only be notified of the existence of such a matching order if the buy side participant with the order in its OMS agrees to such notification and or agrees to an execution of a trade. In some embodiments the sell side participants or other buy side participants may not be notified of the identity of the buy side participant at all but rather only be notified that some matching order was found and or executed.

The central system or a place at which orders are executed may be called a marketplace . In some embodiments various actions such as firm order querying firm order matching providing indications of firm orders firm order matches receipt of indications that firm order queries firm order matches exist and or any other desired actions may occur for example upstream from such a marketplace.

As illustrated the trading system may include a central system . The central system may include one or more computer systems each configured to perform one or more processes. Such computer systems may receive transmit and or process information as desired. In some implementations the central system may be configured to perform actions including receiving information relating to orders e.g. firm orders matching firm orders executing trades facilitating the execution of trades clearing orders facilitating the clearing of orders communicating with remote systems settling orders reporting trades querying remote systems to determine if matching order exist querying processes or databases to determine if matching orders exist and or any other desired actions.

In some embodiments the central system may be distributed among a plurality of regional hubs. Such distribution may allow a trading system to span a very large geographic area through which a very large number of trades may be routed. Such regional hubs may include duplication and or distribution of functionality.

In some embodiments the central system may be responsible for facilitating one or more functions typically referred to as back office functions. For example the central system may facilitate clearing of trades settling of trades reporting of trades credit checking of participants other functions required for compliance with rules and regulations and or any other desired functions.

In some embodiments the central system may include a firm order matching system. Such a system may be configured to determine if firm orders match other firm orders and or perform other functions related to such firm order matching. In some embodiments the central system may include an order router matching module. Such a module may be configured to route order queries to one or more participants and or perform any desired actions associated with OMS orders. In some embodiments the central system may include a regulation NMS system. Such a system may interface with one or more other securities markets to find better pricing options for an order. Such action may be required in some embodiments because of securities regulations.

In some embodiments the central system may be coupled to one or more remote systems by a communication network . The communication network may include the Internet one or more local area networks and or any other desired communication medium. The communication network may allow the central system to transmit and or receive information to and or from remote systems such as computer systems associated with market participants. In some embodiments communication between systems modules processes and or programs may include the use of Financial Information eXchange messaging. Such messaging may be encrypted or not as desired. In some embodiments one or more firewalls or other security device may be included in the communication network .

In some embodiments system may include one or more sell side computer systems each indicated by . The sell side systems may include one or more trading computers configured to accept information regarding security offers e.g. firm orders to buy and or sell securities . The sell side systems may be configured to receive send and or processes information. In some embodiments the sell side systems may be configured to transmit one or more indications of such orders to the central system over the communication network . In some distributed embodiments the sell side systems may be configure to transfer information to one or more other sell side systems and or buy side systems . In some embodiments the sell side systems may be configured to receive information identifying a completed order execution e.g. from the central system and may provide an indication of such an indication to a user e.g. through a trading interface . In some embodiments the sell side systems may be configured to interact with the central system or an otherwise distributed system. In some embodiments a separate computer system may act as an interface between the central system or otherwise distributed system and the rest of the sell side system . Although the sell side systems are shown as a single system it should be recognized that any number of computers may be used to perform any desired functions of a sell side system.

Some embodiments may include one or more buy side systems each indicated at . In some embodiments all or part of the buy side systems may be located with a buy side market participant. In some embodiments all or part of the buy side systems may be distributed or located at a central location such as with central system .

In some embodiments the buy side systems may include one or more trader systems each indicated at block . The trader systems may provide an interface to one or more traders through which information may be obtained or provided. Traders for example may enter order information and or receive indications associated with orders through a trader systems .

In some embodiments the buy side systems may include one or more OMS systems . The OMS systems may perform one or more functions typically performed by an OMS. Such functions may include storing order information providing order information to trader computers and or any other desired functions. As mentioned above one example OMS system includes the Fidessa OMS system.

In some embodiments the buy side systems may include one or more participant systems . In some embodiments the participant systems may act as an interface between the central system or an otherwise distributed system and the rest of the buy side system . In some embodiments the participant system may perform function related to trading such as storing order information receiving firm order queries executing orders facilitating execution of orders clearing orders facilitating clearing of orders transmitting order information determining if matching orders exist providing indication regarding order queries searching existing orders determining if an order is a firm order or a OMS order and or any other desired functions. Participant systems may enhance the functionality of traditional OMS systems by allowing otherwise unavailable pools of liquidity to become available to a market. In various embodiments participant systems may query an OMS for updated information pull information from the OMS may receive updates from the OMS as information in the OMS changes information may be pushed from the OMS and or synchronize with an OMS in any desired way.

In some embodiments participant systems may query e.g. periodically randomly etc. OMS systems to generate a copy of an OMS database. In some embodiments the OMS systems may send information to the participant systems in response to such queries and or without any querying taking place. Such information may include indications of orders in the OMS database e.g. updates of prior orders changes to orders deletions of orders new orders complete database copies etc. In some embodiments a participant system may directly access the OMS database e.g. without the need to make a copy of the OMS system such as by querying the database. In still other embodiments the OMs system and participant system may be a single system and such distinctions may not be relevant.

In some embodiments buy side order information may be maintained in confidence on buy side systems which may be located on respective buy side participants premises. By so maintaining the information buy side participants may feel more secure about the use of such information for trading and be less worried about potential information leakage.

In some embodiments one or more software modules may act as part of an OMS system to provide some or all buy side functionality. Such modules may exist in addition to and or as an alternative to the participant system . For example the module may include an update to an OMS software or a companion program to an OMS software program.

Although shows OMS systems participant systems and trading systems as separate systems it should be understood that any configuration of systems may be used. For example a single system may operate as all or part of any other systems e.g. a single system may act as an OMS system and a participant system etc. Furthermore various systems may share information and or distribute the performance of functions. For example an OMS system may maintain an order database that may be read by one or more or a trading system a participant system and or any other desired system.

In some embodiments one or more of the buy side or sell side systems may include mobile devices. Such mobile devices may include laptop computers PDAs cellular telephones and or any other desired mobile device.

In some embodiments one or more software modules may act as companions and or replacements to trading interface software and or OMS software. Such companion or replacement software may include additional and or different options from traditional interface and or OMS software.

Although shows buy side systems and sell side systems as connected to separate parts of communication network it should be understood that such systems may be connected to a same network such as the Internet or any other communication network.

In some embodiments one or more participants may use a virtual OMS rather than a traditional OMS. It should be understood that reference to an OMS includes reference to such a virtual OMS. A virtual OMS may include a system that acts as a dedicated OMS for a plurality of participants but in reality is a shared system. For example in some implementations a virtual OMs may include a system that is remote from a participant and accessed over the Internet. The system may include a separate database for each such participant for tracking typical OMS information. It should be understood that some systems may include a single database with a participant identifier and or any other method of storing information that may be used in providing virtual OMS services to participants. The use of a virtual OMS may provide a participant with OMS services without the need to maintain and or purchase a dedicated OMS system.

As indicated at block process may include receiving an indication of an order. In some implementations the order may be a firm order. In some embodiments such an indication may be considered a binding indication on the part of the firm order submitter. For example central system may receive an indication of such an order from a buy side system e.g. and or a sell side system e.g. . Such orders may be entered for example by a trader using a trading interface at a buy or sell side firm. The indication of the firm order may identify that an originator of the order is committed to a transaction e.g. a bid offer etc. . In some embodiments an indication of an order may indicate an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for a firm order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier and or any other information. The order may define a side of a trade for a financial instrument. A side of a trade for a financial instrument may include one of a desire to buy a financial instrument and a desire to sell a financial instrument.

As indicated at block process may include determining if any matching firm orders are available. A matching order may include an order that includes complementary terms to the firm order. Such terms may include a security an amount a price a time frame and or any other desired information. For example the firm order may indicate that 10 000 shares of eSpeed stock should be purchased at an average price of 100.00 per share. A prior firm order may have been received that indicates 10 000 shares of eSpeed stock should be sold at an average price of 100.00 per share. The prior eSpeed order may be determined to match the later eSpeed order in such a situation. In some embodiments orders within a price range below a maximum price above a minimum price and or matching in any other desired ways may also be determined to be matching. In some embodiments orders for a larger number of smaller number of shares may be determined to be matching. In some embodiments an indication of a firm order may identify a minimum and or maximum order size percentages for which other firm orders may be determined to be matching.

In some embodiments multiple orders may be determined to be matching according to some priority mechanism so that a total number of shares of all matching orders sums to at least as much as a number indicated by the firm order indication. In some embodiments in which multiple orders are determined to be matching a priority may be assigned to some of the orders based one or more characteristics of the orders an originator of the orders and or any other characteristic.

In some embodiments a matching firm order may have been received from a buy or sell side system. Such a matching order may have been stored on a machine readable medium e.g. a disk drive of the central system . Determining if a matching firm order has previously been received may include searching a database or other listing of previously received firm orders. Such a database may be keyed to allow quick lookup such as by security identifier e.g. stock symbol .

Some embodiments may include maintaining a listing of firm orders. Such a listing may include a database. Maintaining the listing may include adding newly received firm orders to the listing deleting fulfilled firm orders from the listing deleting expired firm orders from the listing and or any other desired actions.

As indicated at block if one or more matching firm order is determined to exist the execution of some or all of those matching firm orders may be facilitated to fulfill the received firm order. Each such matching orders may fully or partially fulfill the received firm order. Facilitating the execution may include performing an exchange of money for a security clearing such an exchange transmitting information to a remote execution and or clearing service notifying participants and or any other desired action. A trade may be facilitated at a price and or with a quantity that may be identified from a query.

In some embodiments in which multiple matching orders exist the matching orders may be matched to the received firm order based on any desired prioritizing mechanism. Such prioritizing mechanism may include prioritizing based on price of security first come first serve priority given to older and or most active originators of orders large orders may be matched first priority given to closest match in price and or size a round robin system and or any other desired prioritizing method. In some embodiments multiple orders may be combined together to fully fulfill as many existing offers as possible. In some embodiments part of each matching order may be fulfilled. The part may correspond to some characteristic of the order or order originator such as order size loyalty of originator activeness of originator actual price compared to desired price etc.

In some embodiments process may end at block if a matching firm order is found. In some embodiments if one or more matching firm orders exist but do not completely fulfill the received firm order execution of the matching firm order may be facilitated and a remaining balance of the firm order may be treated as if no matching firm order had been found e.g. may continue as described below with a firm order that includes only the left over order amount .

In some embodiments as indicated at block process may include querying one or more participants to find a matching order. In some embodiments querying the participants may include transmitting one or more requests from a central system e.g. to a buy side system e.g. . In other embodiments querying the participants may include transmitting requests from a computer of a distributed system to another computer of the distributed system such as from one buy side participant to another or one sell side participant to a buy side participant etc. In some embodiments such querying may continue from one participant to another participant in a tree like fashion in which one or more participants queries one or more further participants which may themselves continue querying further participants and so on. Such action may be taken if no matching firm order was found or an incomplete set of matching firm orders was previously found as described above. In still other embodiments querying may include transmitting requests to other processes threads memory locations portion of a computer program etc. executing by a single system such as central system or multiple systems such as a distributed system.

Systems associated with market participants e.g. buy side system participant systems may be configured to accept requests and determine if matching OMS orders exist. In some situations which are discussed in more detail below some such systems may respond to a query indicating that a match exists. In some implementations such a response may include an indication that the trade has already been executed and or cleared e.g. by a remote system to which a request was transmitted some other system etc. .

In some embodiments the act of querying and or some or all response that may be received may be concealed and or otherwise suppressed from an originator of the firm order and or any other individual. For example if a negative response is received such a response may not be revealed to the originator of the firm order. In some embodiments as discussed below only a positive response may be revealed. In some embodiments negative response may be eliminated or otherwise suppressed. By limiting responses actions may be kept secret from originators of the order and the participants may be granted an additional level of anonymity thereby encouraging them to participate in the trading system because the opportunity and or chances to game the market may be reduced.

As indicated at block process may include receiving additional firm orders from various other firm order sources such as buy side and or sell side participants. Such receipt of new firm orders may occur substantially simultaneously as the querying of participants. Such new firm orders may be compared with the received firm order from block to determine if they are matching similar to the description above with respect to block .

As indicated at block process may include determining if a matching order is found. Finding a matching order may include receiving a new firm order from another source and or receiving a response from a participant that a matching order exists.

If no matching order is determined to exist process may loop back to block . In various embodiments the participants may be queried periodically. The period may be any length such as 30 seconds 30 minutes a random length a length based on some characteristic of a trader and or order etc. In various embodiments participants may be queried until either a match is found a matching firm order is received a time period associated with the firm order expires the firm order is revoked and or any other desired length of time.

If one or more matching orders is determined to exist process may include facilitating execution of a trade fulfilling the firm order and the one or more matching orders as indicated at block . In some embodiments facilitating may include executing a trade clearing a trade transmitting indications that execution or clearing of a trade should be performed by a remote system and or any other desired actions. In some embodiments execution of the trade may occur at a remote server such as one or more servers at which a firm order match is found e.g. a buy side system etc. and or a central system such as central system .

In some embodiments a matching order may not fulfill a whole firm order. In such situations process may continue to search for matching orders e.g. by querying remote servers and awaiting new firm orders in a loop to block .

In some embodiments multiple matching orders may be found within a relatively short period of time. For example multiple firm orders may be received and or multiple OMS orders may be found at participants within a relatively short period of time. Such a time period may be any amount of time desired such as 1 second 1 minute etc.

In various embodiments order execution with such matching orders found within such a short period of time may be based on some desired set of priorities. In such embodiments matching orders found with in the short period of time may be treated as if they were found simultaneously and executed based on some other priority mechanism. For example firm orders may be executed first or orders found through querying participants may be executed first first entered orders may be executed first larger orders may be executed first smaller orders may be executed first older orders may be executed first newer orders may be executed first best customers may have their orders executed first highest ranked customers may have their orders executed first customers willing to be charged a fee may have their orders executed first and or any other method may be used to determine execution order. In other embodiments order execution may be based strictly on the order in which the matching order is found.

Process may end at block after facilitation of the execution of the orders is complete. In some embodiments one or more participants such as originators of the orders may be notified of execution. In some embodiments the order of acts may not be the same is indicated in process . In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner.

As indicated at block process may include receiving an indication of an order. Such an indication may be received for example from a trader entering information about desired trades through a trading interface. The indication may include an identification of a price an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for an order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier and or any other information.

As indicated at block process may include determining if the order is a firm order. A firm order as described above may indicate that an order should be executed substantially automatically. A OMS order may indicate that the information about the order is to remain secret from other market participants and or should not be automatically executed against. Some embodiments may not include a separate act of determining a type of order. For example in some embodiments different processes threads and or systems may receive the different types of orders so that the act of receiving the order itself identifies the type of order. For example a trader may use one interface to submit an OMS order e.g. to an OMS system to a participant system etc. and use a different interface to submit a firm order e.g. to a central system etc. . In some embodiments a single program may be used to submit the different order types and the program may make the determination e.g. based on different buttons pressed based on different checkboxes selected etc. .

As indicated at block if the order is a firm order process may include providing the indication of the order for firm order execution. Such providing may include transmitting information about the order to the central system or a distributed system. Such an order may be received by such system which may attempt to execute the order substantially automatically e.g. using a process similar to process . In some embodiments such providing may include providing the information to a processing thread or program executed by one or more computing devices. Process may end at block if the order is a firm order. In other embodiments process may continue to provide updated information about the execution of the firm order such as through an interface of a trading computer.

As indicated at block if the order is not a firm order process may include an act of storing information about the order. Storing the information may include storing the information on a machine readable medium such as in RAM on a hard disk etc. The medium may be part of associated with one or more of an OMS system and or a participant system. The information may be stored in one or more database tables configured to store information about orders. Such a database table may be arranged for easy searching of orders to determining if an incoming order request matches any of the ordered stored in the database. For example in some embodiments the database may be keyed by a name of a security.

Some embodiments may include maintaining stored information. Such information may be maintained similar to the maintenance of order information in a typical OMS system. In some embodiments maintenance may include the actions of an OMS and or a participant system. Maintenance may include updating orders executed in connection with matching firm order queries. For example order information may be removed updated when an order is fully or partially fulfilled an order expires an order is explicitly removed or updated by a trader and or for any other desired reason.

As indicated at block process may include receive incoming firm order queries. An incoming firm order query may indicate an identification of a price an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for an order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier and or any other information. In some embodiments such firm order queries may be received from one or more computer systems performing a process similar to that shown in process . In some embodiments the firm order queries may include orders that would fulfill part or all of the OMS order. Such queries may be received at a participant system an OMS system configured to perform some or all of the action of process and or any other desired location.

As indicated at block process may include determining that a firm order query matches the order. For example a result from a database query that includes terms identified by the firm order query e.g. security identifier price quantity etc. may return a positive result.

As indicated at block process may include attempting to facilitate execution of a trade with the matching firm order query. Facilitating execution of a trade may include for example displaying an indication of the firm order to a trader through one or more trading interfaces as discussed in more detail below raising an alarm or other audible alert for such a trader and or any other desired action. In some such embodiments the trader may be asked to accept the matching order or reject the matching order. If the trader in some embodiments acceptance of the order the system may execute a trade forward information for the trade to be executed and or cleared by another system and or perform any other desired action to further facilitate execution of the trade.

In some embodiments by keeping the OMS orders secret from other trading participants a trading system performing process may encourage traders to allow pools of liquidity that would typically remain inaccessible such as orders in OMS systems to be used to match against firm orders. This encouragement may be particularly important to buy side participants who may typically be protective of their order information. Such use of OMS orders may increase liquidity in a market using such a process.

Process may end at block after facilitating execution of the trade. In some embodiments one or more participants such as originators of the orders may be notified of execution. In some embodiments stored information regarding the orders may be updated to reflect the order execution. In some embodiments in which only part of the OMS order is fulfilled by the matching firm order process may include receiving additional firm order queries and facilitating execution of those orders.

In some embodiments the order of acts in process may not be the same is indicated in . In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner. For example process may be performed by the participant systems by an OMS system configured to perform one or more parts of process and or by any other system. In some embodiments process may be performed only in connection with a buy side participant.

As indicated at block process may include identifying one or more participants. Participants may include one or more remote servers one or more computer processes threads or programs. For example in some embodiments participants may include buy side systems. In other embodiments participants may include sell side systems and or other systems. Identifying participants may include querying potential participants in a list of participants e.g. pinging IP addresses making function calls etc. . In some embodiments identifying participants may include placing one or more items in a predefined memory location querying a predefined memory location for information about participants accessing a database or other listing of participants receiving an indication that a participant exists e.g. from the participant from an administrator etc. and or any other actions desired. In some embodiments the identified participants may include child participants of a tree like participant structure.

As indicated at block process may include receiving an indication of a firm order. Such a firm order may be substantially similar to the firm order received at block in process .

As indicated at block process may include transmitting requests to the identified servers. Such requests may be substantially similar to those discussed above with respect to block in process . In some embodiments as discussed above with respect to process the received firm orders may be matched against other locally stored firm orders instead of or in addition to querying of participants as discussed with respect to process .

In some embodiments participants may be arranged in a distributed fashion. For example in one embodiment participants may be arranged in a tree like fashion. In such an embodiment a first participant may query one or more other participants. The other participants may determine if matches exist locally. If matches exist the participants may return a positive indication e.g. to the originating participant the originator of the firm order a marketplace etc. . If no match is found locally the further participants may query additional participants. The order of querying may be established based on any desired priority mechanism e.g. largest customers are queried first premium customers queried first highest ranked customers queried first etc. . In some embodiments a participant may query additional participants regardless of whether a match is found locally.

As indicated at block process may include determining if a response was received from a queried participant. In some embodiments determining if a response was received may include querying a port or socket through which communication may be received from a communication network. In other embodiments determining if a response is received may include querying a register memory location process thread program function and or any other action.

In some embodiments if no responses is received process may loop back to block to send one or more additional requests. Any number of requests may be sent any number of times. Any period of time may pass between transmission of requests random periodic etc. . Process may continue to loop until a response is received a matching firm order is found otherwise a time period expires and or any other event occurs.

In some embodiments the participants queried at each loop may be the same or different. For example in some embodiments an initial group of participants may be queried first e.g. a premium group of participants a group of good customers a group of high volume customers etc and then after some period of time a second group of participants may be queried. Any number of such subgroups may be queried in such order.

As indicated at block process may include facilitating execution of a trade fulfilling a matching order in the response. Facilitating may include executing a trade clearing a trade forwarding information requests and or any other desired action. In other embodiments a response may indicate that a trade has been or will be executed and or cleared e.g. by a remote system .

In some embodiments a response may only be received if a match exists and or a trader desires to execute a trade. Limiting response to positive responses may encourage participation because less information is revealed from the participants. This may incentivize participants to make orders available to a market to a great extent than in traditional markets thereby increasing the liquidity of the market.

Other embodiments may include receiving negative response when no matching order exists and or a trader does not desire to execute a trade.

In some embodiments a response may be received for a trade that does not completely fulfill the firm order. In some implementations after execution of such an order process may loop back to block to query participants again. Future queries of participants may include an updated order with a requested amount decreased by the previous order. In other embodiments such facilitation of order execution may be limited to complete orders e.g. based on preferences indicated by an originator of the order based on preferences of a trading system etc. .

In some embodiments multiple responses may be received at the same time or within a relatively short time period. Orders received as such may be treated as if they were received at the same time. A priority mechanism may be used to determine which of such orders is to be executed first. For example an order associated with a high volume customer a premium customer a long term customer or a customer with any other desired characteristic may be given higher or lower priority compared with other orders. In some embodiments largest or smallest orders may be given priority. In other embodiments any desired priority mechanism may be used.

In some embodiments process may end at block . In some embodiments process may include notifying one or more traders of the execution. In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner.

Process of which begins at block illustrates an example process that may be performed by one or more participants. Process may include actions similar to process described above. In some embodiments process may be performed only by one or more buy side participants.

As indicated at block process may include receiving one or more indication of one or more orders. Such orders may include OMS orders as discussed above with respect to process . The orders may be stored accordingly as discussed with respect to block so that queries may be matched against them.

As indicated at block process may include receiving an indication of one or more firm order queries. Such firm order queries may be transmitted for example by an entity performing a process similar to process and or process as discussed above.

As indicated at block process may include filtering firm order queries. Firm order queries may be filtered based on characteristics of the order e.g. price security amount e.g. minimum amount maximum amount etc. characteristics of the originator of the order e.g. a rating of the originator a type of the originator specific originators etc. and or orders queries may be filtered according to any other desired characteristics. In some embodiments different filters may be applied to different types of securities. For example large capitalization securities may have one set of filters applied and small capitalization securities may have a different set of filters applied. In some embodiments specific securities e.g. identified by stock symbol may be filtered out or have a specific set of filters applied.

In some embodiments filtering may allow a participant to filter queries received from or sent to other participants. Filtering may be performed based on any desired characteristics. Such characteristics may include characteristics that make the order less likely to be an order associated with gaming of the market. For example in one implementations a filter may block firm orders that do not meet a minimum size requirement a minimum total dollar amount requirement and or any other desired characteristics.

In some embodiments as another example a participant may only desire to consider orders associated with originators with certain characteristics. Such characteristics may include characteristics that make an order less likely to be an order associated with gaming of the market. For example in one implementations a filter may block orders that are from a particular class of traders e.g. hedge funds etc. that are associated with a particular trader that has been identified by the participant as being involved with gaming the market that are not from a particular trusted set of participants a from a set of participants that were rated poorly by other participants are from a participant without a history of trading etc.

In some embodiments a firm order submitter may desire to filter the participants that receive queries regarding their firm orders. Such a filter may filter the participants based on characteristics of the participants behavior of the participants and so on. For example in some implementations a filter may be established based on a response pattern of participants e.g. how participants have responded to queries in the past . As an example a firm order submitter may only desire their orders to be transmitted to participants that have a history of accepting firm order queries e.g. all firm order queries firm order queries from a type of trader firm order queries for a particular financial instrument firm order queries for a class of financial instruments firm order queries for a quantity range of financial instruments firm order queries from the submitter and so on . Such filtering may prevent information about the firm order from being sent to participants that are unlikely to respond positively to the order. In one implementations firm order submitters may choose from one or more ranges of response rates i.e. number of queries accepted number of queries received which may be referred to as risk pools with which participants must be associated to receive a query e.g. choose from among participants with positive response rates of 1 50 51 70 71 90 and or 91 100 .

Some embodiments may include receiving an indication of desired filters. The indication may be received from one or more traders participant systems or any other desired source. The indication may identify any desired characteristics combination of characteristics exceptions to filters and or any other information related to the filters.

The filters may be applied in a centralized fashions and or a distributed fashion. For example in some implementations filters may be applied before requests are transmitted e.g. by a central system by a distributed system etc. . Applying the filters before transmitting requests may decrease the amount of traffic associated with performing process . Conversely performing such filtering before transmitting may increase the amount of processing performed before transmitting and may involve a participant revealing filtering preference they may not desire to reveal to anyone even a trading system administrator. In other embodiments filtering may occur locally to a participant. By performing such filtering locally more traffic may be generated by a trading system more processing may take place at participants and filtering options may remain private.

In some embodiments participants may be filtered from receiving requests based on the desires of a firm order submitter e.g. by a central system or other participant submitting queries etc. . Such participants may be filtered by identity order availability and or any other desired characteristic. Such filtering may occur for example by the participants themselves e.g. by a participant system configured to perform such filtering in addition to before or otherwise in connection with other participant functions by a central system by a submitting system and or by any other desired system. In some embodiments for example a participant may not be provided with a query if they do not have a matching firm order to fulfill a minimum percentage of a firm order. In other embodiments such information may not be known until after a query is sent and in such embodiments a match may only be determined to exist if the match meets the minimum percentage. Filtering before transmitting queries may decrease an amount of traffic e.g. TCP IP packets transmitted which may be snooped to reveal trading information however a malicious user may snoop such queries in an attempt to determine a filter setting.

In some embodiments participant systems may transmit filtering information to a central system. Such information may be used to perform the filtering at the central system. Such information may also be used to provide information to users entering firm orders as described below.

A trading system that allows such filtering may enable a participant to open traditionally untapped pools of liquidity only to a certain subset of traders. By allowing such limitations the participant opening that pool of liquidity e.g. a set of orders in an OMS may be more confident that the traders gaining access to those pools are not going to use the pools of liquidity for malicious purposes e.g. gaming the market .

As indicated at block process may include determining if a matching order for the firm order query exists. Such determination may include searching one or more database or other listings of OMS orders. The determination may be made at a same or different location as the filtering. Determining may include searching a listing of orders in an OMS of a buy side participant. Such a listing may include all listed orders a subset of listed orders identified as searchable by a trader and or any other orders.

As indicated at block and process may end if it is determined that no matching order exists. Some embodiments may end without providing any indication that no order exists. By not providing specifically identifying that no order exists others e.g. other traders participants people snooping packets etc. may be unable to determine if no order exists or no such response was sent for some other reason e.g. because a trader indicated that no trader should occur as discussed below because a trade was filtered out as discussed above etc. . In some embodiments no indication that the query was received may be presented to a trader or trading system associated with the participant that received the query. By keeping such information secret receivers of queries may be prevented from using the information that the firm order exists to game the market.

As indicated at blocks and if a firm order is determined to exist process may include providing an indication that a firm order has been received. Providing such an indication may include transmitting information over one or more networks from one computer system to another computer system. Providing such an indication may include presenting a user e.g. a buy side trader associated with the OMS order matched with one or more interfaces or icon identifying the firm order. Such an interface may include options to accept a firm order reject a firm order ignore a firm order ignore all firm orders e.g. for a desire period of time and or any other desired options. Such an indication may be considered a non binding indication from the point of view of the participant associated with the OMS in so much as a recipient e.g. a participant associated with the matching OMS order is not bound to fulfill any order based on the indication. However an originator of the firm order may still be bound to fulfill the order if the recipient of the indication chooses to accept the order.

In some embodiments ignoring a firm order may result in a participant opting out of receiving matching using firm order queries for a minimum amount of time. Such an opt out time may encourage participants to accept firm order queries. The time may vary based on characteristics of the order and or participants.

In some embodiments a user may select various options regarding ignoring future indications. For example a user may select that indications should be ignored unless a price associated with the firm order is at a certain level a firm order has some desired characteristic ignore until a certain time ignore for a certain amount of time ignore until the end of the day etc.

In some embodiments evidence that a user has selected to ignore an indication may be suppressed. For example the information may maintained in confidence at a participant system may be kept in confidence at a central system or may otherwise be kept secret. In implementations where different options for ignoring an indication may selected evidence regarding some or all of the information regarding the options may also be suppressed.

As indicated at block process may include awaiting a response from such an indication. Some implementations may include receiving a response and determining if the response is a positive or negative response. In other implementations a response may not be received or may only be received if the response is a positive response. In some embodiments the amount of time to be awaited may be indicated to a trader. In some embodiments the amount of time may vary based on one or more desired characteristics of a security a participant an originator and or other desired entity.

As indicated at block process may include determining if a positive response is received. Determining if a response is a positive response may include determining which if any mouse buttons were pressed which if any keyboard buttons were pressed which interface control if any was selected and or any other determination of a possible entry of intent if any.

As indicated in block process may end if a positive response is not received. In some embodiments after a period of awaiting a presumptive default response may be entered. In some implementations such a default response may include a negative response. In some embodiments an operator of an interface e.g. a trader an administrator etc. may determine the appropriate amount of time and or the appropriate default command.

As indicated at block if a positive response is received process may include facilitating a trade fulfilling at least part of the matching order and at least part of the firm order. Facilitating the trade may include executing the trade clear the trade transmitting information so that the trade is executed and cleared remotely and or any other desired actions. In some implementations facilitating may include providing a positive response e.g. to a central server to a buy side and or sell side participant etc. . The recipient of the positive response may further facilitate the execution of the trade if a trade fulfilling the firm order has not already been executed. Transmission of a positive response may be considered a binding indication of a trade in so much as the participant associated with the OMs order may be bound to fulfill the matching firm order by the indication. In some embodiments the binding may be conditioned on the firm order not having been fulfilled previously not on actions of the participant.

In some implementations process may include receiving an update regarding the facilitation of the execution such an update may include receiving an indication that the execution was completed or that the execution was not completed. In some implementations a trade may be partially completed and an update may indicate that the trade was partially completed. For example a trade may be partially completed if when the positive response is received only part of the firm order is still awaiting execution and the OMS order includes a larger volume for trade. In such a situation a trade may be cancelled in some embodiments in other embodiments a the OMS order may be executed to the extent that the firm order remains and in indication to that extent may be transmitted to the participants in still other embodiments an originator of the OMS order may be contacted with the updated firm order information and or any other action may be taken.

Process may end at block . Process may include notifying one or more participants of a result of the facilitation of the execution of the trade. In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner. Process may be performed by one or more computer systems in a centralized and or distributed fashion.

It should be understood that the process of querying participants is given as one example process only. In various embodiments other methods of pulling order information from one or more OMS may be used. In still other embodiments order information may be pushed from one or more OMS to a central system or other system through which order matching occurs rather than the pulling of order information described in process . In such implementations an OMS and or participant system may be configured to provide OMS order information and updates to a trusted system for order matching to take place without the need for querying.

As indicated at block process may include providing an interface through which one or more of a firm order and or a OMS order may be entered. Such an interface may allow a user to enter information identifying a security a pricing policy a price an amount and or any other information about a desired trade.

Such a trading interface may illustrate information about a percentage number of participants that may view a firm order query associated with an entered order as indicated at . This information may be based on filters established by the participants to filter out orders as described above. Such information may be collected by a central system e.g. from participant systems . One characteristic that may be frequently used to filter orders includes size of the order. The percentage number of participants may reflect the total number of participants willing to accept orders with all characteristics except size and the number willing to accept with the size characteristic. Accordingly order originators may adjust their order size to increase or decrease the number of participants queried.

As indicated in block process may include receiving information about an entered order. The information may include information entered through the provided interface and or any other information e.g. default information identification information etc. .

As indicated at block process may include determining if the order is a firm order. Determining if the order is a firm order may include determining characteristics of an input signal an interface control and or any other information. Some implementations may not include such a determination but rather an interface program computer etc. at which the indication is received or through which information related to the indication is entered may identify the type without a separate action being taken.

As indicated at block if the order is a firm order process may include transmitting e.g. to a central system a distributed system etc. an indication of the firm order for automatic execution against matching orders e.g. matching firm orders previously or later submitted OMS orders etc. . Process may then end at block . In some implementation process may also include receiving information about a matching order and displaying that information through one or more interfaces.

As indicated at block if the order is determined not to be a firm order process may include transmitting a representation of the order to be matched against incoming order queries e.g. by a process such as process . Transmitting may include providing to a different process thread memory location etc. In other embodiments a same program thread server may perform query matching providing interfaces receiving order information and or any other desired acts. As indicated at block process may then end.

In some embodiments process may include receiving information about the order such as whether matching queries are received etc. In some implementations process may be performed for example by a trading computer an OMS system a central system and or a participant server. In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner. Process may be performed by one or more computer systems in a centralized and or distributed fashion. In some embodiments entering OMS orders in such a process may be limited to buy side participants of a market.

As indicated at block process may include receiving an indication that a firm order matches a OMS order. Such an indication may be received from one or more OMS systems participant servers central servers buy side systems sell side systems computer programs computer processes computer threads memory locations network interfaces and or other desired sources.

As indicated at block process may include providing an interface icon and or other indication that a matching order exists. illustrates an example interface that may be used as such an indication in some embodiments. Such an interface as illustrated may display some details of a matching order. Such an interface may allow a trader to indicate a positive response to the order or a negative response to the order e.g. by operating a control such as a button .

Process as indicated at block may include determining if a positive response is received with some time period. In some embodiments the period of time may include a default time period an amount of time according to a user profile an amount of time according to terms of the firm order an amount of time determined in part by a size and or dollar value of the order and or any other desired amount of time. In some implementations receiving a positive response may include receiving an indication that a control was selected. If a positive response is not received process may end at block .

As indicated at block if a positive response is received process may include transmitting a request to execute a trade fulfilling at least part of the firm order and at least part of the matching order. Other embodiments may include otherwise facilitating the execution of such a trade e.g. executing the trade clearing the trade etc. 

Process may end at block . Other embodiments of process may include receiving information about the execution of the trade displaying information about such execution displaying terms associated with a trade displaying information about an originator of a firm order updating maintaining stored order information and or any other desired actions.

In some embodiments multiple firm orders may match a OMS order. In such embodiments an indication of each such matching order may be provided. In some embodiments the indications may be ordered according to a preference mechanism. Such preference mechanism may include ordering based on preferences of an order originator an indication receiver a computer system administrator and or any other preferences of any individual regarding any characteristics of an order computer system trade etc. In some implementations rather than providing separate indications indications may be pooled into a single indication. Such pooling may include combining multiple firm orders according to some preference mechanism so that the firm orders fulfill the matching order. If additional firm orders exist some implementations may separately provide information about such firm orders. In some implementations even if indications are pooled an interface may be provided that allows a user to access information and enter information e.g. acceptance of orders about individual orders.

In some embodiments process may include additional actions fewer actions and or different actions. Process or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized and or distributed manner. Process may be performed by one or more computer systems in a centralized and or distributed fashion. In some embodiments only buy side participants may receive firm order queries for matching against OMS orders.

Processes and are arranged to provide convenient illustration of concepts disclosed herein. It should be recognized that no such processes need be performed at all.

In various embodiments some or all communication may be encrypted. In various embodiments some or all information stored in various media may be encrypted. In some embodiments comparisons among information may be made in an encrypted form. In other embodiments encrypted data may be unencrypted before a comparison occurs.

In some embodiments an encryption algorithm such as the well known PGP RSA encryption method may be used for communication among participants computer systems etc. Advances in quantum computing may make such encryption less secure in the future. Some embodiments therefore may include use of quantum key encryption algorithms designed to overcome such vulnerability and or other future proof encryption algorithms.

In some embodiments different users of a system e.g. central system buy side system sell side system trader computer etc. may have access to different options. Because a market may be asymmetrical providing asymmetrical options to such user types may best capture a dynamic of the market. For example in a security trading market participants may be divided into four example categories which may include hedge funds investors brokers and verified naturals. It should be recognized that other embodiments may include different additional alternative fewer and or no categories of users.

Referring to the example four category embodiment investors may include traders that trade on behalf of their own accounts e.g. individuals . Hedge funds may include organizations exempt from standard securities regulation that typically seek high returns for accredited investors. Brokers may include originations that may trade on behalf of others as regulated by standard securities laws. Verified naturals may include brokers that are not acting one behalf of their own proprietary accounts. To become a verified natural a broker may be required to provide proof that they are not trading on behalf of their own proprietary accounts. In some implementations a single user may act as more than one type of user at various times. For example a broker may act as a broker in some situations and a verified natural in other situations. Options and treatment given to such different categories may reflect a likelihood that the participants may be gaming the market.

In some embodiments information provided to users may depend upon a category or type of user. For example users may be limited to receiving certain firm order queries accepting certain firm order matches etc. based on their category. In one implementation for example only buy side participants only may receive firm order queries. In such situations information about possible trade executions with OMS orders may not be provided to sell side participants until and unless a trade is accepted by a buy side participant and or executed.

In some embodiments as discussed above rebates and charges may be given. In some embodiments such rebates and or charges may depend on a category of participant. For example in some implementations investors may be given a rebate for submitting firm orders. In other implementations anyone submitting a firm order may be given a rebate. In some implementations brokers may be charged a fee for each time a OMS order matches a firm order query. In some implementations brokers can opt out of having their firm orders matched against other brokers firm orders because of pricing rebate that allows brokers to be paid for submitting firm orders.

In some embodiments size or other characteristics of a participant may affect a participants options. Some implementations for example may be limited to large participants others to small participants others may allow all sized participants.

Although some embodiments described above execute trades without a negotiation between participants in the trade e.g. with only a buy or reject ignore option presented to participants with matching OMS orders some embodiments may include a negotiation. Such negotiation may be limited in some embodiments to preserve anonymity encourage entering of OMS orders and or limit the possibility of gaming the market.

In some embodiments for example where there are multiple matching orders a negotiation to determine the counter party that is willing to adjust their offer the most may be performed.

In some embodiments if user accepts a matching firm order found from a query the user and or the originator of the firm order may be presented with an option to trade more of the security. By selecting a control in an interface that activates such an option a negotiation may begin between the two participants. Such a negotiation may include asking if the other party agrees to trade more the terms of such a trade etc. Such negotiation may limit the probability of gaming the market since the participants may already be aware of each other from the prior trade.

Some embodiments may include providing rebates or charging fees to trade participants. Such fees and or rebates may be arranged to incentivize participation in certain aspects of a trading system. For example in some embodiments when an order is executed based on a firm order matched with a OMS order the participant that submitted the firm order may receive a rebate and the participant associated with the OMS order may be charged a fee.

Some embodiments may support various types of trades. Such trades may include buying securities selling securities short selling securities and or any other desired types of trades. In some embodiments in which a short sell of a security is performed a location of a purchased borrowed security may be required before a short sell order may be completed.

Some embodiments may include tracking information about one or more participants. For example a trade history a number of trades a type of trades characteristics of trades etc. may be tracked for buy and or sell side participants. In some information a participant may view some or all of such information about itself and or about other participants. In some embodiments such information may be used to generate a rating of a participant. Such a rating may be used for example as a filter of participants querying a participant server.

It should be recognized that while embodiments described herein generally included a computer human interactions e.g. through an interface other embodiments may be performed completely though a computer e.g. a computer may respond to firm order queries etc. .

It should also be recognized that while embodiments described herein generally included various securities trading other embodiments may be used to trade any desired goods or services.

In some embodiments one or more participants may be given some but not all information about pending orders. Such information may be provided for example as a way of incentivizing the participant to submit an order and or take some action. In some implementations the pending orders may include firm orders and the participants may include participants with orders in an OMS. In other implementations the pending orders may include orders in an OMS and the participants may include any participant e.g. a participant inquiring about present orders a participant with OMS orders a participant with firm orders etc. . In some implementations the participants that are told such information may include buy side participants. In such implementations buy side participants may be given the information for example without having to submit orders of their own after submitting OMS orders related to the pending orders after submitting firm orders related to the pending orders and or after any other desired event.

In some implementations the some information may include information about one or more pending orders that does not include all the information about the pending orders. For example the information may include the fact that one or more orders for a financial instrument are pending. The information may for example withhold which side the orders are for who the orders were submitted by the quantity of the orders the price of the orders and or any other information. In other implementations some or all of such information may be provided and other information may be withheld. In some implementations the information may be sufficient to entice a participant who may be interested in a trade involving the pending orders to perform one or more actions but may be limited so that an effect on behavior of other participants is limited to legitimate trading activity e.g. limit gaming of the market .

In some implementations if the participant that was shown the information takes one or more specific actions additional information about the pending orders may be provided. For example if an order is submitted for the financial instrument if an OMS order is converted to a firm order if a positive response to an OMS query is guaranteed etc. then the remaining information about the pending orders may be provided. Such a method of providing some but not all information before an action is taken may be used to incentive a participant to take a particular action to obtain the remained of information e.g. if the initial information was enticing . In some implementations orders in an OMS order histories and or any other information about a participant may be tracked and used to determine if providing some information may encourage the one or more actions. In some implementations market conditions may be tracked to determine that the one or more actions may provide needed liquidity to a market e.g. may encourage submission of firm orders when they are lacking .

In some embodiments an indication of a non firm order may be received and in response a search for matching orders may be performed. If a matching order is found instead of facilitating execution in response to finding the matching order the non firm order may be confirmed before such facilitation is performed. If such confirmation is received execution of the trade may be facilitated.

Some embodiments may include determining whether a matching order to the non firm order is stored in an order management system and whether an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least a portion of each of the non firm order and the matching order is accepted. As described below such determining may include for example transmitting one or more queries receiving responses and any other actions. In other implementations such determining may include other actions such as searching one or more databases and so on.

In some embodiments after the indication of the non firm order is received one or more queries may be transmitted e.g. using a querying process such as those described above if a matching firm order is not found in parallel with a search for matching firm orders etc. . The queries may ask if a matching order to the non firm order is stored in an order management system e.g. similar to process as indicated at block and or if an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least a portion of each of the non firm order and the matching order is accepted as indicated at block . In some implementations a single query may be transmitted for example to a computer system configured to interpret the single query as asking if the matching order is stored in the order management system and if the matching order is stored in the order management system if the offer is accepted e.g. by a trader associated with the order management system. In some implementations transmitting a query may include transmitting a query to a system configured to determine if a matching order is stored in the order management system determine if an offer to enter into a trade regarding that order is accepted and respond to the query only if the matching order is stored in the order management system and the offer is accepted e.g. a participant system as described above .

In some implementations such querying may include identifying that the order is a non firm order e.g. by color coding an indication provided to a trader by including a text description in an indication provided to a trader by including an icon in an indication provided to a trader by including a flag or other indicator in data transmitted etc. . In other implementations such querying may include treating a non firm order as if it were a firm order e.g. by not identifying that the non firm order is not a firm order by identifying that the non firm order is a firm order by not providing any distinction between firm orders and non firm orders etc .

In some implementations an indication of an acceptance of the non form order may be received e.g. from a participant that was queried as indicated at block . The acceptance of the non firm order may identify that a trader agrees to enter into a trade fulfilling at least part of the firm order and at least part of a matching order stored in an order management system. The acceptance may indicate that the trader agrees to enter into the trade e.g. without any further negotiation etc. .

In response to receiving the indication of the acceptance or otherwise making a determination a request for confirmation of the non firm order may be transmitted to a submitter of the non firm order as indicated at block . A request for confirmation may include a request to respond a request to not respond a request for information identifying whether the submitter is obligated to confirm a request for information identifying circumstances that overcome an obligation to confirm and so on. In some implementations a request to confirm may be similar to a request to accept a firm order in which the firm order includes the matching order.

In some embodiments an indication of a confirmation of the non firm order may be received as indicated at block . The indication may include for example an indication that the trade should occur an indication that the non firm order is still available an indication that the submitter of the non firm order agrees to make the non firm order firm an indication that one or more events has or has not happened an indication of an acceptance of the matching order and or any other indications. In some implementations a confirmation may be similar to an acceptance of a firm order in which the firm order includes the matching order. It should be recognized that in some implementations a non firm order may be considered confirmed if an indication to the opposite is not received. A confirmation may include an agreement to enter into a trade that relates to the non firm order.

In some embodiments if such confirmation is received execution of the trade may be facilitated as indicated at block . If such confirmation is not received the participant may be notified that the trade will not be executed.

In some embodiments those participants that are queried may not desire to respond to non firm order queries because of a possibility that the submitter of the non firm order may reject the trade and use the information about the acceptance by the participant to affect the market. In some embodiments not all traders may be able to submit non firm orders. For example in some embodiments non firm orders may be submitted that meet one or more desired characteristics. Such characteristics may reflect the likelihood that the submitter will game the market and or will confirm an accepted matching order. Some example characteristics may include that the submitter trades on behalf of others that the submitter does not trade based for proprietary purposes that the trader agrees to one or more restrictions and so on. In some embodiments all traders may be able to submit non firm orders and participants may be able to establish filters to block queries from some types of submitters of non firm orders and or only allow queries from some types of submitters of non firm orders.

In some embodiments a submitter of a non firm order may be asked required to agree to one or more restrictions regarding the non firm orders. Such restrictions for example may affect the circumstances of when a submitter of a non firm order may confirm and or not confirm a non firm order and or any other aspect of the confirmation process. In some implementations a submitter of a non firm order may be asked and or required to agree to confirm an order unless the at least one of the order is cancelled and at least a part of the order is fulfilled so that the matching order or a portion of it that is accepted in response to a query is no longer available before at least one the transmission of and the receipt of the request for confirmation. Some implementations may include receiving an indication of such an agreement from a submitter of the non firm order before the submitter is allowed to submit the non firm order. In other implementations other restrictions regarding when a non firm order submitter may not confirm a non firm order may be established. In some implementations such restrictions may only apply for a limited time after submission and or receipt of the non firm order. For example in some implementations such restrictions may only apply for an initial 30 seconds. In some implementations the time period may be similar to a time period for a shot clock as described below. In other implementations there may be no such time period limitation.

Some implementations may include determining whether one or more restrictions are met. Such determining may include receiving information identifying circumstances that meet such restrictions or identify that such restrictions are met. For example in some implementations a determination as to whether or not a non firm order is cancelled may be made based on information received about the cancellation of the non firm order. A non firm order may be cancelled for example if at least one of a request to cancel the non firm order is received from an originator of the non firm order by the submitter of the non firm order a request to cancel the non firm order is processed by the submitter of the non firm order a time period during which the non firm order is scheduled to remain active expires and so on. As another example a determination as to whether or not at least a part of the non firm has been fulfilled. The part of the non firm order may be fulfilled if at least one of an agreement to execute a trade fulfilling the at least the part of the non firm order and another order has been entered into a trade fulfilling the at least the part of the non firm order has been executed an act entering the submitter into a trade fulfilling the at least part of the non firm order and another order has occurred and so on.

In some implementations a submitter of a firm order may be prevented from making a change to a price and or quantity related to a trade. In some implementations a trade may be facilitated without a negotiation regarding the price and or quantity. In some implementations the price and or quantity may be determined at least in part based on information in a non firm order indication a market a machining order a query and or nay other information.

In some embodiments a non firm order submitter may be asked required to respond to confirmation requests within a limited time period. Such a time period may include for example 5 seconds half a second 50 milliseconds etc. In some implementations such a time period may be too small for a human to effectively confirm an order. In such implementations the confirmation process may be computerized e.g. a computer may determine if the order has been cancelled by an originator or was fulfilled otherwise and if not may confirm the order . In some implementations the time period may begin when a request for confirmation is transmitted received and or at any other time. In some implementations the time period may include between about 10 milliseconds and about 1 second. A time period may include a period of time having a beginning and an end point. In some implementations a confirmation may be received within the time period transmitted in the time period and so on.

In some embodiments a non firm order submitter may be asked required to abide by a set of procedures for treatment of non firm order confirmation requests. For example a confirmation requests transmitted to and or received by non firm order submitters may have privacy policies applied to it. For example in some implementations no humans may be allowed to view such confirmation but rather the process of responding to confirmation requests may be computerized. Some implementations may include receiving an indication of an agreement to prevent humans from obtaining information regarding confirmation of non firm orders unless the non firm order is confirmed. In some implementations restrictions on the storage of confirmation requests may be imposed. For example in some implementations computer systems that respond to confirmation requests and or otherwise process portions of such requests may be restricted from storing information about the request from displaying information about the request from transmitting information about the request and so on.

In some embodiments information regarding rejections of confirmation requests may be provided by a non firm order submitter. Such information for example may include documentary proof that one or more circumstances in which a rejection is allowed had occurred e.g. a document showing that an order was cancelled at a certain time a document showing that an order was fulfilled at a certain time etc. . Such information may be used for auditing purposes to ensure that the non firm order submitter is complying with restrictions established for the submission of non firm orders in some implementations. In some implementations if the non firm order submitter violates such restrictions a number of times a fine may be assessed the non firm order submitter maybe restricted from submitting non firm orders and or any other penalty may be provided. In some implementations privacy policies may apply to such information. Such policies may include preventing humans from viewing the information removing stored information from one or more computer systems preventing information from being stored one or more computer systems and so on.

In some embodiments when a query is made to a participant to determine if a matching order is available e.g. stored in an OMS the query may only present a portion of a quantity of a non firm order. For example because there may be a chance that part of the non firm order may be fulfilled otherwise e.g. through another exchange etc. the quantity associated by the firm order may be reduced to reflect a quantity that is likely not to be otherwise fulfilled within a desired period of time. Accordingly an offer to enter into a trade represented by a query may include an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills only a portion of the non firm order. Some implementations may include determining the portion to be presented. As a specific example in one implementation if a non firm order for 100 shares of X stock is received it may be determined that there is a 99 chance that the submitter of the order will still be looking for 90 shares of X stock in 30 seconds so one or more queries maybe transmitted to one or more participants for 90 shares of X stock. In various implementations the percentage of confidence the amount of time and other characteristics may be altered. In some implementations such a determination may be made based on historic data regarding the liquidity of a financial instrument based on current market conditions based on open orders on other exchanges and so on. In some implementations if the remaining portion of a non firm order is left unfulfilled when a confirmation request is sent to the non firm order submitter one or more parties to the trade may be given an option to present the other party with an offer to trade the remaining portion. In some implementations one or more algorithms that include any number of variable inputs some of which are mentioned above may be used to determine a portion to be presented. In some implementations a portion presented may include a portion that is expected to be confirmed by a submitter of the non firm order. The portion expected to be confirmed may include a portion that is likely to be available at a future time e.g. based on an algorithm based on historic information based on a guess and so on .

Some embodiments may include one or more systems interacting with a system configured to perform a method such as one described above. Some implementations may include for example transmitting an indication of a non firm order e.g. after entry into an interface receipt from an originator etc. . Some implementations may include receiving an indication defining a matching firm order to the non firm order. The indication may be received from a system configured to find matching orders in the content of a plurality of order management systems as described above. Some implementations may include determining if the non firm order is available for a tread involving the matching firm order e.g. has not been canceled or otherwise fulfilled . If the order is available some implementations may include transmitting a confirmation e.g. within a time period according to various restrictions that have been agreed to etc. . The confirmation may include an indication that a trade should take place without a negotiation about a price and or quantity. In some implementations an interface or system may prevent a negotiation from taking place by blocking one or more communication medium during the time period for example.

Some embodiments may include interaction with one or more trading systems. In some implementations such trading systems may include alternative trading systems. An alternative trading system may include a non exchange trading venue. A non exchange trading venue may include for example a trading venue in which only secondary trading of financial instruments occurs. An ATS may keep a book of orders determine matches among orders in the book and execute trades. In some embodiments an ATS may include a system that operates in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulation ATS and or Code of federal Regulations . illustrates an example embodiment that may include interaction with one or more ATS. Although examples are described with respect to alternative trading systems it should be recognized that other embodiments may include any trading system including exchanges. An exchange may allow primary and secondary trading of financial instruments. Similar to an ATS an exchange may keep any number of order books regarding any number of financial instruments and or orders. As illustrated in a trading system e.g. an alternative trading system may be coupled to one or more participants through one or more communication networks . Such coupling is discussed above. Operation of example participants and example trading systems are also discussed above. In some embodiments as illustrated the trading system may be coupled to one or more alternative trading systems through one or more communication networks . Each alternative trading system may store information about an order book associated with the alternative trading system . An order book may include a collection of pending orders for one or more financial instruments. An order book may include a queue of orders ordered based on some priority a database of orders keyed based on some priority and or any other collection of orders with any other ordering or lack of ordering. Each alternative trading system may be coupled to one or more customers through one or more communication networks . The customers may submit information about orders and or receive information about orders from the alternative trading systems related to orders that may be and or are stored in an order book . The customers may include computer systems people and or any other entity that may participate in trading. Communication networks and or may include the same or different communication networks. An order book includes at least one of a database a queue a list and a collection.

As indicated at block method may include receiving an indication of order that is pending in an order book e.g. of an alternative trading system e.g. . The indication may be received from the alternative trading system e.g. through a communication network e.g. . The order may define a financial instrument a side of a trade a quantity a price and or any other desired information. In some implementations an order may be pending in an order book of an alternative trading system if the order is stored in the order book. In some implementations an order may be pending in an order book of an alternative trading system if the order has not been cancelled or otherwise fulfilled after it has been received by the alternative trading system.

In some implementations the indication of the order may include an indication that the order is pending in the order book of the alternative trading system. In some implementations such an indication may be treated similarly to a non firm order as described above. For example in some implementations the indication may be an indication that if the trading system identifies a matching order the matching order may be fulfilled if the order has not been cancelled or otherwise fulfilled by another order. In other implementations the indication may include an indication that the order is firm with respect to the trading system e.g. . For example in such implementations if a matching order is identified by the trading system a trade fulfilling the order and the matching order may be facilitated without regard for matching orders pending on the alternative trading system.

As indicated at block method may include determining that a matching order to the order is stored in an order management system and that an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least a portion of each of the order and the matching order is accepted. The matching order may define an opposite side of the trade for the financial instrument. Such a determination may be similar to such determination discussed above e.g. with respect to non firm order .

In some embodiments making such a determination may include transmitting a first query asking if a matching order to the order is stored in an order management system and transmitting a second query asking if an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least a portion of each of the order and the matching order is accepted. Such querying may be similar to the querying discussed above with respect to non firm orders. Such querying may include transmitting a single query as discussed above. In some implementations such querying may include identifying that the order may not be executed by the trading system. In some implementations such querying may include identifying that the order is associated with the alternative trading system. In some implementations such querying may include identifying that the order is not a firm order. In some implementations such querying may include treating the order as if it were a firm order received from a participant e.g. not making any identification otherwise .

In some embodiments making such a determination may include receiving an indication of an acceptance of the offer from a participant. Receiving such an indication may be similar to receiving an indication as discussed above with respect to non firm orders.

In some embodiments the indication of the order may identify a quantity of a financial instrument to be trading. Determination may include determining if a matching order with a smaller quantity is available. Similar to the non firm orders discussed above determining the availability of orders for only a portion of the quantity may result in fewer instances of an offer being accepted but a trade not being executed. In some implementations a determination of the portion may be made. Such a determination may be made based on a likelihood of a quantity of financial instruments related to the order being available as discussed above with respect to non firm orders. In some implementations the portion may be based on an expected amount of time to communicate with the alternative trading system. For example if the time is a long time the opportunity that a cancellation or other fulfillment of the order occurs during transmission may be greater so the portion may be smaller. If the time is a short time the opportunity that a cancellation or other fulfillment of the order occurs during transmission may be less so the portion may be larger. The time may be based on a speed of communication networks a number of hops between source and destination of transmission a protocol s requirements for confirmation and or any other information. Because alternative trading systems generally operate at a much faster rate and with much more bandwidth than typical computer systems the portion may be larger than in some non firm order embodiments discussed above. Other characteristics may be used to determine the portion and some implementations may include a full quantity.

As indicated at block method may include transmitting an indication that the trade should be executed to the alternative trading system. Such an indication may be transmitted through a communication network to the alternative trading system. Such an indication may identify that a trade that fulfills at least a part of the order pending in the order book and at least part of the matching order should be executed. In some implementations such an indication may be transmitted in response to receiving the indication of the acceptance as discussed above.

In some implementations the alternative trading system may execute the trade or otherwise facilitate execution of the trade if the order is still available e.g. if the order has not been cancelled or otherwise fulfilled . In some implementations the alternative trading system may provide a information about the execution of the trade to the trading system and or to the participant taking part in the trade. Such information may identify whether the trade has been executed or not.

Some embodiments may include receiving orders from a plurality of different alternative trading systems. Some embodiments may include determining that respective matching orders are stored in respective order management systems and that offers to enter into respective trades for the orders are accepted. Some embodiments may include transmitting respective indications that respective trades should be executed to respective alternative trading systems for each order. Such transmission may occur in response to a determination regarding the respective matching order.

As indicated at block method may include receiving an indication of one or more orders. An order may define a side of a trade for a financial instrument. The indication may be received for example from a customer of the alternative trading system. Such a customer may include a sell side trader any other person or system that desires to trade a financial instrument using the alternative trading system and or any other entity. The indication may be received through a communication network e.g. .

As indicated at block method may include storing information about the one or more orders in an order book of an alternative trading system. Storing such information may include placing the information in a database a list a queue and or any other structure in which order information may be stored. In some implementations storing such information may include placing the information in a queue of orders for the financial instrument. In some implementations if a matching order is received by the alternative trading system the next order in the queue of orders may used to trade against the matching order. Such an order book may be associated with a matching engine that determines if matching orders are pending and facilitates the execution of such orders. A matching engine may include software and or hardware that facilitates determinations of matches between orders for a financial instrument.

As indicated at block method may include transmitting an indication of an order to a trading system e.g. . Such an indication may be transmitted through a communication network e.g. . The indication may be similar to the indication received at block as discussed above.

As indicated at block method may include receiving an indication of an acceptance of an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least part of the order. The indication may be received from the trading system. Such an indication be similar to the indication transmitted at block discussed above. The indication may identify information about a matching order sufficient to allow the alternative trading system to execute a trade involving the order and the matching order. The indication may indicate that the trade should be executed. The indication may indicate that the trade should be executed if one or more conditions are met. In some implementations such conditions may include that the order is available. In some implementations such conditions may include that the order has not been cancelled and or that the order has not been previously fulfilled. In some implementations the matching order may fulfill only a portion of the order. In other implementations the matching order may fulfill the entire order.

As indicated at block method may include determining if the order is available. In some implementations determining if the order is available may include determining if the order is in the order book e.g. by searching the order book . In some implementations determining if the order is available may include determining if the order has been cancelled. In some implementations determining if the order is available may include determining if the order has been otherwise fulfilled e.g. by a previous order that was identified by the alternative trading system . An order may have been otherwise fulfilled for example if another matching order was previously submitted to the alternative trading system before the matching order was identified by the trading system.

Some embodiments may include determining if an acceptance is identified by the trading system before a matching order is identified by the alternative trading system. Some embodiments may include determining if an acceptance is identified by the alternative trading system before a matching order is identified by the trading system. Identifying an order or an acceptance may include ant action that makes the existence of the order or the acceptance consequential. For example a matching order may be identified when an indication of the matching order is received by the first alternative trading system the matching order is stored in the order book a matching engine of the first alternative trading system identifies that the matching order and the first order match the first order is removed from the order book the matching order is processed by the first alternative trading system and or any other desired action occurs. As another example an acceptance may be identified when an indication of the acceptance is received by the second alternative trading system an indication of the acceptance is transmitted from the second alternative trading system to the first alternative trading system an indication of the acceptance is received by the first alternative trading system the indication of the acceptance is processed by the first alternative trading system and or any other desired action occurs.

In some embodiments if an acceptance of an offer to enter into a trade that fulfills at least part of the order is identified by the trading system before a matching order to the order is identified by the alternative trading system the trade may be executed. In some embodiments if the matching order to the order is identified by the alternative trading system before the acceptance is identified by the trading system a trade that fulfills at least part of the matching order and the order may be executed. In some embodiments if a cancellation is identified before either the acceptance or the matching order neither trade may be executed.

As indicated at block method may include facilitating execution of the trade that fulfills at least part of the order if it is determined that the order is available. Various examples of facilitating execution are discussed herein. In some implementations the alternative trading system may execute the trade.

Some embodiments may include providing information about the execution to one or more customers participants the trading system and or any other entity.

Some embodiments of a trading system e.g. may require and or ask an operator of an alternative trading system to accept certain restrictions before participating in a method such as method and or method . In some such implementations the restrictions may include for example that if an acceptance of a trade related to an order is identified through the trading system before either an order is cancelled or otherwise fulfilled that the trade will be executed. The restriction may include that the alternative trading system is used for non proprietary trading e.g. at least some primarily to some degree exclusively etc. . Some implementations may be limited to alternative trading systems that meet some or all such requirements. Some implementations of an alternative trading system may include providing an indication of an agreement to such restrictions. Some implementations of a trading system may include receiving such an indication. Similar indications are discussed above with respect to non firm orders.

In some embodiments an alternative trading system may transmit information about all orders to a trading system some orders to a trading system orders that meet certain characteristics to the trading system and or any other set or subset of orders associated with the alternative trading system to the trading system. For example in some implementations an alternative trading system may transmit indication about orders that are for financial instruments that are not traded frequently through the alternative trading system to the trading system. In other implementations an alternative trading system may transmit indication about orders over a particular size to the trading system. In still other implementations an alternative trading system may transmit indications about orders for financial instruments for which there are over a certain number of orders pending in the alternative trading system to the trading system. In other implementations any set of characteristics may be used to determine if any all and or which orders should be transmitted to a trading system. In some implementations an operator of the alternative trading system may establish such characteristics and may control the alternative trading system to provide only such desired information.

In some implementations a trading system may have direct and or semi direct access to an order book of an alternative trading system. Such access may include for example access to a copy of the order book access to a database or other representation of the order book and or any other access to the order book and or a copy of the order book. The trading system may obtain information about orders in the order book using such access. In such implementations the trading system may not wait for indications from the alternative trading system but may proactively search the order book for order information. Such searching may be performed for example by querying a database querying a copy of an order book transmitting a query to an alternative trading system and or performing any other actions. In some implementations an alternative trading system may receive and process a query. Processing a query may be part of a process for responding to queries. In some implementations an operator of an alternative trading system may establish characteristics related to order that may be obtained from the order book by the trading system similar to the characteristics discussed above. The trading system may follow such characteristics in determining which orders in the order book to obtain.

In some implementations access to an order book may be provide through an SSL link. In some implementations access to an order book may involve authentication to a trading system that maintains the order book. Such authentication may include authentication using a password an IP address a username and or any other information.

In some embodiments trading system may be coupled to a plurality of other trading systems. The trading system may allow the other trading systems to access orders received by the trading system e.g. accessing an order book transmitting information about orders in an order book etc. . In some implementations such a trading system may determine which of the plurality of trading systems first identifies a matching order to an order e.g. base don information received from one or more of the trading systems . Based on such a determination the trading system may execute a trade that fulfills at least part of the order. The trade may also fulfill at least part of a matching order that was identified first by a trading system e.g. one of the plurality and or the trading system .

It should be recognized that and are provided as examples only and that other embodiments may include different methods and or systems.

In some embodiments a firm order submitter may have restrictions placed on their actions during a period of time after transmission and or receipt of such orders. For example for a period of time after an indication of a firm order defining a side of a trade is received the submitter of the firm order may be constrained from cancelling the firm order for a first period of time. The amount of time may include an amount of time that may allow a participant to be queried and respond. In some implementations such time may include for example between about 20 seconds and about 1 minute about 5 seconds and so on.

In some implementations if the firm order during that first time period is accepted a trade fulfilling at least a portion of the order may be facilitated even if a request to cancel the order has been received before the acceptance. If queries are rejected during that time the firm order may still not be cancelled until the time period ends.

In some embodiments after the first time period cancellation of the firm order may be allowed if a matching order is not determined to be stored in an order management system and or if a participant is nor determined to accept the order before the first time period expired i.e. ends .

In some implementations constraining may include limiting the ability to perform an act of cancellation. For example constraining may include not allowing an action to occur in a time period e.g. preventing an action from occurring . Constraining may include imposing a penalty for taking an action. Some implementations for example may fine a participant for cancelling in the first time period. Some implementations may prevent a cancellation in the first time period completely. Some implementations may place restrictions on cancellation in the first time period that are not placed after the first time period. In some implementations if a request to cancel is received during the first time period for example it may be ignored. In some implementations if a request to cancel is received during the first time period the request may be queued until the first time period ends and may be processed at the end of the first time period e.g. the order may be cancelled if it was not accepted before the end of the first time period . In some implementations cancellation may include cancelling an order revoking an order invalidating an order and so on. In some implementations allowing may include letting an act happen with a penalty or without a constraint.

In some implementations by constraining cancellation of the firm order during the time period information leakage about orders pending in an OMS may be prevented. For example in other implementations a firm order may be cancelled after either a it is determined that no matching orders are present with any participants or b all queries sent to participants with matching orders are negatively responded to or a time period passes. In some implementations option a may take a short a mount of time e.g. less than a second and option b may take a variable amount of time depending on how quickly the participants respond to queries. Accordingly if option a occurs then the firm order submitter will be able to cancel orders quickly but if option b occurs then the firm order submitter will not be able to cancel orders until some time longer amount of time passes. By tracking such time the firm order submitter may be able to tell whether there were matching orders pending or not based on how long the wait to cancel was. By requiring a standard level e.g. 20 seconds 1 minute etc. before cancellation is allowed firm order submitters may not be able to tell the difference between these different situations and therefore less information about the contents of OMS may be leaked to firm order submitters. An indication of a remainder of the time period may be shown to a submitter e.g. though an interface . An indication of the end of the time period may be shown to a submitter e.g. through an interface . In some implementations a standard time period determined before an indication of an order is received may be used as the first time period.

In some embodiments a time period during which cancellation is constrained may be randomly determined for one or more firm orders. Such random time period may simulate a time period for reply of a participant. In some implementations the time period may be randomly determined between a minimum and maximum period of time e.g. between 5 seconds and 20 seconds 1 minute etc. . In some implementations such time period may be shown to the submitter of the firm order e.g. through an interface as a counting down clock etc. . In some implementations an indication that the end of the period is reached may be sent to the submitter e.g. in addition to the time period instead of the time period by changing a color by playing a tone through an interface and so on .

In some embodiments an indication of an amount of time remaining in the first time period and or whether the first time period has passed may be transmitted to one or more participants. In some embodiments the amount of time remaining in the time period before the order may be cancelled may be shown to a recipient of a query e.g. a clock may be shown in an interface window a query may include the indication etc. . In some implementations an indication that the time period has ended may be shown to the recipient of a query e.g. a window may change colors an icon may be shown an amount of time remaining may be shown etc. . In some implementations an indication of the query may be removed from an interface after the end of the time period e.g. a window may be closed or removed from an interface . In some implementations the recipient may respond to the query after the time period but the firm order may be cancelled before such response is processed. In some implementations if the firm order is cancelled an indication of the query may be removed e.g. removed from an interface a window may be closed etc. .

In some embodiments an indication of whether the first time period has passed may be provided to a submitter of the firm order. Such an indication may include an amount of time until the time period ends an indication that the time period has not passed an indication that a time period has changed and so on.

Some implementations may include a system configured to interface with a system such as those describe above. In some implementations for example information about a firm order may be accepted e.g. through an interface . In some implementations an indication of the firm order may be transmitted e.g. to a system configured to find matching orders to firm orders in the content of a plurality of order management systems . Some implementations may include providing an indication of a time period during which the firm order may not be cancelled e.g. through an interface to a trader that submitted information about the firm order and so on . Some implementations may include receiving an indication of the time period e.g. from a system to which the order was submitted etc. . In some implementations the indication may include a color coding of an interface an indication of an amount of time remaining in the first time period and so on.

In some embodiments a cancellation of an order may be constrained as discussed above and or in any other way. When an order is submitted some embodiments may determine whether cancellation should be constrained for that order. Determining whether cancellation should be constrained may include determining whether a number of orders has been submitted prior to the order. The number of orders ay include orders that meet certain criteria some of which are discussed below. In other implementations a determination about cancellation constraining may be randomly made. For example each order may have a 10 chance of having cancellation constrained. A random number generator or other method of random selection may determine that the order should or should not have cancellation constrained. It should be recognized that any method of making such a determination may be used and that examples are non limiting.

In some implementations that constrain cancellation of an order after a number of orders have been submitted may keep a count of orders submitted. For example such embodiments may constrain cancellation of every 20order submitted. In some implementations Cancellation of the other e.g. non 20orders orders may not be constrained. In some implementations cancellation of the other orders may not be constrained unless a matching order to the other orders has been identified e.g. in an order management system . Such constraining for the other orders may be for a period of time that gives the participant associated with the order management system a chance to accept or reject the order. Cancellation of the order e.g. the 20order may be constrained even if a matching order is not identified. Accordingly a submitter of the order may not know whether a match is found based on whether cancellation is constrained.

In some implementations a number of other orders may be submitted. The other orders may be treated as described elsewhere herein. In some implementations the number may be any desired number. For example the number may be 20 orders. In some implementations the number may be a random number. The number may be determined periodically. The number may be determined randomly. The number may be determined to simulate random market actions.

In some implementations the other orders may all be submitted from a same submitter e.g. the same submitter as the order e.g. the 20order . Each submitter may be tracked to determine whether the number has been submitted by the submitter. In other implementations the number may be submitted from different submitters.

In some implementations the other orders may include all orders submitted e.g. by one submitter by many submitters . In other implementations the other orders may include orders that meet one or more criteria. For example in some implementations the other orders may include only orders that have not been fulfilled e.g. within a time period after submission . In some implementations the other orders may include orders for which at least one of i no matching order has been found in an order management system and ii no offer to enter into a trade for the order was accepted.

Some embodiments may include determining that no matching order is stored in the order management system associated with any of the plurality of participants for one or more of the other orders. In such an implementation each of such other orders may not have their cancellation constrained. In some such implementations each of such other orders may have their cancellation constrained only until the determination is made but not past that point. Such a determination may take about 100 milliseconds or less.

In some implementations a determination of whether a matching order is stored in an order management system may be made. In some implementations a database of orders may be searched to make such a determination. In some implementation such a determination may be made for example based on whether an indication that a matching order is stored in the order management system has been received. In some implementations a participant may be queried as discussed elsewhere herein. In some implementations the participant may be configured to transmit an indication that a matching order is stored in an order management system. Such an indication may be sent regardless of whether an offer has been accepted unlike some embodiments discussed herein.

In some embodiments all orders may have cancellation constrained for an initial determination to be made. The time to make the determination may be minimal e.g. less than about 100 ms . In some implementations to make the determination participants may be queried. Each participant may respond with an indication that a matching order is or is not stored in an order management system associated with the respective participant. In some implementations a lack of response may be an indication of a default value e.g. no response before the end of some initial period means no matching order is stored . In some implementations if a determination is made that any of the participants has a matching order stored in an order management system cancellation of the order may be constrained for a period of tie to allow the participant to accept the order if desired. If a determination is made that no matching orders are stored then cancellation ay be allowed after that determination is made. In some implementations that cancellation may be constrained as if the determination that the matching order was stored was made in some circumstances e.g. if such a constraining decision is made as described above if a number of prior orders have been submitted etc. . Such constraining may make it difficult for a submitter to determine whether a matching order was found or not.

As mentioned above in some embodiments if it is determined that an order is stored in an order management system of a participant cancellation may be constrained for a time period so that the participants may respond to an offer. The time period may be about 5 seconds. In some embodiments if it is determined that no such order is stored in the order management system then cancellation may not be constrained except under certain circumstances as discussed herein.

Some embodiments may include determining that none of the plurality of participants accepts an offer to enter into the respective first trade defined by one or more of the number of orders. Such a determination may be made based on whether an indication that such an acceptance to an offer has been received e.g. from a participant as discussed above .

In some embodiments the other orders may be limited to orders with one set of criteria or more than one set of criteria in any combination. For example in some embodiments the number may be accepted orders order without matching orders and orders with matching orders that are unaccepted. In other implementations the orders may be any subset or other set of such orders. Orders that do not meet such criteria in some implementations may not be included in a count of orders to determine if a constraint should be made to cancellation of the order.

As discussed above if cancellation is determined to be constrained cancellation may be constrained during a first time period and allowed after the first time period. As discussed above the time period may be a random time period. In other implementations the time period may be a fixed time period e.g. about 5 seconds .

In some implementations a determination that no orders matching orders are stored in order management systems associated with a plurality of participants may be made before an end of the first time period. Such a determination may have no affect on the ending of the time period. Rather in some implementations the constraining may continue despite there being no matching orders available for the order.

It should be recognized that various examples above are non limiting and other methods of constraining orders may be used. Such constraining may limit an order submitter s ability to determine whether a matching order exists based on his or her ability to cancel an order.

In some embodiments one or more funds e.g. mutual funds bond funds stock funds index funds actively managed funds commodities funds exchange traded funds etc. may participate.

Some such funds may use OMS systems and may participate in a similar way as other participants with OMS systems as described above e.g. buy side participants . Other fund participants may not use such OMS systems and or may not want to provide access to such OMS systems. In some embodiments a publication of a fund composition may be used to determine what types of queries and or other information to transmit to fund participant.

In some embodiments an indication of a composition of a fund may be received e.g. over a communication network as a printed publication of a fund prospectus and so on . The composition of the fund may include a plurality of financial instruments that are owned by a fund e.g. a listing of stocks owned by a mutual fund and so on . The composition may include an amount of each financial instrument owned or desired to be owned by the fund. The composition may include a target percentage of the fund made up of each financial instrument. The composition may include a snap shot view of the fund at a particular time at a desired future time and so on.

The indication of the composition may include any information from which at least a portion of a composition of a fund may be determined. For example a composition of a fund may include a written statement of the desired composition of the target composition of the fund such as may be found in a published prospectus. In some embodiments an indication of a composition may be obtained directly from an operator of a fund from a website that tracks fund information from a third party and so on. The indication may include information from a plurality of sources that taken together identify the composition.

An interest in trading related to a particular financial instrument may be approximated determined based on the composition of the fund and or any other information e.g. price changes . For example in some implementations one or more orders to buy or sell a financial instrument may be received. For one or more such orders a determination may be made if the financial instrument defined by the order is part of the composition of the fund. Such a determination may include comparing the financial instrument to the composition e.g. searching the composition for the financial instrument searching a database and so on . If the financial instrument is part of the composition of the fund a query may be transmitted asking if a fund operator e.g. anything or one that has the capacity to enter into trades on behalf of the fund desires to enter into a trade fulfilling the order and a matching order for the financial instrument. Transmitting the query may in some implementations include querying an order management system of the fund as described above transmitting a query to a trader or machine operated by a trader and or soliciting an acceptance in any other way.

In some implementations queries may only be sent to a fund if the composition indicates that the fund holds a certain amount of a financial instrument. For example a query asking if the fund is interested in a trade to sell a financial instrument may only be sent to the fund if the composition indicates that the fund holds enough of the financial instrument to fulfill the order. In some implementations a query may only be sent if the fund holds some other threshold amount of the financial instrument e.g. a million shares holds some minimum percentage of the threshold instrument e.g. 10 of the makeup of the fund is the financial instrument the financial instrument is one of the top number of financial instruments that make up the fund e.g. 1 of the top 10 constituents of the fund and or any other set of filters may be used.

In some implementations changes in price of one or more financial instruments in the composition of a fund may be used to determine whether to query a fund regarding a trade. For example in some embodiments a change to a price of a financial instrument defined by an order may be determined. Such a change in price may be based on the time when the composition was received a time that the composition identifies and so on. Such a change may be determined based on historic and current information about a price of the financial instrument e.g. such information may be received from a third party such as a stock tracker a marketplace and so on .

In some embodiments based on a determined change in price a determination of whether an operator of a fund is likely to be interested in a trade that matches the trade defined by a received order may be made. The operator may be likely to be interested if a current situation indicates that there is a heightened chance that an operator would accept an offer for a trade. Operators may attempt to keep a fund close to or at the composition levels based on value of the holding of each financial instrument in the composition so when a price increases or decreases the relative value of the holdings of that financial instrument may be changed and a sale may be desired to return the composition to the target level. Determining if the operator is likely to be interested in the opposite side of the trade for the financial instrument includes determining if the price change includes an increase or a decrease in price. For example if a price change includes an increase in price then the operator may be determined to likely be interested if the order includes a sale of the financial instrument. If the price change includes a decrease in price then the operator may be determined to be likely to be interested if the order includes a buy of the financial instrument. Some implementations may take into account changes in the prices of other financial instruments in the composition with respect to the financial instrument. Some implementations may take into account a relative change in price of the financial instrument with respect to changes in price of other financial instruments in the composition e.g. to determine if a sale or purchase may be needed to return a composition to a target level .

If the operator of the fund accepts an order an indication of an acceptance may be transmitted from the fund. The acceptance may be received by some embodiments. As described above a trade may be facilitated in response to receiving the acceptance.

Some embodiments may perform allow filtering of participants based on the participants prior actions. For example in some embodiments when a participant is queried regarding an order the response of the participant may be tracked. Participants may be arranged into groups based on the frequency of positive responses to queries. For example participants may be arranged into groups as follows participants with 100 to 75 positive response rate participants with 75 to 50 positive responses and participants with less than 50 positive responses. It should be recognized that these groups are given as an example only and that other embodiments may include any number of groups and any arrangement of groups. Such groups may be referred to as risk pools. Submitters of orders may indicate that queries regarding the orders should be sent to participants in one or more of the groups and or not to participants in one or more of the groups. Because sending a query to a participant reveals information about an order the submitter of the order may use the response rate to limit exposure of that information to participants that are historically likely to respond positively.

In some embodiments a plurality of sets of queries may be transmitted to a plurality of participants. Each set of queries may ask the plurality of participants about a respective order. Each query of each set of queries may ask a respective participant if a respective matching order to the respective order is stored in a respective order management system associated with the respective participant and if the respective participant accepts a respective offer to enter into a respective trade that fulfills at least a portion of each of the order and the respective matching order. If the participant accepts the offer a positive response indication of the acceptance may be received. In some implementations if the matching order is stored in the order management system an indication of that storage may be received. Accordingly in some implementations it may be determined from this information if the matching order is stored in the order management system and if it is stored whether or not it was rejected or accepted. If the order is accepted some implementations may include facilitating execution of the trade. In other embodiments as described above queries to order management systems may not be used but rather databases may be searched or any other methods may be used.

In some embodiments the plurality of participants may be assigned to one or more risk pools based on the results of the querying. Each risk pool may correspond to at least one rate of positive responses to offers to enter into trades. The rate of positive responses may for example include a comparison e.g. a ratio a percentage etc. between a number of positive responses and a number of offers e.g. offers with a characteristic offers associated with a submitter and so on . Such a rate for example may correspond to offers made to participants if the matching order is stored in the order management system to all queries sent to participants and or to queries orders having one or more characteristics. In some implementations a rate of positive responses includes a rate of positive responses to all offers to enter into a trade when a matching order is stored in an order management system. In some implementations a rate of positive responses includes a rate of positive responses to offers to enter into a trade when a matching order is stored in an order management system and a query is associated with the submitter. In some implementations a rate of positive responses includes a rate of positive responses to offers to enter into a trade when a matching order is stored in an order management system and associated with an order having at least one similar characteristic to the order. In some implementations such a characteristic may include a financial instrument a quantity range a price range a market capitalization an industry and a financial instrument type.

In some embodiments a submitter of an order may be allowed to identify one or more risk pools to which queries regarding the order should and or should not be transmitted. For example a submitter may use an interface to identify such information may transmit an electronic message identifying such information may establish default risk pools that identify such information and or may identify such information in any other way. Some implementations may include providing an interface through which the one or more risk pools may be selected. Queries regarding the order may subsequently be made to participants in accordance with such information.

Some embodiments may include submitting one or more orders and or indications identifying risk pools. Some embodiments may include receiving an indication of a plurality of risk pools. Such an indication may be presented to a person though an interface to allow selection from among the plurality of risk pools. Some implementations may include receiving a selection of at least one risk pool e.g. through an interface through an electronic message etc. . Some implementations may include transmitting an indication that participants associated with the at least one selected risk pool should be queried regarding an order e.g. through an electronic message etc. . Some implementations may include receiving an indication that execution of a trade fulfilling an order has been facilitated. Some implementations may include providing an indication of such a facilitation e.g. as a display on an interface to a person as an electronic message etc. .

It should be recognized that risk pools may be combined with any other implementations and or concepts described herein and that any methods and or apparatus may be used in various embodiments.

In some embodiments one financial instrument may be substitute for another financial instrument. A substitutable financial instrument may include an instrument that is replaceable for another instrument e.g. fulfills a same reason for existence has similar characteristics and so on . For example if an order is for a first financial instrument a second financial instrument may be used to fulfill the order instead of the first financial instrument. The order may be an order pending in an order management system an order submitted by a sell side participant and or any other type of order. For example a participant that desires to buy stock in a soda company may enter an order for Coca Cola however the order may be fulfilled with stock for PepsiCo that fulfills the desire to buy stock in a soda company bonds in Coca Cola derivatives related to Coca Cola a futures contract for soda and so on. Various criteria tests may be used to establish if one financial instrument is substitutable for another financial instrument. Participants may identify which financial instruments are substitutable for each other. Exchange rates between financial instruments may be established based on prices and or desires of the various participants.

As described above some embodiments may include receiving an indication of an order. The order may define a side of a trade for a first financial instrument. The indication may include an identification of one or more other financial instruments that may be substituted for the first financial instrument to fulfill the order. The identification may include identification of characteristics of such other financial instruments e.g. market cap industry type of instrument etc. a specific enumeration of the other financial instruments and or any other information from which such other financial instruments may be determined. In some implementations such characteristics may include an industry a type of financial instrument and a market capitalization a company and or any other characteristics.

As discussed above some embodiments may include determining if a matching order is stored in an order management system associated with a participant. As described above such determination may include transmitting one or more queries. The matching order may be for the first financial instrument or may be for another financial instrument. For example in some implementations the matching order may be for a different financial instrument that is substitutable for the first financial instrument. The order management system may identify what financial instruments are substitutable for the financial instrument for which the matching order is for. For example the first financial instrument may be stock in Coca Cola and the matching order may be for stock in PepsiCo. The order management system may identify that Coca Cola is substitutable for PepsiCo. Such identification may be made directly through a list of substitutable instruments may be made through asset of characteristics that identify substitutable instruments and or in any other way.

In some implementations if an order is for a quantity of a first financial instrument and a trade fulfilling the order is for a substitutable financial instrument the quantity of instruments traded and or the price at which the instruments are traded may not be the same as those identified by the order for the first financial instrument. For example an order for 100 shares of Coca Cola may be fulfilled by a trade for 50 shares of PepsiCo. The quantity and or price at which a trade takes place may be identified by an order management system e.g. the OMs may identify a set of exchange rates between the financial instruments . The quantity and or price at which the trade takes place may be identified from a market price e.g. the market price of the two financial instruments may be used to determine an exchange rate between them the most recent trade price a current bid and or offer a midpoint price etc. . The price and or quantity may be determined in any other way.

As discussed above a trader may be presented with an offer to enter into a trade. The trade may include a trade for the first financial instrument even if the matching order is for a different financial instrument. In other implementations the trade may include the other financial instrument even if the order is for the first financial instrument. The trader may accept or reject such an offer.

In some embodiments an acceptance of the order may be received e.g. if the trader accepts the offer . The acceptance may indicate that a trade fulfilling an order should be executed. In response to receiving the acceptance execution of a trade fulfilling an order may be facilitated.

From the point of view of a participant with an order in an order management system an indication may be received for an order for a first financial instrument. A determination may be made that a matching order for a second financial instrument that is substitutable for the first financial instrument is stored in the order management system. A trader may be solicited for a binding acceptance to enter into a trade that fulfills the order and the matching order. Some implementations may include providing an interface through which the binding acceptance may be requested transmitting a request for the binding acceptance e.g. through an electronic message and or any other method of soliciting a binding acceptance. The trade may be for the first financial instrument even though the matching order is for a different financial instrument. In other implementations the trade may be for the other financial instrument even though the order is for the first financial instrument. Only if an acceptance is received e.g. though an interface from the trader etc. execution of the trade may be

It should be recognized that substitutability may be combined with any other implementations and or concepts described herein and that any methods and or apparatus may be used in various embodiments.

Numbering of elements in the below section may not match to numbering of elements in the previous sections.

For example no definitions below should be applied to disclosure above unless explicitly stated otherwise and descriptions of preference do not apply to above disclosed embodiments.

Although computers are heavily used to facilitate trading of securities manual intervention may still be required at certain steps in the trading process. For example most traders at institutional investment management firms record their orders to purchase or sell securities in computerized order management systems OMS s . However one or more traders at each firm may manually review the orders in the OMS and attempt to fill the orders by contacting one or more market intermediaries. Typically the traders transmit the orders in the OMS by telephone or separate data entry links to registered broker dealers for the securities to electronic marketplaces that trade the securities or to other market intermediaries. Accordingly manual effort is often required to actually execute the orders in the OMS.

One problem arising from this manual effort is that institutional traders may be unable to execute trades involving large quantities of securities without adversely affecting the market price of the securities. For example institutional traders often need to trade large quantities of securities due to the continuing need of investment managers to respond to changes in market conditions by altering the contents of their investment portfolios. As these portfolios increase in size due to increased investor activity the corresponding quantity of securities to be traded in order to achieve a similar portfolio balance also increases. Market impact costs or adverse costs resulting from the institutional traders activities rise in such circumstances because locating parties with whom to trade such large quantities of securities becomes more difficult for the market intermediaries.

Moreover if the market intermediaries become aware that an institutional firm wants to say sell a large block of a particular equity security this awareness is likely to lower the sale price that the institutional firm can obtain due to the normal processes of supply and demand. The effect is also likely to be exacerbated by speculation from others with knowledge of the order as to why the particular investor wishes to sell such a large quantity of the security. Similarly if market intermediaries become aware of the fact than an institutional firm wants to buy a large block of a particular equity security this awareness will likely increase the purchase price that the institutional firm will have to pay. This adverse effect on price is further exacerbated by the fact that traditional market intermediaries trade for their own accounts.

One strategy commonly employed by institutional traders to offset market impact costs is to spread out trade orders for a large quantity of a security into small orders each handled by a different market intermediary sometimes over several trading days. Of course this strategy brings about its own problems in that the market price can change significantly during this extended trading period due to the unforeseeable activities of others.

Another strategy that may be employed is to spread the orders for the security among one or more electronic marketplaces. However the traders may need to manually transmit each order to the electronic marketplaces using a telephone or a separate data entry link. The fact that the traders may need to perform these extra steps which include duplicate entry of basic order data already recorded in the OMS causes many traders to use these electronic marketplaces infrequently and to supply the marketplaces with only a small subset of the total orders. As a result these electronic marketplaces often lack the liquidity required by a trader to timely execute orders.

The lack of integration between the OMS and the electronic marketplaces also poses problems when an institutional trader wishes to trade a particular security simultaneously within an electronic marketplace and for example over the telephone with a traditional broker. For example some electronic marketplaces attempt to find matches at only specific time intervals. If a trader wishes to buy 100 000 shares of IBM and has placed an order for half that amount in an electronic marketplace the trader will not know how much if any IBM stock was purchased until after the next scheduled match attempt. In the meantime the trader potentially could have purchased more than 50 000 shares from a broker over the phone at a better price.

Therefore there is a need in the art for an electronic trading marketplace that does not require a significant amount of manual intervention by traders or other parties offers anonymity and offers a high amount of liquidity.

Some embodiments address the above need by providing for the automated transmission of orders i.e. without manual trader intervention from the various order management systems OMS s used by investment management firms or other entities having trading systems to an electronic trading marketplace ETM . A firm with a trading system stores information about orders in an OMS to manage its order flow to monitor the initiation placement and execution of orders and for related purposes. Software providing the functionality of an OMS is well known in the art.

OMS interfacing modules OIMs at the firms may automatically transmit orders from the OMS s to the ETM and preferably update the OMS s in response to orders executed at the ETM. Traders can communicate with the ETM to anonymously negotiate trades of securities. As used herein a security is an ownership or creditorship interest such as a stock certificate bond or any other financial instrument contract or transaction such as a forward futures option put call collar swap or currency contract on any security. This description uses the term security for convenience but it should be understood that the term covers financial instruments generally. It should also be understood that other embodiments may be used for trading of other goods and or services.

The ETM may include an OMS data integration module ODIM for receiving and processing data representative of orders received from the OIMs. In a preferred embodiment the data from the OIMs are provided to the ETM in a standardized format that requires little processing by the ODIM. The orders processed by the ODIM may be stored in an ETM database.

A negotiation module in the ETM may support negotiations between traders. In one embodiment an indications module transmits orders received by the ETM among the traders based upon filtering criteria established by the traders and or the ETM. These orders are transmitted among the traders in the form of non binding indications. Based upon these indications traders at one institution can enter into negotiations with traders at other institutions through the negotiation module of the ETM. In one embodiment at least parts of the negotiations are conducted anonymously.

A trader authentication module may authorize and or authenticate traders who log into the ETM in order to perform trading negotiations and or other functions. A transaction history module may record transactions performed by the ETM in the ETM database. The transaction history module also preferably records other data processed by the ETM including for example the orders received from and sent to the trading systems and the conducted negotiations.

A typical trading system at an investment management firm or other entity at which trading is performed includes a number of workstations coupled to an OMS server via a network with a trader at each workstation. Each workstation preferably executes a trader OMS interaction module TOIM for facilitating interactions between the trader s workstation and the OMS server. In one embodiment of the present invention the TOIM allows a trader to add delete or modify open or contemplated orders stored in the OMS database. The OMS which includes the OMS server OMS database and TOIM is typically provided by an OMS vendor though some firms have developed their own OMS s.

In connection with the present invention each workstation also preferably executes an ETM interaction module EIIVI for facilitating interactions with the ETM. The EIM allows a trader to send information to the ETM and view and respond to information received from the ETM. Typically this information includes information about the trader s indications information about other traders indications and orders transmitted to and received by a trader during a negotiation.

The OMS database holds data representative of open contemplated and or completed orders to buy and or sell securities by traders using the trading system. The OIM is in communication with the OMS database and the ETM. An OMS database integration module in the OIM may read data records stored in the OMS database and in a preferred embodiment also creates and modifies data records stored in the OMS database upon execution of a trade through the ETM. In one embodiment the OMS database interaction module directly accesses the OMS database and in another embodiment it sends commands to an application programming interface API in the OMS for accessing the database.

The OIM may include an ETM communication module for communicating with the ETM. In one embodiment the ETM communication module provides selected data records in the OMS database to the ETM and in a preferred embodiment receives data and or instructions from the ETM regarding changes to make to the OMS database. In addition the OIM preferably includes a data record conversion module for modifying the format of data records sent to the ETM and or received from the ETM. The OIM also preferably includes a filtering module for filtering out specified orders by security type security name order type order price order quantity or other category so that those orders are not transmitted to the ETM.

In some embodiments the OIM or some other component may include a reasoning module. Such a reasoning module may determine why a particular order is present in an OMS database e.g. by asking a trader entering the order by receiving such information from a trader by searching strategy information that also may be stored by an OMS by analyzing trading behavior by receiving information from a risk model associated with a trader etc. . In some embodiments the reasoning module may be used to suggest and or enter orders for securities that fulfill reasons for other orders being present. Such functionality may be useful if an order would otherwise go unfulfilled and a reasonable alternative security is available.

Preferably the OIM transmits to the ETM data records in the OMS database relating to a trader s orders when the trader logs on to the ETM. Once the OIM determines that the trader has logged on to the ETM the OIM retrieves data records about that trader s orders suitable for transmission to the ETM from the OMS database. In one embodiment the OIM converts the data records retrieved from the OMS database into a standardized format understood by the ETM. In another embodiment this functionality is part of the ETM.

After a trader has logged on to the ETM the OIM determines whether the contents of the OMS database have changed. If the OMS database has changed the OIM determines whether the change should be transmitted to the ETM. In one embodiment the OIM continues to determine whether the contents of the OMS database have changed between the time that a trader logs on to the ETM and the time that the ETM commences trading. In another embodiment the OIM does not commence making this determination until the time that the ETM commences trading.

Because typical OMS s are complex and multi featured and because securities of types not handled by the ETM may be traded using the OMS some changes to the OMS database do not necessitate a transmission of updated data to the ETM. The OIM preferably transmits changes to the database to the ETM if the changes represent new or modified orders.

The OIM preferably updates the database in response to information received from the ETM indicating executed trades or other information. In a preferred embodiment if an execution occurred in the ETM involving an order in the OMS associated with the OIM the OIM receives information from the ETM describing the execution. This information includes for example the type amount and price of securities traded the time of execution and or information identifying the original order in the OMS database on which the execution was based. The OIM converts the received information about the execution into the format used by the OMS and updates the OMS database accordingly. As a result of these steps the OMS is updated automatically and transparently to reflect executions performed at the ETM. The executions appear to the OMS as typical trades conducted at another broker so no special functionality needs to be added to the OMS in order to interact with the ETM beyond that functionality described herein.

Although several embodiments may be described as involving traders it should be recognized that other embodiments may not involve traders in all the same ways as described or at all. Rather than involving traders in negotiations entering of trades in an OMS and or other actions some embodiments may be automated through a trading algorithm. Such a trading algorithm may control the entry of traders the negotiation of deals and or any other actions that would traditionally be controlled by one or more traders at a trading institution.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 136 834 to Merrin hereinafter Merrin et al. is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including the specification of Merrin the prosecution file history of Merrin and any other material that provides meaning to any portion of the patent. Accordingly terms that have a meaning in Merrin e.g. based on the specification based on the prosecution file history based on other material that provides a meaning to the any portion of the patent etc. are intended to have the same meaning herein. Thus the person of ordinary skill in the art would understand terms used in Merrin and used herein to have the same meaning.

In some embodiments an ETM may be configured to couple to other ETMs and or other marketplaces. For example one particular ETM may be configured to facilitate trades between traders coupled to the particular ETM. That particular ETM may in some circumstances e.g. if no counter parties for a particular order is available at the particular ETM may transmit information about orders to another ETM to try to find counter parties through that other ETM. Accordingly one ETM may be able to avail itself of orders traders associated with other ETMs. Transmitting order information to other ETMs may be performed after asking a trader associated with a particular order if such transmission is acceptable and or according to a previously established trading preference of a particular trader. In some embodiments different ETMs may be configured to trade different things. For example one ETM may be configured to trade stocks and another ETM may be configured to trade derivatives. The coupling of such ETMs configured to trade different things may be particularly useful in embodiments configured to offer additional products and or services to traders based on knowledge regarding orders submitted by traders as discussed in more detail below.

The trading systems A B C are used by investment management firms or other entities that have established a relationship with the ETM . The trading systems communicate with the ETM to facilitate the trading of securities. As used herein a security is any ownership or creditorship interest such as a stock certificate or bond or any other financial instrument contract or transaction such as a forward futures option put call collar swap or currency contract. This definition includes for example any note stock bond debenture certificate of interest or participation in any profit sharing agreement or in any oil gas or other mineral royalty or lease any collateral trust certificate investment contract voting trust certificate certificate of deposit any put call straddle option or privilege on any of the foregoing or group or index of securities including any interest therein or based on the value thereof . This list is not all inclusive. For purposes of clarity this description will describe the trading of stock.

Within each trading system is a database A B C associated with an order management system OMS . Each OMS database holds data representative of open contemplated and or completed orders to buy and or sell securities collectively referred to herein as orders for securities by traders using the trading system . For example assume that the database A of trading system A contains orders to sell 50 000 shares of DELL and 75 000 shares of MSFT and orders to buy 25 000 shares of CPQ and 100 000 shares of IBM. Also assume that the database B of trading system B contains orders to sell 30 000 shares of CPQ and buy 62 000 shares of T.

The orders in the OMS databases may be automatically transmitted to the ETM . Likewise any changes in the orders such as modifications and or withdrawals may be automatically transmitted to the ETM . As used herein the term automatically means that the associated action is performed without any human or manual intervention. Thus there is no need for traders to specifically request that individual orders in the OMS databases are transmitted to the ETM orders in the databases are sent to the ETM without the traders input subject to filtering criteria .

In some embodiments orders in OMS databases may not be automatically transmitted to the ETM . Rather traders may individually select orders from an OMS database to be transmitted to the ETM . Because some trading firms may fear that information about some of the orders stored within their OMS databases may be used maliciously if that information is revealed using such selective transmission rather than automatic transmission may enable trading firms to keep particularly sensitive order information from being transmitted while allowing less sensitive order information to be transmitted.

Preferably the ETM anonymously transmits information about a trader s orders to other traders using the ETM subject to filtering in accordance with filtering criteria established by the traders and or the ETM. Moreover the ETM preferably manages anonymous negotiations between traders using the trading systems for the purpose of executing the orders and sends data about the completed trades to the OMS s of the traders involved in the transaction.

Thus one embodiment of the present invention selectively broadcasts information about the orders received by the ETM from the database A of trading system A to the other trading systems B C. Likewise the ETM selectively broadcasts information about the orders received from the database B of trading system B to the other trading systems A C. If the traders desire such a trade the ETM will facilitate the anonymous negotiation and sale of 25 000 shares of CPQ from a trader using trading system B to a trader using trading system A.

In some embodiments an order from a first trader may be narrowcast to potential counter parties. To determine which other traders are potential counter parties the ETM may match the order from the first trader with orders received from other traders e.g. by security name type order size price etc. . If matching orders are available from other traders those traders may be identified as potential counter parties and information about the order from the first trader may be transmitted to those traders.

Data may be communicated between the trading systems and the ETM using interfacing links A B C. Any known interfacing technologies can be used to effectuate these links including but not limited to transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP satellite cellular and or radio frequency RF links or some combination thereof. The links may pass through one or more intermediate data processing systems such as telephone switches or Internet servers before reaching the ETM or a trading system . In embodiments where data travels over shared links such as embodiments where data travels over the public Internet the data is preferably encrypted using a secure protocol such as the secure sockets layer SSL .

Data received by the ETM from the trading systems over the interfacing links may be received by a firewall . As is known in the art the firewall preferably prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to the rest of the ETM and monitors transfers of data to and from the network.

Data that pass through the firewall may be received by one or more modules that perform the functionality of the ETM . As used herein the term module refers to machine executable code and or data but may also include associated circuitry such as processing circuitry as well as data storage areas and or any other software or hardware. Thus it will be appreciated that one or a combination of hardware and software such as a computer system executing software for performing the functionality of the modules may implement each of the modules shown in . It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the ETM may comprise one or more other types of modules circuitry etc. not shown in in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring understanding of the invention. For instance the ETM may include one or more microprocessors network connection circuitry and or data storage areas such as read only memory ROM random access memory RAM CDROM DVD tape drive hard disk HD and or other types of storage areas. It will also be appreciated that the functionality of multiple modules described herein can be combined into a single module and the functionality of a single module can be split or shared among multiple modules. Moreover alternative embodiments of the present invention can lack one or more of the modules described herein and or have modules not described herein.

The ETM preferably includes an OMS data integration module ODIM . The ODIM receives and processes data representative of orders received from the OMS databases in the trading systems . In a preferred embodiment the data from the OMS databases are provided to the ETM in a standardized format that requires little processing by the ODIM . In an alternative embodiment the data from the OMS databases are provided to the ETM in one or more different formats depending upon factors such as the type of OMS used by the trading systems the types of interfacing links supplying the data to the ETM the type of security or orders to which the data pertains and the like. In this latter embodiment the ODIM preferably converts the data into a standardized format for use by other modules in the ETM .

The orders processed by the ODIM may be stored in an ETM database . Data in the database are preferably accessible to the other modules in the ETM . In addition the other modules in the ETM can store other data in the illustrated database or other databases as may be required during normal operation.

In a preferred embodiment an indications module transmits information about orders received by the ETM among the various traders based upon filtering criteria established by the traders and or the ETM. This information is transmitted among the traders in the form of non binding indications.

Based upon these indications traders may be able to enter into negotiations with other traders through a negotiation module . The negotiation module may facilitate negotiations between traders using trading systems and having contra interests. In one embodiment at least parts of the negotiations are conducted anonymously in order to limit the spread of information about the traders activities.

A market data module may receive real time and or other market data from an input . The market data module may provide the market data to the negotiation module and or to the traders. The traders preferably use the market data during the negotiations to determining market prices for the securities.

A transaction history module may record transactions performed by the ETM in the database . The transaction history module also preferably records other data processed by the ETM including for example information about orders received from and sent to the trading systems and the negotiations conducted successful or not . This module is preferably used to audit the transactions conducted on the ETM .

In some embodiments the transaction history module may record transaction information as well as information about orders that were placed but unfulfilled. Such information may be used to provide products and or services to traders. For example information about a frequency of orders placed for a particular security may be recorded and used to inform traders about how liquid a market for the security has been historically and or how long an order may take to be fulfilled based on historic trades. As another example information about fulfilled transactions for a particular trader may be used to provide information about other goods or services that the trader may desire such as hedging opportunities related to the trades e.g. available futures trades on a same or different ETM that may be used to hedge an equity purchase etc. . As yet another example some embodiments may use recorded information to determine that major changes in a trading pattern of a security e.g. a major price drop a major change in liquidity etc. has occurred and use such information to adjust performance e.g. prepare for a major increase in trading activity offload orders to a different market pause acceptance of orders temporarily until trading has stabilized etc. trade on a security e.g. for an account fund associated with an ETM operator and or provide such information to traders.

A trader authentication module may authorize and or authenticate traders who log into the ETM in order to perform trading negotiations and or other functions. In one embodiment the trader authentication module stores authentication information such as a login ID password pair in the database . The trader authentication module also preferably stores profiles for the registered traders.

Other modules that may be present in the ETM include load monitoring modules for monitoring the load on various servers comprising the ETM fault tolerance modules for providing fault tolerance to the ETM security modules for preventing and detecting security violations on the ETM and back office modules for providing back office functionality. These modules are not shown in in order to avoid unnecessarily complicating the figure.

In a typical trading system that interacts with the ETM each workstation executes a trader OMS interaction module TOIM for facilitating interactions with the OMS server . In this typical trading system the TOIM allows a trader to add delete or modify open or contemplated orders stored in the OMS database . Contemplated orders may be stored in the OMS database for example because the trader intends to execute certain transactions in stages or because the contemplated transactions are desirable only if the market prices of the securities to be traded are within a certain range e.g. limit orders . Therefore such orders serve as placeholders indicating the total quantity of a security that a trader wishes to transact and conditions for transacting other orders other data in the database indicate the quantity of the security that has been transacted to date.

Each workstation may execute an ETM interaction module EIM for facilitating interactions with the ETM . In alternative embodiments of the present invention the EIM is incorporated into the TOIM or other modules on the workstation . The EIM allows a trader to send information to the ETM and view and respond to information received from the ETM . Typically the received information includes information about orders through the indications module and orders through the negotiation module that the ETM receives from other traders or trading institutions. The trader uses the EIM to enter into and transact negotiations to buy and or sell securities through the ETM .

The network connects the workstations to the OMS and to external networks such as the network in communication with the ETM . The network can utilize any networking technology that supports bi directional transfer of data among the OMS workstations and external networks. In a typical embodiment the network is a private local area network LAN installed at a financial institution and interfacing with one or more external gateways. In alternate embodiments the network may be wireless connect devices over a wide area and or at least partially carry data over a public network such as the Internet . Other network components such as a firewall may also be present. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different types of networks can perform the functionality described herein.

The OMS is preferably comprised of one or more computer systems for executing and maintaining an order management system. The OMS receives instructions from the workstations to create modify and or delete orders and updates the database accordingly. Software providing the functionality of the OMS is well known in the art. Commercial OMS software packages are available from The MacGregor Group Eze Castle Software Advent Software and Decalog to name but a few. In addition some trading institutions utilize custom OMS software.

As described above the database may hold data representative of open contemplated and or completed orders to buy and or sell securities. is a diagram illustrating a data record stored in the database to identify an order according to one embodiment of the present invention. Different OMS systems utilize different order data records and therefore it should be understood that illustrates only one possible data record. However many OMS systems store the same general information and the illustrated order data record is intended to represent a typical order data record for an OMS system.

The order data record has multiple fields each field holding different information about an order. The Order ID field preferably holds a value uniquely identifying the order associated with the data record . Similarly the Trader ID field preferably holds a value uniquely identifying the trader or other person who placed the order. The Order Status field identifies whether the order is open contemplated completed canceled or any other possible status. The next field Order Last Update Time preferably holds a timestamp that identifies the last time that the data record was modified in any way. This field is useful for determining whether the most recent version of the data record has been considered.

The Transaction Type field preferably indicates whether the data record corresponds to an order to buy or sell a security. The Security Symbol field preferably uniquely identifies the security to be transacted. The Security Symbol field can hold for example a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures CUSIP number a ticker symbol or any other identifier of the security. The Security Type field is preferably used to interpret the other data in the data record according to the given security type. For example treasury bills are priced in terms of a discount to face value inherent in the pricing formula is the yield that would be obtained if the bill were held to maturity. In contrast equity securities are priced in actual per share values. The information in the Security Type field can also be used to filter out certain types of securities.

The Order Type field preferably indicates whether the order is a market or a limit order although the field can also indicate other order types. If the order is a limit order the Limit Price Field preferably identifies the price set by the trader.

The Total Order Size field preferably identifies the actual number of shares that the trader desires to transact. The Quantity Placed Elsewhere field is a value either equal to or less than the value in the Total Order Size field . In an embodiment of the present invention the ETM uses the values of these two fields to determine a quantity of a security if any that are available to be transacted by the ETM.

Preferably the OMS allows for the possibility that trading a large quantity of a given security may occur over several days at several different venues. For example to fill an order to buy 1 000 000 shares of IBM a trader may need to place an order for 300 000 shares with one broker and record numerous executions of portions thereof until the full 300 000 shares placed with that broker are purchased. If the broker cannot provide additional shares at a suitable price the trader may then place an additional quantity up to the 700 000 shares remaining to be purchased via another broker electronic marketplace or other venue. Preferably the broker enters a placement record into the OMS database to indicate that the trader anticipates executing a portion of the order through the second venue. This second venue may also fill the quantity it was asked to provide in several executions. Thus an order can have one or more placements and each placement can have one or more executions associated with it.

When a transaction is executed in a specified venue such as the ETM a corresponding execution record is preferably stored in the OMS database . is a diagram illustrating an execution record according to an embodiment of the present invention. An execution ID field preferably holds a value identifying the particular execution. As before the Order ID field preferably holds a value that uniquely identifies the order associated with the execution and all executions for the same order preferably have the same value in this field . The Broker field preferably contains an alphanumeric value identifying the venue that performed the execution. The Quantity Executed field preferably specifies the number of securities transacted in this execution while the Price field specifies the price at which the securities were executed. The Timestamp field preferably records the time at which the execution took place.

The OMS interfacing module OIM may be in communication with the OMS database via the network or a direct connection. In alternative embodiments the OIM is in communication with the OMS and or the workstations . The OIM may also be in communication with the ETM via an external gateway or some other form of network connection. In another alternative embodiment the OIM is integrated into the ETM and is remote from the OMS although some functionality is present at the OMS in order to provide OMS data to the OIM.

In a preferred embodiment the OIM includes a computer system storing and executing software for performing the functionality described herein. In an alternative embodiment the OIM executes on the same computer system as the OMS . In one embodiment the OIM includes an OMS database interaction module for interacting with the OMS database . The OMS database interaction module reads records stored in the OMS database and in a preferred embodiment creates and modifies data records stored in the OMS database . In one embodiment the OMS database interaction module directly accesses the OMS database and in another embodiment it sends commands to an applications programming interface API in the OMS for accessing the database.

The OIM also preferably includes an ETM communication module for communicating with the ETM . In one embodiment the ETM communication module automatically provides selected data records in the OMS database to the ETM and in a preferred embodiment receives data and or instructions from the ETM. In addition the OIM also preferably includes a data record conversion module for modifying the format of the data records sent to and or received from the ETM and a filtering module for filtering out specified orders by security type security name order type order quantity order price or some other factor or category so that filtered orders are not transmitted to the ETM.

Preferably the OIM waits until a trader logs on to the OMS before transmitting data records for that trader to the ETM . In one embodiment the ETM sends a message to the OIM when a trader at the institution in which the OIM resides logs into the ETM. The OIM interprets this message as a sign to commence receiving orders. In other embodiments of the present invention the OIM uses other techniques such as querying the OMS database for specific entries listening for an inter process message sent by the OMS polling individual trader workstations or implementing a timer based algorithm to determine that a trader has logged on to the OMS .

Once a determination is made that a trader has logged on to the OMS the OIM may retrieve data records about orders suitable for transmission to the ETM from the OMS database . In one embodiment of the present invention all open orders are suitable for transmission to the ETM . In other embodiments of the present invention the OIM through the filtering module makes the determination of suitable orders based on other criteria such as the security type e.g. stock or bond security name e.g. IBM or T order type e.g. market or limit order order quantity and or order price. In still other embodiments only orders selected by a trading firm e.g. by the trader associated with the OMS may be suitable for transmission.

If necessary the data record conversion module within the OIM preferably converts the data records retrieved from the OMS database into a standardized format understood by the ETM . As described above the functionality of the data record conversion module can also be performed by the ODIM in the ETM . Alternative embodiments of the present invention may send the data records individually or in multiple batches. The data transmitted to the ETM depend on factors such as the types of securities being traded and or the fields required in order to accurately trade such securities.

If the database has changed the OIM preferably determines whether the change should be transmitted to the ETM . Because typical OMS s are complex and multi featured and because securities of types not handled by the ETM may be traded using the OMS some changes to the OMS database may not necessitate a transmission of updated data to the ETM . Thus the OIM may determine whether the change to the database reflects a new order of a type that is traded in the ETM and in some embodiments other ETMs and or marketplaces coupled to the ETM . If so then the OIM may retrieve the pertinent data for the order from the database . If the change does not reflect a new order then the OIM preferably determines whether the database change pertains to a modification of an existing order that has already been sent to the ETM . If so the OIM may retrieve the data records corresponding to the modified order from the database . Once the appropriate data records if any are retrieved from the database the OIM preferably converts the data records into the appropriate format and transmits the records to the ETM as described above with respect to .

The OIM initially may determine whether an execution occurred in the ETM involving an order in the OMS associated with the OIM. The step may be performed for example by receiving a message from the ETM identifying a particular execution that occurred at the ETM by filtering a list of all executions or other data from the ETM for executions listed in the OMS or by periodically polling the ETM for performed executions.

If an execution occurred in the ETM involving an order in the OMS associated with the OIM the OIM receives information from the ETM describing the execution. This information includes for example the type amount and price of securities traded the time of execution and or information identifying the original order in the OMS database on which the execution was based. The OIM may convert the received information about the execution into the format used by the OMS . Then the OIM may update the OMS database with the converted execution data. As a result of these steps the OMS may be updated automatically and transparently to reflect executions performed at the ETM . The executions appear to the OMS as typical trades conducted at another broker.

In some embodiments information about orders in an OMS database and or any other information about a trading institution may be used to provide additional e.g. complimentary alternative products and or services to traders. The information about the orders may include the existence of the orders the existence of counter orders the lack of counter orders historical data about similar orders historical data about counter orders knowledge that an order was unfulfilled e.g. for some time period was removed from the system in an unfulfilled state etc. knowledge about a broader trading plan that may be embodied by specific orders e.g. knowledge that a particular order is present because of a desire to trade in a particular industry market capitalization etc. knowledge that an order was fulfilled knowledge that an order is now inactive e.g. was fulfilled expired was unfulfilled etc. information about a risk model and or any other information. In some embodiments such features may be available to premium users of an ETM e.g. users willing to pay a fee . The additional products and or service may be available through a single ETM and or additional ETMs.

In some embodiments an ETM OIM OMS and or other component may track e.g. determine when an order becomes inactive and store information about it unfulfilled orders e.g. expired orders and or orders that were removed e.g. removed from an OMS removed from consideration by the ETM etc. . The knowledge that an order was once placed and was not fulfilled may reveal that a trader associated with the order may desire a trade in a security associated with the order in the future. When new orders are received there may be no available counter parties currently trading in a security identified by the order. The existence of counter parties may be determined by searching e.g. through a listing maintained in a database of the ETM for matching offers received from a plurality of other traders using an ETM. In some implementations if no such parties are available unfulfilled orders may be used to find such parties. Such use of unfulfilled orders may occur after a new order has been active e.g. near an expiration time of the order after an indication that the order is being otherwise removed from the system is received etc. .

The use of such unfulfilled orders may include querying a party associated with the unfilled order or any other inactive order . Such query may ask if the party is still interested in a trade related to the security and or identify that a matching counter order is now available. The party may then reenter an order enter into negotiations with the party associated with the new order ignore the request and or take any other desired actions.

In some embodiments before such unfulfilled orders are used a party associated with the new order may be asked if such use is desired. To encourage the use of such orders for matching the party associated with the new order may be provided with statistics related to the usefulness of such orders. The statistics may be gathered by a transactional history module of an ETM and may include for example a percentage of times when such orders have successfully fulfilled an order and or any other desired information. The information may be selected at a degree of abstraction that is most convincing e.g. overall securities securities in a related industry a specific security a specific counter party etc. .

In some embodiments in which multiple unfulfilled orders exist priority may be given according to any desired priority mechanism. For example possible counter parties associated with larger orders may be queried first possible counter parties associated with most recently expired orders may be queried first etc.

In some embodiments counter party identities may be kept anonymous during part or all of a querying process associated with the use of unfulfilled orders. Also size of orders and or any other information related to new and or inactive unfulfilled orders may be kept confidential during the process until the counterparties choose to reveal such information.

Any number of unfulfilled orders may be tracked for any desired time period. For example in some embodiments some number of the most recently expired orders may be tracked. In some embodiments all unfulfilled orders may be tracked for some desired period. In some embodiments the tracking may relate to characteristics of the security. For example orders associated with a less liquid security may be tracked for a longer time than orders associated with a more liquid security.

Fulfilled orders may be tracked for use in fulfilling future orders in a substantially similar method to tracking unfulfilled orders described above. This may be useful because a trader that has previously traded in a security may be more likely to trade in that security again. The fulfilled orders may be fulfilled through the ETM and or through some other method e.g. a different marketplace .

In some embodiments if it is determined that no matching counter parties e.g. counter parties with orders matching the order in their OMS s are available e.g. a counter party is not found for an order e.g. after some time period near an expiration time for an order etc. alternative products and or services may be offered to a trader. The alternative products and or services may be based at least in part on a characteristic of an order entered by the trader. The desired characteristics may include for example market capitalization geographic area industry risk level profit to loss ratio volume of trades profit level sales level cash on hand amount analyst recommendation and or any other information. For example derivatives based on the security may be offered e.g. from other orders available to the ETM from another market etc. other securities may be offered e.g. securities with similar profiles such as capitalization industry etc. securities that were purchased by other traders who also placed similar orders e.g. after a similar order went unfulfilled securities that fulfill a desire associated with the order e.g. a desire to adjust a portfolio to include a particular industry etc. . In some embodiments information about how long an order may take to be fulfilled based on historical trading trends may be provided. Such information may encourage a trader to take an alternative to the order if the time is too long or wait for order fulfillment if the time is short.

In some embodiments an alternative product and or service may include a trade that is based on a reason for the order in the trader s OMS database. For example an ETM may receive information about the reason that the order is present in the OMS e.g. a desire to own a security in a particular industry and based on that reason may determine that an alternative available order may fulfill the same reason and offer that order as an alternative. In some embodiments a reason may be part of a broader trading strategy and or risk model that may be shared with the ETM so that the ETM may offer alternatives that more closely fulfill reasons embodied by the order and that fits into the broader trading strategy and or risk model.

In some embodiments if a matching order is found for an order additional e.g. complementary products and or services may be offered. For example the fact that an order has been at least partly fulfilled may be determined and in response an additional product and or service may be offered. The order may be fulfilled through the ETM and or through some other method and identified as fulfilled to the ETM e.g. through a status change in an OMS . The product and or service may be offered from a marketplace operator a participant of a marketplace and or any other source. For example a trader may be offered a hedging opportunity after an order for a security is fulfilled. Such a hedging opportunity may include a future related to the security. The hedging opportunity may be available through a different counter party on the same ETM e.g. may be found in similar fashion to finding an original counter party and or through another marketplace.

In some embodiments historical data about previous orders may be used to recommend additional products and or services. For example if a trader has a trade go unfulfilled the trader may be presented with an available order that was often entered by traders that also had similar orders go unfulfilled.

In some embodiments historical information may be used to adjust treatment of new orders. For example if an order is entered for a historically illiquid security additional avenues may be used to find a matching order such as prior traders who had entered orders for the security other marketplaces etc. In some embodiments other traders may be information of the existence of an order for an illiquid security. Traders may be encouraged to enter counter orders for illiquid securities through any desired incentivizing method. For example traders may be offered priority in liquid orders if they enter an order for an illiquid security traders may be offered rebates for entering such orders and or traders may be offered any desired incentive for entering such orders.

In various embodiments trades may be related to any desired currency or country e.g. stocks of U.S. companies stocks of Chinese companies British savings bonds etc. . In some embodiments a trader in one country may enter into a trade involving another country and or the currency of another country e.g. a U.S. trader may purchase debt of a Japanese company .

In some such embodiments additional products or services may be offered based on the knowledge of a currency associated with a trade. For example one or more currency trade contracts may be offered to a trader involved in such trading. A currency trade contract may act as a hedging instrument against volatility in currency markets. Such a contract may allow a trader to exchange the contract for some cash value if the currency associated with the trade changes in value compared to the trader s native currency. In some embodiments the availability of such contracts may be included as a negotiation option between traders when negotiating a trade. In some embodiments traders may trade in such contracts among each other independently of any other trade e.g. through the ETM and or some other marketplace . In some embodiments a trader may be offered such a contract as a service from a marketplace e.g. the operator of the ETM may offer such contracts for a fee as a service to users of the ETM .

Some embodiments may include participants from different time zones. Such participants may not always be active at the same time due in part to the differences in the time zones. Accordingly one or more mechanisms may be used to address these time zone differences.

For example in some embodiments participants may be able to establish automatic trading profiles that can be used to automatically negotiate accept and or reject trades during times when the participants are not active e.g. at night on holidays etc. . Such profiles for example may indicate that orders for securities in a certain price range should always be accepted and or any other desired actions should be taken.

In some embodiments active trading times may be tied to a particular market e.g. the New York Stock Exchange . By limiting trading to hours similar to a particular market participants may be sure that they can participate in trades by being present during that period of time.

In some embodiments a marketplace e.g. the ETM may determine if a participant is active and involve active participants in potential trades with some level of preference. Such determining may include monitoring a level of activity at a computer terminal presenting a query through a computer interface and or any other desired action. In some embodiments if a participant is not active e.g. has gone home for the day the participant may not be eligible to be part of a trade until the participant becomes active again. In other embodiments active participants may be given preference over inactive participants but inactive participants may still be offered an opportunity to be involved in trades.

In some embodiments if a matching order involves an active trader and an inactive trader a negotiation may be started between the two traders. The active trader may be informed that the inactive trader is inactive. The active trader may be given an estimate of when the inactive trader may be active e.g. an indication of a time zone difference historic data etc. . While waiting for the inactive trader to become active to enter into a negotiation the order associated with the active trader may still be used to search for other matches e.g. with other active traders . When the inactive trader returns to active status the previously inactive trader may enter into a negotiation about the trade with the previously active trader. The previously active trader may have gone inactive by the time the previously inactive trader becomes active. Because such a problems may occur due to time difference a negotiation may take a long time to complete. In some embodiments one or more sides of the negotiation may enter information to automate the negotiation e.g. preferences limit prices etc. so that the negotiation may complete in a shorter time.

Some embodiments may be limited to buy side trading participants i.e. investing institutions that tend to buy large portions of securities for money management purposes . Other embodiments may include buy side participants and sell side participants e.g. brokers retail analysts etc. . Buy side participants are typically protective of revealing trading intentions because of a fear of malicious market manipulation and a fear of revealing proprietary trading strategies. Some embodiments which allow sell side participation may include mechanisms to address such fears of buy side participants.

For example in some embodiments buy side participants may be able to opt out of trading with sell side participants. In some embodiments buy side participants may be able to establish filters that allow only some sell side participant orders to be traded with the buy side participants. For example filters may allow sell side participant orders for a sufficient amount of a security if the sell side agrees to a non negotiated fulfillment of the order e.g. according to a standard price such as the most recent traded price etc. and or if the sell side and or the sell side participant s order meets any other desired criteria of the buy side participant.

In some embodiments indications of one or more criteria for use in filtering orders may be received. The criteria may be used to establish appropriate filters so that orders not meeting the criteria are filtered. If orders do meet the criteria the orders may be presented to the market participant that established the criteria. In some embodiments the criteria may include a time related criteria e.g. when the order is received when the order may be presented to the market participant e.g. orders for XXX security may only be presented between noon and 2 pm etc. etc. . In some embodiments the criteria may include quantity related criteria an identification criteria a price related criteria a type related criteria an industry related criteria and or any other criteria.

Some embodiments may limit options available to sell side participants. For example sell side participants may only be able to enter binding orders. If a sell side participant s order finds a counter party in a buy side participant the sell side participant may be bound to fulfill the order. In some embodiments even though a sell side participant is bound to fulfill an order a negotiation for price and or quantity may still occur between a buy side participant and a sell side participant. In other embodiments no negotiation may be started but rather a trade may be facilitated without a negotiation e.g. if the buy side accepts the offer the trade may occur automatically according to a standard pricing mechanism for a quantity of securities identified in the sell side order etc. .

In some embodiments a request for acceptance of an order may be transmitted to one or more market participants e.g. buy side participants . In some embodiments such participants may receive the requests for acceptance of an order. In some embodiments the market participants may be allowed to respond to the request for acceptance within a limited amount of time. If the participant responds affirmatively to the request for acceptance within the limited time then an indication of acceptance may be transmitted and or an execution of a trade fulfilling at least a portion of an order may be facilitated.

In some embodiments a sell side participant may be required to enter a quantity of a security to be traded when entering an order. A sell side participant may be bound to that quantity if an order from a buy side participant matches the sell side order. In some embodiments the sell side participant may negotiate to increase the quantity but may be limited to the quantity as a minimum. In some embodiments a sell side participant may only enter orders above a threshold minimum quantity.

In some embodiments to avoid negotiations between sell side and buy side participants sell side participants may be bound to have their orders fulfilled according to a standard pricing mechanism. Such a pricing mechanism may include fulfilling the order based on a well known midpoint pricing policy and or any other desired mechanism.

In some embodiments when two sell side participants become counter parties to a trade they may not be restricted in the same manner as when a sell side participant is a counter party to a buy side participant. For example if two sell side participants enter a negotiation both may enter negotiations for price and or quantity even if such negotiations are limited or not allowed at all when a sell side participant and a buy side participant are counter parties.

In some embodiments parties with matching orders may enter into a limited negotiation. For example execution of a trade fulfilling matching orders may include a negotiation that does not include a negotiation about price and or a negotiation about quantity. A price for example may be determined using a VWAP midpoint and or any other desired pricing policy. A quantity may be determined based on quantities defined by the matching orders. If there are any other issues to be negotiated some embodiments may allow a negotiation for those issues e.g. time of execution platform to use for execution etc. .

In some embodiments evidence of actions things may be suppressed from one or more parties. For example in some embodiments when a determination is made that one order matches another order any evidence of that determination may be suppressed from one or more parties associated with the orders and or any other parties when a criteria for a filter is established any evidence of the criteria and or the establishment of the filter may be suppressed when a determination about whether an order meets criteria of a filter is made evidence of that determination may be suppressed. Such suppression of evidence may occur until some action occurs and or for some amount of time. For example in one implementation evidence that a first party s order matches a second party s order may be suppressed from the first party until and unless the second party decides to proceed with the order and or until the execution of the order is facilitated.

In some embodiments suppressing evidence of an event may include performing any action or not performing any action so that an observer is led to believe that the event did not occur. For example suppressing evidence may include performing one or more actions that would occur if the event did not occur e.g. transmitting requests transmitting indications that the event did not occur etc. transmitting misleading information regarding the event e.g. transmitting indications that the event did not occur transmitting indications that another event occurred transmitting information before the event and or after the event that obscure the occurrence of the event e.g. indications that the event happened earlier and or later so that the actually occurrence of the vent is obscured not transmitting information that the event occurred transmitting imitations information to mislead observers encrypting information transmissions using onion routing techniques obscuring a source of transmissions obscuring a destination of transmissions obscuring the timing of events and or any other actions.

In some embodiments an order may include an order to purchase or sell a quantity of a financial instrument. The side of the order may refer to whether the order is for a purchase or a sale of a financial instrument. Two orders may match if the orders are for the same financial instrument and are for opposite side of a trade for that financial instrument. Other criteria such as quantity price etc. may also be sued to determine if orders match each other.

In some implementations an order may indicate a price range in which a execution of a trade fulfilling at least part of the order is agreed. In such implementations a first order may match a second order if the two orders are for opposite sides of a trade for a single financial instrument and the two orders have at least partially overlapping price ranges. In some implementations an actual price of a trade may be determined according to a VWAP and or midpoint pricing model.

In some embodiments facilitating execution of a trade may include taking any actions which help to bring about the execution of a trade. In some implementations facilitating execution may include for example executing the trade beginning a negotiation between the first market participant and the second market participant that does not involve the price of the trade and does not involve the quantity of financial instruments in the trade transmitting information about the trade to a third party to execute the trade and or any other actions. Such actions may include centralized actions and or distributed actions.

In some embodiments one or more market participants may be charged a fee for use of a trading system. For example if matching orders are found and or facilitation of order execution is performed a fee may be charged to the parties related to the matching orders. In some embodiments some parties may be incentivized to use a trading system by providing a financial incentive regarding such fees. For example in some embodiments some participants may not be charged a fee orders meeting certain criteria may not be charged a fee some participants may be given a payment to submit orders and so on. Such incentivizing may help to increase liquidity in a market where certain participants may be otherwise unwilling to provide such liquidity.

In some implementations for example a portion of a fee charged to a first participant may be provided to a second participant. In some implementations providing the portion of the fee to the second participant may include paying at least part of a second fee for the second participant e.g. discounting the fee of the second participant by the portion . In some implementations providing the portion may include crediting an account of the second participant e.g. providing a payment to a financial account . In some implementations buy side participants may be given a discount and or a payment for use and sell side participants may be charged a fee. The fee charged to sell side participants may be sued to pay the discount or payment given to buy side participants. In some implementations when two buy side participants interact no discount no fee and or no payment may be made to either party. In some implementations the first party to submit an order may be given a discount and or payment.

In some embodiments various actions taken by traders and or information presented to traders may be taken presented through one or more user interfaces of computing devices. For example indications of orders negotiations etc. may be facilitated by user interfaces through which traders may interact. Traders may enter order information accept order requests establish criteria for filters etc. through suitable user interfaces of computing devices. In other embodiments such user interfaces may not be used and or needed to perform all of some of such actions e.g. computers may perform such actions without user interfaces etc. .

In summary the present invention includes an electronic trading marketplace that generates liquidity at least in part by receiving order information directly from the databases of OMS systems at trading institutions. Since orders are extracted from the OMS databases automatically and information about executed orders is inserted into the databases automatically the OMS databases see the marketplace as just another market intermediary. Moreover traders are able to conduct trades in the electronic marketplace without any duplicative manual efforts. The above description is included to illustrate the operation of the preferred embodiments and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims.

The subject invention relates to a method for managing certified trading information to direct and execute confidential trading interests over a computer network such as the Internet.

The term trading interest is used herein to describe any expressed interest in trading a given security or securities and the term certified trading interest is used herein to describe a trading interest that has been verified as genuine and certified as such by some trusted third party. One example of a genuine trading interest is an order that has been placed on a securities market automatic matching system. A second example of a genuine trading interest is a trading interest expressed by a party with a documented history of aggressive trading. An example of a trading interest that would not be certified is an undocumented indication of interest known in the art as an IOI .

In public securities markets market mechanics and trading psychology create barriers to efficient information dissemination and price discovery. A market participant s decision to reveal information regarding a large trading interest typically represents a tradeoff between confidentiality and liquidity. By publicly revealing the details of a significant active buying interest for example a market participant assumes the risk of adverse price action. Other market participants with legitimate selling interests and market makers can fade their offers become much less aggressive sellers . There is also an empirically demonstrable risk of adverse price action due to front running buying activity by market participants in anticipation of price movement resulting from the large revealed order . Confidentiality can be maintained by splitting the large order up into many small orders to avoid arousing interest but this is inefficient and will fail to attract substantial natural contra interests. An economically efficient transaction is therefore avoided because the trading costs associated with disseminating information are too high. Also the common practice of splitting large interests into smaller orders affects all price discovery. When confronting each order a market participant must incorporate the possibility that the order is only a small part of a much larger interest because it is often impossible for the market participant to verify that many such orders are not being sent simultaneously.

Another serious obstacle to efficient dissemination of trading interests and price discovery is the lack of validated information about trading interests. The validated trading interest information which does exist e.g. displayed executable orders is often of little assistance. Displayed orders are miniscule compared to undisclosed interest and typically equate to no more than one or two minutes of trading in a liquid stock in the U.S. market. Displayed orders can therefore be easily manipulated for example to indicate excess buying interest when sellers are in fact abundant. In addition non validated misinformation is often created and disseminated by unscrupulous market participants to manipulate market prices. Voluntarily disseminated trading interests can be false or misleading if they are not verified either by proof of a current executable order actual trades executed or canceled orders which were at one point executable at risk in the market. Because there is often no way for a market participant to verify an expressed trading interest or to know which other market participants have a history of unscrupulous trading behavior all prices must incorporate the possibility of such behavior.

One known approach to voluntary selective dissemination of non validated trading interests and activity in public equity markets is used by the AutEx system. This is an electronic database and online network that provides users with the ability to voluntarily publicly indicate trading interests and executed trades. AutEx users can limit the recipients of a message regarding a trading interest by inclusion a user defined list or exclusion blocking specific named market participants . Users can also limit by name the securities on which they receive information and the other users from whom they receive information.

In the AutEx system the expressed trading interests and reported trades are not certified however and this creates the opportunity for deceptive dissemination. In addition users of the system are not obligated to report all trades which offers further opportunities to create false impressions of trading interests. Significantly this approach does not enable the use of analysis of certified trading interests CTI to limit information dissemination to those market participants likely to have a contra interest. It also does not enable using such CTI analysis to permit market participants to limit the trading interest indications received. It also does not provide the ability to initiate an auction based on disseminated CTI analysis information. It also does not enable the monitoring of user trading activity to generate a rating of the accuracy of disclosures or the correlation of trading activity to inappropriate trading practices.

One known approach to matching trading interests and executing trades while limiting information dissemination is employed by the POSIT matching system. The POSIT system allows trading interests to accumulate and initiates a matching sequence at set intervals. Market participants place confidential orders in the system and are unaware of the amount or aggressiveness of other orders on the same or contra side until the matching is released. This approach does not enable targeted communication of trading interests based on analysis of verified executable interests and trading activity and does not provide the ability to initiate private auctions based on this analysis. It also does not enable granting the auction initiator any exclusivity over contra orders entered in response to the targeted dissemination.

In this environment there is an acute need for efficient dissemination of confidential information regarding trading interests. Market participants with large confidential trading interests wish to notify only those other market participants likely to have a significant contra interest. Other market participants wish to be notified of confidential certified trading interests to which they are likely to have a contra interest. Both groups wish to have a place to transact a trade once they have been connected through analysis of their certified trading interests. Market participants also desire certified information regarding the trading behavior of other market participants and a means of certifying expressed trading information.

Preferred embodiments of the subject invention overcome the limitations of known trading interest dissemination and execution systems by 1 enabling market participants to limit dissemination of trading interests to only those other market participants likely to have a significant contra interest 2 enabling market participants to ensure that other market participants disseminated trading interests are legitimate and 3 enabling auctions among trading interests targeted and validated in this manner. Software of a preferred embodiment identifies likely contra interests by analyzing information from various sources regarding certified trading interests.

A preferred embodiment comprises a method of managing market information comprising the steps of electronically receiving data including confidential information regarding market participants electronically storing said received data regarding market participants electronically receiving information from a first market participant computer electronically storing said information received from said first market participant computer producing a targeted dissemination list of market participants based on said stored data regarding market participants and said information received from said first market participant computer and electronically transmitting to the market participants on said targeted dissemination list data based on said information received from said first market participant computer.

Advantageously this is done without revealing the confidential information of the market participants to the first market participant. In one embodiment the identity of the first market participant is not revealed to the other participants.

External data sources provide information regarding positions held trades executed and active orders for the users . This enables the CTI manager to identify and verify users historical and current trading interests. In an alternate embodiment the CTI manager does not receive external data but only uses data generated within the system. In a preferred embodiment applied to the U.S. equity market the external data sources include various electronic communication networks ECNs such as Instinet public markets such as NASDAQTM stock exchanges matching networks such as POSIT and publicly available data such as the published holdings of various institutional investors. In a preferred embodiment the data regarding market participants used by the CTI manager comprises confidential information. For example the identity of an executable order on an ECN is not typically available. Since the confidential information is not publicly available the CTI system must obtain permission from the users to utilize it. In the preferred embodiment users agree to release this confidential information to the CTI system with the understanding that the secure CTI system will use the information only for supplying the user with valuable confidential trading interests of others. In other words the confidential information with which users entrust the CTI manager gives them access to more information in particular certified trading interests but the confidential information provided by users does not leak out to third parties.

In a preferred embodiment the CTI manager communicates in real time with external data sources via the Internet. Alternate embodiments employ dedicated communication networks as is well known in the art. Also alternate embodiments store information from external data sources in a database and update the information periodically rather than in real time. For example an alternate embodiment receives information regarding the published holdings of various institutional investors stores the information in a database and updates the information from the news service source only as frequently as new information is published. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art the subject invention could also be used to direct confidential information in markets other than U.S. equities since virtually all markets for fungible items of value pose the same informational inefficiencies.

In a preferred embodiment the CTI user database contains user data such as security and contact information CTI notification parameters and an activity history. The preferred embodiment maintains an activity history for each user that includes auctions initiated and their outcome e.g. whether the auction was canceled unsuccessful in locating a contra interest or resulted in a partial or full execution of the initiating interest . The activity history also includes the CTI notifications received the orders placed in response and their outcome whether the responding order was canceled unsuccessful or resulted in a partial or full execution of the response order . In an alternate preferred embodiment the CTI user database simply maintains overall statistics regarding this activity history for each user.

The CTI notification parameters specify the circumstances in which CTI information is to be received and can be different for different securities and different users. For example some users may limit CTI notifications to initiating interests over 100 000 shares for certain securities and 500 000 shares for others. In a preferred embodiment the notification parameters can be modified by the user at any time and can be on the basis of order size security identity of initiating user or statistics regarding the initiating user s activity history.

In an alternate preferred embodiment the CTI user database also contains information regarding inappropriate trading behavior such as peg gaming and front running. Peg gaming is possible when an auction sets the execution price to be the market midpoint at a specific time. An auction participant with a large buy order might sell actively in the market to pull the midpoint price down. Front running is possible in this context if for example a recipient of a notification of a large buy order starts buying CTI trades actively before the auction in anticipation of price action caused by the large CTI. The CTI manager of this embodiment will monitor the trading activity of all auction participants and note any suspected peg gaming or front running in the CTI user database either as raw data or as a rating of trading behavior. An alternate embodiment maintains similar data and or ratings in the CTI user database regarding the accuracy of the market participants non certified disclosures on external systems such as AutEx . A further embodiment maintains similar data and or ratings in the CTI user database regarding the market participants adherence to self imposed trading limits set during negotiations. This list is not intended to be exhaustive other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The auction server manages the process of accumulating market participant MP contra orders in response to a CTI notification and executing a matching auction. In an alternate embodiment there is no auction server and the CTI system functions as a targeted information dissemination mechanism. depicts the information management function of a preferred embodiment of the subject invention. An initiating user communicates to the CTI manager a trading interest and parameters that limit the dissemination of the information. The CTI manager uses these parameters and CTI information to determine which market participants should receive the information. Also each MP communicates his own parameters to the CTI manager delineating the trading interest information that the MP desires to receive. The CTI manager therefore acts as a bilateral CTI information filter . It limits dissemination of the initiating user s confidential information to those MPs for which 1 the MP fits the initiating user s dissemination parameters and 2 the initiating interest fits the MP s notification parameters. In an alternate embodiment the CTI manager is only a unilateral information filter in which the system targets MPs to notify but does not allow the MP to similarly filter notifications. Comparing and in a preferred embodiment both the initiating user and the market participants are users of the system the bilateral CTI information filter is the CTI manager and the CTI information is supplied by the external data sources and the CTI user database.

In a preferred embodiment the initiating interest includes a price limit which can be a nominal value e.g. 1121 2 or pegged to a market price when the price is set e.g. market midpoint set at the termination of the auction . Alternate embodiments enable the initiating user to peg the price limit to a yet to be determined market value or index. For example in an alternate embodiment the user can peg the price limit to the daily volume weighted average price VWAP as will be calculated at the end of the trading session. In the preferred embodiment the initiating interest includes auction parameters such as the length of the accumulation period.

In step the user communicates the desired dissemination parameters. In the preferred embodiment there are many dissemination parameters available to the user the most important being various measures of certified contra interest. In the preferred embodiment the user can specify certified contra interest from 1 live executable orders 2 past executed trades or 3 canceled orders that were once executable but were not filled. Examples of CTI based filtering of dissemination of an interest to buy 500 000 shares of a certain stock include limiting dissemination to 1 MPs or other system users presently offering 10 000 or more shares of that stock in the marketplace 2 MPs or other system users who have sold over 25 000 shares of that stock in the current trading session 3 MPs or other system users who have offered blocks of over 10 000 shares of that stock in the current trading session or 4 MPs or other system users who have bought at or above the National market Best Offer in the current trading session. The quantities and time horizons in these parameters are all selectable by the user.

In a preferred embodiment there are many other parameters available to the user that employ market information from the external data sources and the CTI user database to more accurately target dissemination to desired market participants. For example the user can choose to notify only those market participants with certain response or initiation statistics e.g. directing the CTI manager to notify only market participants who have responded to 10 of CTI notifications received in a certain time frame or to a certain total number of CTI notifications . In addition the preferred embodiment enables the user to target MPs with certain known holdings in the security of interest. The preferred embodiment also enables users to exclude MPs from notification on the basis of their history of trade breaks e.g. preventing CTI information from reaching any MP who has broken some quantity of trades in some period of time . The preferred embodiment also enables users to include or exclude specific MPs from notification by name or identification number.

In an alternate preferred embodiment the user can also target MPs based on more sophisticated analysis performed by the CTI manager on the trading patterns of various users to identify certain correlations or pattern recognition e.g. buyer of technology stocks sector rotation etc. . In another preferred embodiment the user can exclude MPs based on any identified inappropriate trading behavior such as front running and peg gaming stored in the CTI user database . In another alternate embodiment the dissemination parameters are system defined and not selectable by the user. In yet another alternate embodiment the user can choose between defining some or all of the dissemination parameters and using system defined default parameters.

Referring back to at step the CTI manager accesses the necessary CTI information from the external data sources and the CTI user database to perform the CTI filtering analysis. At step the CTI manager analyzes CTI information using the dissemination parameters and produces a list of MPs to notify. At step the CTI manager further reduces the MP notification list using the MP notification parameters stored in the CTI user database . At step the CTI manager sends notification of the confidential initiating CTI to those MPs for which 1 the MP fits the initiating user s dissemination parameters and 2 the initiating interest fits the MP s notification parameters. In an alternate embodiment the notification includes statistics regarding the initiating user s past auctions e.g. proportion filled cancel rate frequency of trade breaks etc. .

In an alternate preferred embodiment after step the initiating user is shown a summary of the results of this analysis and is given the option of modifying the dissemination parameters given in step to more accurately tailor limit the dissemination of confidential CTI. For example a user can modify dissemination parameters that are too inclusive e.g. too many MPs have sold 10 000 or more shares of the relevant security today or exclusive e.g. there are no MPs who currently have a live order to sell over 50 000 shares . The production of the MP notification list is an iterative process in this embodiment as the embodiment repeats steps until the user is satisfied with the output of the dissemination analysis. The user interaction in this iterative process is performed through interface means that are well known in the art.

An alternate embodiment enables the notified MPs to simultaneously submit a trading interest and send a message to the initiating user to directly negotiate a trade. Another alternate embodiment enables the notified MPs to respond via a private chat session to directly negotiate a trade. Alternate preferred embodiments also enable the MP to respond in a semi private negotiation chat session with the initiating user and some or all of the other notified MPs. The system provides the chat and messaging functionality using interactive communication technology as is well known in the art. Alternate preferred embodiments also provide the notified MPs with the initiating user s phone number and or e mail address to provide other channels of direct communication.

In step the auction server accumulates orders from the notified MPs. In the preferred embodiment the duration of the accumulation period is set by the initiating user in the auction parameters communicated in step subject to a system defined minimum and maximum. This enables users of the CTI system to initiate auctions at any time and limit them to MPs with verified contra interest in sharp contrast with the POSIT system in which users must wait for periodic matching sessions which are not targeted in any way. In alternate embodiments there is a fixed system defined accumulation period. In another preferred embodiment the system sets the end of the accumulation period subject to a minimum and maximum. If possible the system sets the end of the accumulation period to match the end of the accumulation period of any other pending auction so that the auctions can be combined to increase total liquidity. In the preferred embodiment during the accumulation period the initiating user and the notified MPs can modify or cancel their orders placed in the auction server. Alternate embodiments place restrictions on this ability. For example an alternate embodiment does not permit the initiating user to cancel the auction after notified MPs have responded with contra orders the initiator is locked into the order once a MP has relied on it to respond with a contra order.

In step the auction server of a preferred embodiment prioritizes the contra orders sent by notified MPs. The preferred embodiment creates an execution priority by the following sequential rules 1 Total matched size Combinations of contra orders are chosen which maximize total size executed. 2 Price limit If competing MP contra orders would produce equal matched quantities the auction server will first execute MP contra orders with more aggressive price limits. 3 Size limit If competing MP contra orders have the same or no price limit the auction server will first execute orders with more aggressive size limits. 4 Time of entry If competing MP contra orders have the same size limit the auction server will first execute orders entered earlier.

Alternate embodiments that employ different execution priority rules will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example one alternate embodiment ignores the size limit of the contra order in another alternate embodiment where there are no price limits and actual execution is at the market midpoint at the moment of matching execution priority is by time of entry.

The above description assumes that the initiating interest is the only order on one side and all orders sent to the auction server by notified MPs are on the contra side. It is possible that a notified MP responds with an order on the same side as the initiating interest necessitating an execution priority for that side as well. In a preferred embodiment the initiating interest has absolute execution priority over subsequent MP orders. This is an additional benefit of the CTI system from the initiating user s perspective. The system enables the initiating user to target dissemination of a confidential trading interest to MPs with a certified contra interest to influence the auction timing and obtain priority in matching over contra orders placed in response. All orders placed by notified MPs on the same side as the initiating interest are executed only after the initiating interest is filled and according to the execution priority outlined above. Once again alternate embodiments that employ different execution priority rules will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Furthermore in an alternate embodiment the initiating interest is not granted absolute priority over competing orders subsequently placed by notified MPs and must compete according to the ordinary execution priority.

In another embodiment more than one auction can be combined to pool liquidity. In a combined auction each initiating interest is given exclusivity over contra orders placed by notified MPs in response to that respective initiating order. By exclusivity it is meant that a contra order placed in response to an initiating order cannot be matched with any other order until the initiating order is filled or canceled. In an alternate preferred embodiment there is no priority or exclusivity granted to the initiating orders in a combined auction and all orders compete according to the same execution priority. Alternate embodiments that employ other means of combining auctions will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In step the auction server executes the orders according to the execution priority set in step all at a price set by the type of auction employed. If there are no MP responses or no trade is possible given the limit prices the auction is unsuccessful and is terminated. In a preferred embodiment the auction server employs a midpoint cross auction where all orders are executed at market midpoint at a certain time. To avoid peg gaming in the preferred embodiment the execution price is pegged to market at a random time during a ten minute fuzz period after the end of the accumulation period. In an alternate embodiment there is no fuzz period and the auction execution price is determined at a known time at the end of the accumulation period.

Alternate embodiments employ various other auction types. For example one alternate embodiment employs a sealed envelope auction where the limit price on all orders is kept confidential and a single price is chosen to maximize the size of the matched execution. Another embodiment employs a private outcry auction where the initiating user and all notified MP can see all orders and their limit prices as they accumulate and there is price competition among the responding MPs to trade with the initiating interest. The examples given assume that all orders are executed at the same price another alternate embodiment employs discriminatory pricing where all orders from responding MPs trade at their limit price. This list is not intended to be exhaustive as alternate embodiments that employ different auction types will be apparent to those skilled in the art. An alternate embodiment enables the initiating user to choose from more than one different auction type such as those described above.

In step the auction server informs the initiating user and all responding users of the status of their respective orders i.e. fill partial execution canceled open expired . In step the auction server of the preferred embodiment enables participants in the auction to communicate with each other and a system administrator to resolve any perceived errors. In a preferred embodiment this communication is via semi private chat messaging but alternate embodiments supply telephone contact information. Users can break the trade or negotiate an amendment during a temporary window after which the trade is final. The use of this window represents a tradeoff between the interest in instant finality to trades and the interest in minimizing the costs and disruption caused by errors. An alternate preferred embodiment does not offer a temporary window to negotiate changes to the executed auction. In step the CTI manager processes the auction activity and updates the CTI user information database to reflect the initiation response execution and trade break activity that took place.

In an alternate preferred embodiment the auction server also contains a depository of orders not related to an active auction. In this embodiment any user can place an order in the depository without initiating an auction or invoking CTI targeted notification. These orders are dormant until an auction is initiated in that stock at which time they are treated by the auction server as a response received from a notified MP in step . In an alternate embodiment the auction server performs a match at periodic intervals without any CTI initiation to clear out the depository of dormant orders. An alternate embodiment performs these auctions only when sufficient dormant interest has accumulated rather than at defined intervals. In yet another embodiment these orders are not dormant and are continuously executable subject to their price limit as in an ECN. Another embodiment enables live execution but with a price limit defined relative to an external price such as the market midpoint or a certain spread to the end of day VWAP.

In an alternate preferred embodiment there is no auction server or execution functionality and the CTI system functions as the targeted information dissemination mechanism depicted in . In this alternate embodiment after the notification process depicted in the CTI system does not perform the auction process depicted in but rather enables the notified MPs to respond to the initiating user via a private or semi private negotiation chat session as described above. Alternate preferred embodiments also provide the notified MPs with the initiating user s phone number and or e mail address to provide other channels of direct communication. After the initiating interest expires or is canceled the preferred embodiment updates the CTI user database to reflect the initiation and response activity.

In an alternate embodiment a third party matching facility such as Optimark uses the CTI system to drum up liquidity for a match then executes the match. For example a MP may send an order to Optimark and request that a notification be sent out announcing There is an order for DELL in Optimark for the next round please participate. In this embodiment there is no chat but there is an address in the example Optimark s where the match is to be executed.

In a further preferred embodiment the CTI system functions in a manner roughly analogous to a rating service. In this embodiment the system compares non certified disseminations of trading activity such as the disclosures on AutEx to actual certified information to generate a measure of the overall accuracy of market participants disclosures. This accuracy rating can be used by other market participants to discriminate among the disclosures on the basis of demonstrated trustworthiness. In another embodiment the CTI system rates a market participant s compliance with the MP s own stated trading limits. For example when a MP is negotiating a trade in order to receive a better price the MP may agree to be bound to a trading cap to demonstrate that the present order is not part of a much larger trading interest and that the MP is not simultaneously negotiating similar trades with other MPs. The CTI system can compare the MP s stated trading limits to actual certified information to generate a measure of the MP s demonstrated trustworthiness. This rating can be used by other MPs to accurately price the likelihood that a negotiated order is part of a much larger order.

In a further embodiment the CTI system monitors a MP s trading activity for correlation to inappropriate trading behavior to generate a behavior rating. In this embodiment the CTI system monitors MP activity for suspected front running. When the system becomes aware that a MP has been notified of a large trading interest e.g. from an auction notification on the system or through a CTI disseminated over the system the system monitors the subsequent trading activity of notified MPs to analyze correlation between their trading activity and the revealed CTI. In another embodiment the CTI system monitors MP activity for suspected peg gaming. The system monitors the trading activity of MPs participating in auctions on the CTI system or on another system such as POSIT in which the price is set relative to a market price such as the midpoint. This trading activity is monitored for negative correlation to represented auction orders e.g. MPs who sell while a buy order is represented in the auction which indicates a possible attempt to manipulate the price of the auction execution. In another embodiment the behavior rating also incorporates information regarding the MP s history of trade breaks.

In all of these rating service embodiments the MP being rated permits the CTI system to use confidential information to rate the MP s past behavior e.g. disclosures trade breaks inappropriate trading activity in order to receive better prices on future trades or more order flow. This rating information is stored in the CTI user database and can come in many forms as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Examples of ratings forms include numerical data percent divergence between disclosed and actual trading activity or between stated trading cap and actual trading activity boolean indicators has the market participant exhibited inappropriate trading behavior or not or scaled ratings rating from 1 to n that incorporates information regarding various trading activity scaled according to for example recency and frequency of certain activity degree of correlation to inappropriate behavior etc. . These examples are not exhaustive and many representations of the rating data will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In an alternate embodiment an MP may request that a rating certificate be provided to a potential counterparty to demonstrate to the counterparty the trustworthiness of the MP. The certificate is a certified report based on the MP s market behavior history.

These embodiments provide the described rating service function in addition to the auction and execution functionality described in the ratings can also be used as a dissemination parameter in these embodiments. Alternate embodiments that provide the rating function do not offer the execution functionality and operate as the targeted information dissemination mechanism depicted in the ratings can be used as a dissemination parameter in these embodiments as well. Further embodiments do not offer execution or targeted dissemination functionality and simply operate as a certification and rating system.
