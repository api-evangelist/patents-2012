title: Coaxial gyro accelerometer in a semiconductor substrate
abstract: A coaxial gyro accelerometer device in a semiconductor substrate for simultaneously sensing coaxial linear and rotational forces. An exemplary device includes a resonating cantilever beam within a substrate and a package having a resonating cavity. The package supports the substrate while allowing the beam to resonate. The substrate also includes a piezoresistor driver, a piezoresistor sensor, and a semiconductor interferometric optical gyro. The piezoresistor driver and sensor are incorporated within the beam. The driver electrothermally resonates the beam. The sensor piezoresistively senses a signal that relates to an acceleration force out-of-plane of the beam. A waveguide of the semiconductor interferometric optical gyro is incorporated in the substrate around the beam. The gyro senses rotational motion about the axis that is the same as the acceleration vector (out-of-plane of the beam). The gyro also includes a laser source and a light detector. The beam is formed contiguously from the semiconductor substrate.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under U.S. Government Contract No. SC 00100000000145 US Navy N00030 05 C 0007. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.

A pendulating integrating gyroscopic accelerometer PIGA is a type of accelerometer that can measure acceleration and simultaneously integrate this acceleration against time to produce a speed measure as well. The PIGA s main use is in inertial navigation systems INS for guidance of aircraft and most particularly for ballistic missile guidance. It is valued for its extremely high sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with operation over a wide acceleration range. The PIGA is still considered the premier instrument for strategic grade missile guidance though systems based on MEMS technology are attractive for lower performance requirements.

However the PIGA has significant size and weight that make it non optimum in many applications. Also the PIGA is a mechanical mechanism requiring high precision machining tolerances and thus is very expensive to manufacture.

The present invention provides an integrated interferometric gyroscope and accelerometer device for simultaneously sensing coaxial linear and rotational forces. An exemplary device includes a resonating cantilever RC beam within a substrate a sensor package having a cavity for the RC beam a piezoresistor driver a piezoresistor sensor and a semiconductor interferometric optical gyro. The piezoresistor driver and sensor are incorporated within the RC beam. The driver electrothermally resonates the RC beam. The sensor piezoresistively senses a signal that relates to an acceleration force out of plane of the RC beam. A waveguide of the semiconductor interferometric optical gyro is incorporated in the substrate around the RC beam. The gyro senses rotational motion about the axis that is the same as the acceleration vector out of plane of the RC beam . The gyro also includes a laser source and a light detector. The RC beam is formed from the semiconductor substrate. The gyro includes a spiraled waveguide that is coaxial with a center of gravity CG point of the corresponding RC beam. Each determined center point is the point at which the z axis passes through the respective RC beam.

In another aspect of the invention the light source and light detector laser diodes include a P N junction formed within a layer of the substrate.

In still another aspect of the invention the interferometric optical gyro further includes interface electronics formed in or on the substrate.

In yet another aspect of the invention the device includes a sensor package lid that is hermetically sealed with the sensor package.

The present invention is a gyro and accelerometer integrated into a single semiconductor substrate that is combinable into a three axis gyroscope accelerometer. As such the single semiconductor substrate has the ability to simultaneously sense linear and rotational forces.

As shown in an exemplary integrated gyro accelerometer device includes a semiconductor substrate layer that includes a semiconductor interferometric fiber optic gyro IFOG and a cantilever strain resistive beam . The cantilever strain resistive beam includes a resonating component . The cantilever strain resistive beam is driven electrothermally to resonate by means of an implanted piezoresistor driver . Change in beam resonance i.e. acceleration along the z axis is sensed piezoresistively by an implanted piezoresistor sensor . The piezoresistor implants are electrically coupled to a piezoresistor electronic component . In one embodiment the piezoresistor electronic component is also located on the cantilever strain resistive beam .

The piezoresistor electronic component includes an oscillator circuit not shown for driving the piezoresistor driver and a feedback circuit not shown for receiving signals from the piezoresistor sensor . The piezoresistor electronic component is connected to the piezoresistor elements via surface metal traces not shown . Other surface metal traces not shown connect the piezoresistor electronic component with one or more substrate die pads not shown . One or more bond wires are attached to the substrate die pads and to sensor package lead frame not shown .

In one embodiment the resonating cantilever RC beam is formed from a semiconductor material such as silicon gallium arsenide or comparable material with a thickness width length to allow it to resonate based on a mass spring configuration. Force due to acceleration is transformed into a load that acts axially z axis on the RC beam . The magnitude of the acceleration is related to the change in the RC beam s resonant frequency which is sensed based on the frequency of the signal sent to the driver and received by the sensor . The vector component of acceleration is perpendicular to the RC beam . A DC voltage is applied with a superimposed sinusoidal signal to the piezoresistor driver thus producing cyclic heating and cooling of the driver which causes the RC beam to deflect and oscillate. The piezoresistor sensor detects change in frequency of the RC beam . The resonating frequency change in the RC beam is due to the load generated by the acceleration component along the z axis. Acceleration sensor resolution is a function of the RC beam material thickness width length.

The RC beam is created from the semiconductor substrate using one of the following exemplary methods laser cut plasma etch water jet machined or other comparable methods see . The substrate is attached to a sensor package base having a resonating cavity . The resonating cavity is located below the RC beam thus allowing the RC beam to flex along the z axis.

The IFOG includes an optical waveguide that is incorporated on the substrate surrounding the resonating cantilever component with a rotational component wrapped around the vector of acceleration i.e. around the z axis . The optical waveguide is formed into the substrate in a spiral along the X Y plane or vertically in the Z plane see in . The IFOG also includes a light source laser diode a light detector photo diode and IFOG interface electronics i.e. integrated optics chip IOC . The light source laser diode and the light detector photo diode are in optical communication with the optical waveguide formed in the semiconductor substrate. The light source laser diode the light detector photo diode and or the IFOG interface electronics are in signal communication with the bond wires via surface metal traces not shown . The one or more bond wires are attached to the substrate die pads and to sensor package lead frame not shown . The IFOG senses a rotational force about an axis z axis that passes through the center of the optical waveguide in accordance with known gyro principles.
