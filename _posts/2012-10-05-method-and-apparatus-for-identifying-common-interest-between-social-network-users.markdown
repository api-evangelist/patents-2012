This invention relates generally to social networking systems and in particular to a social networking system capable of identifying common interests between users of the social networking system.

Social networking systems are online services computers platforms or websites or combinations thereof which facilitate the building of social networks or social relations among people. For example users of a social networking system can share interests arrange activities or even make real life connections. An Internet based social networking system can use representations profiles of the users social links of the users and various services to help the user to interact with and extend their social networks.

Using social networking systems a person can grow his her social network by discovering people who have similar interests or experiences. However it can take a substantial amount of time and effort to identify such people. Finding unfamiliar people who share one s interests is difficult. It is not uncommon that two strangers spend a long and awkward conversation and interaction online or face to face to discover their common interests or experience.

Even with current social networking systems designed to aid the process of connecting people the process is still primarily cumbersome and static. For example a typical social networking website requires users to provide biographical information by filling out profile forms. A user can disclose his or her interests by providing personal information such as professional interests career information interests in media political opinions and religious beliefs. A matching algorithm then uses the profile and interest data provided by the user to match other users who are determined to be like minded by the algorithm. However the success rate of the matching algorithm depends on the quality of the data entered by the users. For various reasons a user may provide incomplete inaccurate or even misleading data that does not well represent the actual interests of the user. Further users rarely bother to update their profile and interest data while their interests can constantly change over time. The profile and interest data only reflects a static and potentially inaccurate image of a user at the time when the user provides the profile and interest data. Therefore a matching algorithm such as discussed above can have a low success rate.

The technology introduced here provides the benefits of automatically identifying mutual interests between social networking system users without the need of users providing profile information describing themselves. In particular the technology introduced here includes a method for identifying mutual interests between users of a social networking system based on keyword phrases. A keyword phrase can include one or more words a phrase or a sentence and can even include symbols. The keyword phrases are generated from reverse keyword searches based on content objects in which users show interest. Content objects can include for example webpages posts messages pictures videos audios texts any other type of media content and logical containers of the media content. Unlike conventional keyword searches also referred to as forward keyword searches a reverse keyword search receives a content object as input and identifies keyword phrases that are related to the content object as output. These keywords phrases are ranked by a forward keyword search as highly likely match to the content object.

In accordance with the techniques introduced here therefore a method for identifying mutual interests between social networking system users is provided. The method in one embodiment includes identifying by a social networking system a content object with which a first user of the social networking system has interacted. The social networking associates a keyword phrase with the first user. The keyword phrase is associated with the content object. The social networking system further determines a mutual interest for the first user and a second user of the social networking system by identifying a match between the keyword phrase associated with the first user with a keyword phrase associated with the second user.

By monitoring user activities the social networking system automatically collects keyword phrases that are related to users interests based on the users interactions with content objects. The monitoring or tracking is subject to the user s privacy settings. The social networking system then identifies mutual interests among the users by comparing the keyword phrases associated with the users. There is typically no need of user interventions during the process. The system continues updating the keyword phrases based on the monitored user activities. Thus the interests of the users are presented by the keyword phrases automatically generated by the above process truthfully and dynamically.

Other aspects of the technology introduced here will be apparent from the accompanying figures and from the detailed description which follows.

References in this description to an embodiment one embodiment or the like mean that the particular feature function or characteristic being described is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Occurrences of such phrases in this description do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment nor are they necessarily mutually exclusive.

The social networking system disclosed herein can recognize users interests in a dynamic and continuous manner. The social networking system monitors the user activities to identify content objects in which the users show interests via interactions. The monitoring is subject to the user s privacy settings. Through reverse keyword searches based on the identified content objects the system generates keyword phrases to truthfully represent the users interests. Therefore the social networking system can make targeted matches between the users by comparing the updated keyword phrases accurately representing the users current interests. The social networking system can include one or more computers and or other processing devices.

The social networking system can further include components to exchange information with the third party website such as the application programming interface API component . The third party website can interact with the social networking system via an API component which is provided by the social networking system . For instance the third party website can perform operations supported by the API including performing queries to obtain information stored in the social networking system and providing results based on requests from the social networking system .

As shown in the social networking system includes a number of components to store information of objects represented in the social networking system as well as the relationships between the objects. The social networking system further includes components to enable clients interactively using the social networking system .

The social networking system includes an object store that stores information of various objects tracked by the social networking system . The tracking is subject to the user s privacy settings. These objects can present a variety of things with which a user may interact in the social networking system . The objects may include profiles of the users applications events groups to which users may belong pages content objects such as pictures videos audios texts or any other type of media content locations associated with users or other objects and concepts .

In one embodiment the object store can further store content objects representing data produced by users of the social networking system such as inbox messages status updates photos videos comments notes and postings. An object in the object store can represent an entity existing with the social networking system e.g. an application running on the social networking system a virtual entity that exists outside the domain of the social networking system e.g. a website or a real world entity e.g. a retail store or a sports team .

The object store can store all objects within the social networking system . Alternatively for virtual entities outside of the social networking system the object store can include pointers or references to the virtual entities such as the uniform resource locator URL of a media file or a webpage stored in a third party website. In addition the object store can also store metadata associated with the objects such as names describing the objects images representing the objects e.g. user profile pictures or one or more keyword phrases e.g. implemented as tags associated with the objects. A keyword phrase can contain one or more words. Different types of objects can have different types of metadata. For example a user object can have unique ID a name and keyword phrases describing characteristics of the user object . A content object can have a media type metadata a thumbnail image and keyword phrases describing the content of the content object . An object in the object store can contain information as a pointer or a reference to another object. For example a user object can contain a pointer to a location object to indicate that the user s current location.

In one embodiment the social networking system further includes a graph information store that stores information for a social graph of the social networking system . The social graph contains nodes representing the objects stored in the object store . The social graph further contains edges connecting the nodes to represent the relationships between the objects. The graph information store thus includes information of the relationships between the objects represented as the edges connecting the nodes.

The social graph can include different types of edges representing different relationships between objects. Various examples of edges in the social graph include an edge between two user objects representing that the users have a relationship in the social networking system e.g. are friends or have communicated viewed the other s profile or interacted in some way an edge between a user object and an application object representing that the user has used the application an edge between a user object and a group object representing that the user belongs to the group and an edge between a user object and a page object representing that the user has viewed the page to name just a few.

In one embodiment if one user establishes a relationship with another user in the social networking system the two users are each represented as a node and the edge between them represents the established relationship. The two users are then connected in the social network system. Continuing this example one of these users may send a message to the other user within the social networking system. This act of sending the message is another edge between those two nodes which can be stored and or tracked by the social networking system. The tracking is subject to the user s privacy settings. In one embodiment the message itself can be treated as a node i.e. an object in the social networking system .

In another embodiment one user may post a comment on an image that is maintained or monitored by the social networking system. This commenting interaction can create edges among the nodes representing the user the image and the posted comment. In yet another embodiment if a user confirms attending an event wherein the user and the event are nodes an edge between these two nodes represents the indication of whether or not the user will attend the event. Using a social graph therefore a social networking system may keep track of many different types of objects and edges the interactions and connections among those objects thereby maintaining an extremely rich store of socially relevant information. The monitoring and tracking are subject to the user s privacy settings.

In one embodiment edges in the graph information store can also have associated metadata such as a label describing the type of relationship e.g. friend as the label between two user objects or a value quantifying the strength of the relationship. Further a relationship degree or distance between any two objects can be ascertained by determining the number of edges on the shortest path between the objects. For example two user objects that have an edge between them e.g. denoting a friendship relationship have a relationship degree or distance of one and are considered first order connections. Similarly if a user object A is a first order connection of user object B but not of user object C and B is a first order connection of C then objects A and C have a relationship degree of two indicating that C is a second order connection of A and vice versa .

In one embodiment the social networking system adds or updates information to the graph information store in real time as it observes events taking place indicating relationships between the various objects such as a user interacting with an application . Additionally the graph information store can contain edges that are based on existing stored information from which relationships can be inferred. For example data for a group may indicate that some set of users has a membership relationship with that group and this information can be reflected in the graph information store .

In one embodiment the object store of the social network system stores information on the objects including the keyword phrases associated with the objects. illustrates an example of an object store for the social networking system. The object store includes a user object representing a user of the social networking system and another user object representing another user. The user object can include metadata such as a user ID a user profile a location and keyword phrases A B and C associated with the user object . Similarly the user object can include metadata such as a user ID a user profile a location and keyword phrases A and B associated with the user object . As shown in AG. the object store can include other objects besides the user objects and .

A user object can interact with other objects within the social network system including other user objects and content objects. The social network system identifies the interaction and adds edges into the social graph stored in the graph information store shown in to represent the relationship between the user object and the object with which the user object interacts. For example shows an example of a social graph stored in a graph information store. Node is a node in the social graph that represents the user object of . Node is a node in the social graph that represents the user object of . Node is a node in the social graph that represents a content object. In some embodiments the node can represents a content object such as an image a video an audio a text a post a webpage or a URL.

A user represented by the node also referred to as user interacts with the content object represented by the node also referred to as content object . For example the user may click to view a webpage . Or the user may comment on an image . Or the user may click a Like button of a video to indicate that the user likes the video . The social networking system detects the interaction between the user and the content object . Accordingly the graph information store adds an edge between the node and node to represent the interaction relationship between the nodes.

In one embodiment the social networking system looks for an object in the object store that is represented by the node . illustrates an example of the object store that includes the content object that is represented by the node of . The content object includes a number of keyword phrases A and B. In one embodiment the content object is a webpage and the keyword phrases A and B are the keyword phrases associated with the webpage.

In another embodiment the social networking system looks for an object in the object store that is represented by the node and finds no such object. The social networking system creates an object to be represented by the node .

Then the social networking system conducts a reverse keyword search on the content object. For example the content object is a webpage and the social networking system conducts reverse keyword search based on a URL of the webpage. If there is any keyword phrase returned from the reverse keyword search the social networking system includes the returned keyword phrase into the object of the object store . In yet another embodiment the social networking system finds existing keyword phrases associated with the object . And the social networking system still conducts a reverse keyword search for an update of the keyword phrases. If there is any difference between the keyword phrases returned and the existing keyword phrases the social networking system updates the object to reflect the latest search result of the reverse keyword search.

Once the social networking system identifies the content object and its associated keyword phrases A and B the social networking system associates the keyword phrases A and B to the user object based on the interaction represented by the edge of . After the associating the user object includes keyword phrases A B C as well as A and B as shown in .

The social networking system compares the keyword phrases included in the user object with keyword phrases included in another user object such as user object . In one embodiment the social networking system identifies a match between the keyword phrase B in the user object with the keyword phrase B in the user object . Based on the match between the keyword phrases B and B the social networking system determines a mutual interest that is suggested by the keyword phrases B and B for the users identified by the user objects and .

In one embodiment the social networking system can identify multiple matches between keyword phrases associated with two users of the social networking system. The match is not necessarily a one to one keyword phrase match. There can be a match between one keyword phrase associated with one user and multiple keyword phrases associated with another user. Or there can be a match between multiple keyword phrases associated with one user and multiple keyword phrases associated with another user. In another embodiment there can be multiple matches between keyword phrases associated with one user and keyword phrases associated with another user. The social networking system determines multiple mutual interests based on the keyword phrase matches.

In one embodiment the social networking system identifies a match when a keyword phrase associated with one user is identical to a keyword phrase associated with another user. In another embodiment the social networking system identifies a match when a keyword phrase associated with one user is closely related to a keyword phrase associated with another user. In yet another embodiment the social networking system identifies a match when a keyword phrase associated with one user is a synonym or an antonym of a keyword phrase associated with another user.

The social networking system monitors and analyzes the user activities to collect keyword phrases that represent interests of the users. The system compares the keyword phrases to identify mutual interests between the users. illustrates a scenario of identifying a mutual interest between two users of a social networking system. A user of a social networking system reads a webpage identified by a URL of the webpage . The webpage can be rendered by a browser program running a computer or a smart phone . The user clicks a Like button placed in the webpage to indicate that the user likes the content of the webpage . Accordingly the browser sends a message about the user s action to the social networking system . In one embodiment the message can include URL as an identification of the webpage . In some embodiments the social networking system can include a user activity track module not shown dedicated to monitor and detect users interaction with content objects. The monitoring and tracking are subject to the user s privacy settings.

In another embodiment a user of a social networking system interacts with a content object rendered in an application running on a user device e.g. a mobile device or a computer . The user device monitors the user activities related to the application. Once a user activity indicating that the user is interested in the content object is recognized the user device sends a message about the user s action to the social networking system in a similar manner as described in the previous paragraph. For instance the user activity can be that the user has been clicking the content object for more than a predetermined time period.

The social networking system conducts a reverse keyword search on the webpage . In one embodiment the reverse keyword search is conducted by a reverse keyword search engine inside the social networking system . In another embodiment the reverse keyword search was conducted on a third party server or cluster as a third party service.

The social networking system can receive one or more keyword phrases associated with the webpage as a result of the reverse keywords search. In the context of the description herein a keyword phrase can include one or more words a phrase or a sentence and can even include symbols. For example the social networking system identifies a keyword phrase colonization of mars from the reverse keyword search on the webpage . Based on the interaction between the user and the webpage the social networking system associates the keyword phrase colonization of mars to the user to suggest that the user is interested in the topic of colonization of mars. 

Similarly using a browser program another user of the social networking system posts a comment on the social networking system citing a webpage. . Accordingly the browser program sends a message about the user s action to the social networking system. In one embodiment the message can also include a URL of the webpage as identification of the content object. The social networking system conducts another reverse keyword search on the webpage . The social networking system identifies the same keyword phrase colonization of mars as a result of the reverse keyword search. Based on the interaction between the user and the webpage the social networking system associates the same keyword phrase colonization of mars to the user to suggest that the user is also interested in the topic of colonization of mars. 

The social networking system compares the keyword phrases associated with the user with the keyword phrases associated with the user . In one embodiment the social networking system includes a user match module to identify a keyword phrase match that both the users and are associated with the keyword phrase . Suggested by the shared keyword phrase the user match module determines a mutual interest for colonization of mars for both users and of the social networking system .

In one embodiment the social networking system can have a feature to introduce or recommend users who share one or more interests e.g. a People You Should Meet feature . For example the social networking system can send a private system message to a user indicating that another user shares a common interest with him her. Or the social networking system identifies that users A and B share a common interest and sends a notice to user A suggesting that user A attend an event because user B also plans to attend the event.

The social networking system can conduct the matchmaking functionality without users intervention. illustrates an example of the automatic matchmaking functionality of the social networking system. A user of the social networking system can set up the user profile of the user to instruct the social networking system that the user wants to opt in to the automatic matchmaking functionality. For example the user can click an opt in checkbox in a user profile interface webpage for the automatic matchmaking functionality. The user can further identify the geographic region in the user profile on which the matchmaking functionality should focus. In another embodiment the social networking system can automatically identify the geographic region based on the user profile and user activity history without intervention from the user . The choice that the user made is sent to the social networking system as an instruction .

Upon receiving the instruction the social networking system starts to track the user activities of the user including the user s interactions with content objects such as pictures videos audios texts or any other type of media content. There are various user interactions being tracked by the social networking system. For example the user can click and read a webpage post a comment to a posted message or click a Like button to express the appreciation of an online article. In one embodiment the social networking system includes a user activity track module dedicated to monitoring and detecting the users interaction with content objects. The monitoring and tracking are subject to the user s privacy settings.

Each time the social networking system detects a content object with which the user has interactions the social networking system conducts a reverse keyword search in its reverse keyword search engine based on the interacted content object . The social networking system may receive one or more keyword phrases associated with the content object . If the social networking system receives any keyword phrase the system associates the keyword phrase with the user .

Periodically the social networking system uses a user match module to search candidates who have keyword phrases matched with the keyword phrases associated with user among users located in the target geographic region. The search result varies over time since keyword phrases associated with users constantly evolve and increase. In one embodiment the social networking system provides the user with a list of candidates . The list of candidates is accompanied by the matched keyword phrases and certain profile information of the candidates. The social networking system can further provide links to communicate with the candidates. For example the user may click one entry of the list of candidates to access a user interface to provide and send a system message to a candidate. In some embodiments the system initially conceals the identities of the candidates from the user to protect user privacy. The system may later reveal the identity of a candidate once the candidate confirms the reveal request or the candidate starts to interact with the user . During the automatic matching process the user does not need to specify any characteristics of potential matching candidates.

The social networking system automatically tracks and analyzes the user s activities to assess the interests of the user . The tracking is subject to the user s privacy settings. Based on the information from the automatic tracking the social networking system is able to present matching candidates to the user periodically. In one embodiment the user can choose the frequency for receiving matching candidate suggestions. In another embodiment the social networking system automatically determines the frequency based on the user activities of the user and how often the keyword phrases associated with the user are updated.

The social networking system can include a reverse keyword search engine to generate keyword phrases based on the inputs of content objects. illustrates a sample reverse keyword search engine. In one embodiment the reverse keyword search engine is part of the social networking system. In another embodiment the reverse keyword search engine works as a third party server outside of the social networking system. As shown in the reverse keyword search engine includes a content object interface . The content object interface is configured to receive content objects or the identifications e.g. URLs of the content objects from the social networking system. The reverse keyword search engine further includes a keyword output interface . Once the reverse keyword search engine generates the keyword phrases associated with the received content object the keyword output interface sends the associated keyword phrases to the social networking system.

The reverse keyword search engine also includes a search pattern database to record the relationships between the content objects and the keyword phrases. As shown in the search pattern database contains a plurality of records . Each record includes an identifier of a content object and a keyword phrase associated with the content object. There can be multiple records having the same identifier and different keyword phrases . Similarly there can be multiple records having the same keyword phrases and different identifier . The record can further include metadata . In one embodiment the metadata can include a rank of the content object in a forward search result using the keyword phrase. A forward search is a conventional web search process that takes keyword phrases as input and outputs a list of related web pages or contents.

The reverse keyword search engine generates the records by conducting multiple forward searches using a forward search engine . In one embodiment for each forward search using a keyword phrase the first N number of search results i.e. content objects are considered to be associated with the keyword phrase N being a predetermined number. Accordingly the first N number of content objects are recorded along with the associated keyword phrase in the search pattern database . In one embodiment the forward search engine is built in as part of the reverse keyword search engine as illustrated in . In another embodiment the forward search engine can be a separate server outside of the reverse keyword search engine .

The processor s is are the central processing unit CPU of the storage controller and thus control the overall operation of the computer . In certain embodiments the processor s accomplish this by executing software or firmware stored in memory .

Also connected to the processor s through the interconnect are a network adapter and a storage adapter . The network adapter provides the computer with the ability to communicate with remote devices over a network and may be for example an Ethernet adapter or Fibre Channel adapter. The network adapter may also provide the computer with the ability to communicate with other computers within the social networking system. In some embodiments a computer may use more than one network adapter to deal with the communications within and outside of the system separately. The storage adapter allows the computer to access a persistent storage and may be for example a Fibre Channel adapter or SCSI adapter.

The code stored in memory may be implemented as software and or firmware to program the processor s to carry out actions described above. In certain embodiments such software or firmware may be initially provided to the computer by downloading it from a remote system through the computer e.g. via network adapter .

The techniques introduced herein can be implemented by for example programmable circuitry e.g. one or more microprocessors programmed with software and or firmware or entirely in special purpose hardwired circuitry or in a combination of such forms. Special purpose hardwired circuitry may be in the form of for example one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs programmable logic devices PLDs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs etc.

Software or firmware for use in implementing the techniques introduced here may be stored on a machine readable storage medium and may be executed by one or more general purpose or special purpose programmable microprocessors. A machine readable storage medium as the term is used herein includes any mechanism that can store information in a form accessible by a machine a machine may be for example a computer network device cellular phone personal digital assistant PDA manufacturing tool any device with one or more processors etc. .
