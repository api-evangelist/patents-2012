Home owners and the like have many options when it comes to protecting their homes and family. There are locks for doors and windows security systems fences etc. Many companies specialize in providing security systems for the home. These systems provide piece of mind as well as protection for the home owner and his her family. However a level of home owner responsibility may come with these systems. For example the home owner has to set the system every time he she leaves the home. Once set the home owner only has a few moments to get out of the home or he she will trigger the alarm. Furthermore when going to bed the home owner may have to set the system as well. In this case the home owner must not forget about setting the system when he she wakes up or he she may also trigger the alarm. Therefore these systems may not offer the security that may be required by the home owner because the systems may be inadvertently triggered or not activated at all.

Today modern handheld mobile devices such as smart phones or the like have the capability to facilitate payment for a cup of coffee or provide a boarding pass for a flight. These advances combine multiple technologies through a handheld mobile device to provide a user with an array of capabilities. For example many smart phones are equipped with significant processing power sophisticated multi tasking operating systems and high bandwidth Internet connection capabilities. Moreover such mobile devices often have additional features that are becoming increasingly more common and standardized features. Such features include but are not limited to location determining devices such as Global Positioning System GPS devices sensor devices such as accelerometers and high resolution video cameras.

As the capabilities of such mobile devices have increased so too have the applications i.e. software that can be used with the mobile devices. One such example of innovative software is a category known as augmented reality AR or more generally referred to as mediated reality. One such example of an AR presentment application platform is Layar available from Layar Amsterdam the Netherlands. The Layar platform technology analyzes location data compass direction data and the like in combination with information related to the objects locations or the like in a captured video stream to create browse able hot spots or tags that are superimposed on the mobile device display resulting in an experience described as reality browsing. 

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Embodiments of the present invention address the above needs and or achieve other advantages by providing apparatuses e.g. a system computer program product and or other devices and methods for using real time video analysis such as AR or the like on a mobile device to provide security to the user of mobile device at anytime without having to activate a security system.

Using real time video analysis such as augmented reality or the like the user may capture information regarding a frequented area such as the user s home office vehicle person relatives homes etc. The system reviews the captured information and stores the information in a memory device such that the system a baseline layout of objects and individuals that may be located in the frequented area may be established. The baseline layout of objects and individuals of a frequented area may be determined by analysis of several factors. These factors aid in determining objects around the area and inside the area such that variances between a captured image and a baseline layout may trigger an alert. An alert may be in the form of a text response audio response communication to authorities police fire medical and the like communications to financial institutions stop payment requests etc. communications to friends or family visual response etc. The factors include global position compass position of mobile device capturing image or video infrared data facial recognition radiation detection heat sensors including indications of stress levels mobile device recognition electro thermal sensors object recognition dimensional data movement recognition time of day and the like.

Based on these factors the system may continually capture images of the frequented area such that changes from the baseline layout may be monitored. For example if the user is sleeping in his her bed the system through the user s mobile device will continually capture images of the area around the mobile device. Therefore if the user sets his mobile device on his her night stand the mobile device will continue to capture images of the bedroom the interior of the home and some portions of the exterior of the home. Therefore if an intruder attempts to approach the home the system may alert the user by providing an indicator as to where the system believes the intruder is. Furthermore if the system recognizes an intruder in the home the system will contact the appropriate authority directly.

In some embodiments the system may provide indicators associated security compromises such as an intruder. In other embodiments the indicators may also provide indications associated with foreseen security issues within the frequented area. For example the system may provide an indicator to the user that he she forgot to lock the front door a window etc. In this way the system may suggest locking the door and or provide the user with a remote locking of the door such that the user may select the indicator on his her mobile device and remotely lock the door. In another example the user may have placed a tall ladder on the side of his her home where an intruder may be able to use the ladder to gain access to a second story of the home. In still other embodiments the system may recognize individuals that frequent the user s frequented area such as friends family etc. The system may determine those individual s normal moving patterns. Thus if the individual falls or is hurt the system may detect it and provide the user notice via an indicator.

In some embodiments the user may select the indicator associated with the security compromise or the security issue. The system will then provide the user with more information about the security compromise or issue and potential remedies for that compromise or issue. For example if the system provides an indicator associated with an intruder in the user s home office the system will in some embodiments automatically contact the police department. In other embodiments the indicator may allow the user to contact the police department be selecting the indicator. Furthermore the indicator may direct the user to a financial institution that may provide instantaneous stop payment for all credit cards and add security to the other financial institution accounts.

Embodiments of the invention relate to systems methods and computer program products for providing security to a user comprising capturing via a mobile device a first image of an area frequented by the user a directory of data relating to the area frequented by the user wherein the directory comprises information regarding objects and individuals within the area frequented by the user wherein the directory of data is built using the captured first image of the area frequented by the user receiving via a mobile device a captured second image of the area frequented by the user subsequent to the directory of data being built recognizing variations between the directory and the captured second images with respect to the objects and the individuals within the area frequented by the user through the user of a processor device and presenting indicators associated with the variations via the mobile device of the user a recommended security action based on the variations between the directory and the captured second image.

In some embodiments presenting the indicators associated with the variations may comprise superimposing the indicators associated with the variations over real time video that is capture by the mobile device of an area frequented by the user wherein the location of the objects and the individuals within the area frequented by the user other than the variations correspond to the directory of data relating to the area frequented by the user.

In some embodiments the directory may comprise information regarding the objects that are normally found within the area frequented by the user. The directory may also comprise information regarding the individuals that are normally found within the area frequented by the user.

In some embodiments the captured second image of the area frequented by the user is captured using real time imaging of the area frequented by the user. Furthermore receiving the captured second image of the area frequented by the user may comprise receiving real time images of the area frequented by the user continuously while the mobile device is in the area frequented by the user.

In some embodiments presenting an indicator associated with the variation may comprise displaying the indicator on a display of the mobile device. Furthermore presenting an indicator associated with the variation comprises superimposing the indicator over real time video that is captured by the mobile device. The indicator is selectable by the user. Upon selection of the indicator the system may provide information regarding the variation based on security information related to the area frequented by the user.

Embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to elements throughout. Where possible any terms expressed in the singular form herein are meant to also include the plural form and vice versa unless explicitly stated otherwise. Also as used herein the term a and or an shall mean one or more even though the phrase one or more is also used herein.

While embodiments discussed herein are generally described with respect to real time video streams or real time video it will be appreciated that the video stream may be captured and stored for later viewing and analysis. Indeed in some embodiments video is recorded and stored on a mobile device and portions or the entirety of the video may be analyzed at a later time. The later analysis may be conducted on the mobile device or loaded onto a different device for analysis. The portions of the video that may be stored and analyzed may range from a single frame of video e.g. a screenshot to the entirety of the video. Additionally rather than video the user may opt to take a still picture of the environment to be analyzed immediately or at a later time. Embodiments in which real time video recorded video or still pictures are analyzed are contemplated herein.

Some embodiments of the invention herein are generally described as involving frequented areas. Frequented areas may include areas that are frequented by the user such as but not limited to the user s home office vehicle relatives homes apartment etc. Frequented areas may also include the user s person. For example the system may recognize the location on the user that the user keeps his her wallet purse and or the like. In this way the system may recognize and alert the user when he she is missing his wallet or when it is in a different location than that determined by the baseline layout.

Next in block a determination is made as to which images from the real time video stream are associated with frequented areas associated with the user of a mobile device. The determination is made by analyzing the real time video stream to determine areas that the user has been to several times in the past. In this way a the objects individuals logos dimensions compass information and or other frequented area indicating features may be analyzed to determine what is within the video stream field and create a baseline based on the user visiting the area several times. In this way the system may receive information about objects that may move to different locations within the area such as clothing dishes etc. and recognize that these objects are normal and do not present a security issue or compromise. In this way objects may move about a frequented area and the variations in the area may not be flagged if the movements are also recognized when establishing the baseline layout. The system may then provide indicators of security compromised or security issues associated with objects within the frequented area based on several factors. These factors include global position compass position of mobile device capturing the image or video infrared data facial recognition radiation detection heat sensors including indications of stress levels mobile device recognition electro thermal sensors object recognition dimensional data movement recognition time of day and the like.

Thereafter at block one or more indicators are presented on the display of the mobile device in conjunction with the real time video stream. In some embodiments the indicators are presented when the user captures a frequented area. Each of the indicators is associated with a variation of the image from the baseline layout as compared to the current image of the frequented area. The images associated with the frequented areas are matched with baseline objects and individuals of that frequented area such that objects that are not recognized within the baseline are tagged with indicators as variations of the frequented area and possible security compromises or security issues. For example if the user is in his her home and also in the home is his her family dog and an electrician working. The system may recognize that in that particular frequented area the user s family and dog are included as baseline objects or individuals. Therefore the user s family and dog also frequent that user s frequented area. However the system may provide an indicator associated with the location of the electrician. This is because the electrician may not be including in the baseline objects or individuals for that location thus the electrician is a variation to the frequented area. Therefore the user may select the indicator associated with the electrician and indicate to the system that the electrician is not a security compromise or security issue. Furthermore the system may notice changes within the baseline objects or individuals. For example a difference in an individual s normal walking pattern may indicate that the individual is hurt or has fallen. In this way the system may recognize the accidental fall and report it to the user or the proper authorities.

The indicator may take various forms such as display of a tag a highlighted area a hot spot or the like. In specific embodiments the indicator is a selectable indicator such that a user may select e.g. click on hover over touch the display provide a voice command and or the like the object within the frequented area or indicator to provide display of specifics related to the object within the frequented area. In some embodiments the indicator itself may provide the information or a portion of the information to the user. In addition the information related to object within the frequented area or the frequented area itself may include a review of the object or area by the system.

The network may be a global area network GAN such as the Internet a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN or any other type of network or combination of networks. The network may provide for wireline wireless or a combination wireline and wireless communication between devices on the network.

In some embodiments the user is an individual. The user may be any individual wishing to use real time video analysis for security. The security functions may be directed to frequented areas such as but not limited to the individual s person home family friends relatives homes apartment office and or the like.

The user may be in range of any frequented area for which the user may wish to consider implementing using the real time video system. In some embodiments the user may have to activate the system such that the system will receive images from the mobile device. At this point the system may determine if the area is a frequented area. In some embodiments the system will automatically be activated such that the mobile device will continuously send images to the system without requiring action from the user . At this point the system will automatically determine and locate frequent areas when the user approaches a frequented area with his her mobile device. For example the system will know when the mobile device is on the user s person because the captured image will be the user s pocket. In another example the system may recognize with the user is in his her vehicle or at his her home without the user having to activate the system. In this way the system may provide the user with security information specifically indications as to security compromises and security issues at all times the user has his her mobile device with him her and in the on position.

As illustrated in the real time video image server generally comprises a communication device a processing device and a memory device . As used herein the term processing device generally includes circuitry used for implementing the communication and or logic functions of the particular system. For example a processing device may include a digital signal processor device a microprocessor device and various analog to digital converters digital to analog converters and other support circuits and or combinations of the foregoing. Control and signal processing functions of the system are allocated between these processing devices according to their respective capabilities. The processing device may include functionality to operate one or more software programs based on computer readable instructions thereof which may be stored in a memory device.

The processing device is operatively coupled to the communication device and the memory device . The processing device uses the communication device to communicate with the network and other devices on the network such as but not limited to the mobile device and the security system server . As such the communication device generally comprises a modem server or other device for communicating with other devices on the network .

In some embodiments the processing device may also be capable of operating one or more applications such as one or more applications functioning as an artificial intelligence AI engine. The processing device may recognize frequented areas or objects it has identified in prior uses by way of the AI engine. In this way the processing device may recognize objects within a frequented area and store information related to the recognized objects in one or more memories and or databases discussed herein. Once the AI engine has thereby learned of an object and or frequented area the AI engine may run concurrently with and or collaborate with other modules or applications described herein to perform the various steps of the methods discussed. For example in some embodiments the AI engine recognizes an object that has been recognized before and stored by the AI engine. The AI engine may then communicate to another application or module of the mobile device and or server an indication that particular object being a part of a specific frequented area. For example a dog may be captured via real time video stream and the AI engine may recognize that the dog captured is the user s dog and may further realize that the dog is typically located in the frequented area of the user s home. In this regard the AI engine may provide a starting point from which to determine the frequented that the user may be located. In other embodiments the AI engine s recognition of an object and or frequented area is accepted as the final recognition of the object or area.

As further illustrated in the real time video image server comprises computer readable instructions stored in the memory device which in one embodiment includes the computer readable instructions of a server application . In some embodiments the memory device includes data storage for storing data related to security information including but not limited to data created and or used by the server application or a directory created by the user .

In the embodiment illustrated in and described throughout much of this specification the server application may analyze frequented areas captured by a user using a real time video stream. The server application analyzes factors associated with the frequented area to provide a baseline layout for the area and to determine variances in the baseline. The factors the server application analyzes includes but is not limited to global position compass position of mobile device capturing image or video infrared data facial recognition radiation detection heat sensors including indications of stress levels mobile device recognition electro thermal sensors object recognition dimensional data movement recognition time of day and the like.

Once the server application analyzes the frequented area of the user the server application provides the user a virtual frequented area incorporating baseline layouts and individuals. The baseline layout provides the system with a baseline for future capturing of the frequented area such that variances within the area may be recognized. For example if facial recognition determines an individual or animal in the frequented area during the baseline layout then during subsequent capturing of that frequented area a different individual is determined by facial recognition then the system will recognize that variation.

In some embodiments the server application may further determine if the variation reaches the level of a security compromise or security issue. A security compromise comprises a breach within the frequented area. In some embodiments a breach may include an identification of an individual such as an intruder within the frequented area. In other embodiments a breach may include a broken window door pocket or the like that may be an indication as to an individual within the frequented area without the user providing the individual an invitation. A security issue is an issue with the frequented area that may arise to an easy security compromise by an intruder. For example a security issue may be unlocked doors open door open garage door unlocked windows open windows. Security issues may also include items that the user has left around the frequented area such as but not limited to ladders shovels hammers etc. that are easily retrievable by the intruder. In this way the system may provide the user with recommendations as to the safest way to eliminate security issues. Security issues may also be issues that the system recognizes that may prevent fires. For example the system may recognize that a smoke detector in a home has a low battery.

In some embodiments the server application may further provide aid to the user upon a security compromise or issue occurring. For example if the system recognizes an intruder in the user s home the system may contact the authorities. In another example if the system determines that an intruder has already broken into the user s home the system may contact the authorities and the user s insurance. The system may further determine what items where stolen if any by the intruder and provide that information to the authorities and the insurance. Furthermore the server application may recognize if financial information has been seen or stolen by an intruder. In this way the system may automatically send a communication to the financial institution to initiate a freeze on all of the accounts that the intruder may have stolen.

The data stored within the server application provides computer readable instructions to the processing device to allow for system to determine variations within the frequented area such that the system may recognize possible security compromises or security issues. The server application stores the data regarding the frequented area such as the layout baseline individuals and other aspects of the area determined by the factors so that the server application may compare the baseline for that frequented area with any subsequent capturing of that area using real time images.

In some embodiments as described in further detail below the server application may recognize a marker and or objects within an environment . The marker may be interpreted with respect to data in the memory device and be recognized as a possible variation within the frequented area of the user . In this way the real time video image server provides marker interpretations and analysis with respect to the data and baseline layout of the frequented area on the real time video image server .

In some embodiments the server application may analyze the real time video stream at all times while the mobile device is in the on position. In this way the system may monitor the frequented area it receives the image from at all times throughout the day. If the user is walking down the street and his her mobile device is in his her pocket. The system will recognized the mobile device in the user s pocket as a frequented area. Therefore if a variation with respect to the objects in the frequented area or user s person occurs the user may receive notice of that change. For example if the user typically wears a necklace the necklace is included in the baseline layout. Therefore if the system receives a captured image of the user and the system through use of one of the factors recognizes that the user does not have on the necklace the system may notify the user . In another embodiment the system may recognize that the user always has a wallet in his her back right pocket. If a wallet is not recognized by the system the system may alert the user of the fact that there is no wallet in his her back right pocket. Furthermore if the system is analyzing the real time video stream at all times the system will determine changes within the frequented area during the passing of time. For example the system may recognize a wallet in the back pocket of the user then recognize that the wallet is no longer there. But instead of immediately notifying the user the system may wait to determine if the user took the wallet out of his her pocket to make a purchase or the like. However if the wallet is not returned or the factors indicate that the user is not located near a purchase location but instead in a high crime area the system may alert the user .

An alert may include a notification sent to the user s mobile device a friend or family member s telephone or mobile device authority such as police fire and or the like. A notification may be in the form of a voice notification text message sound notification etc.

The server application may also provide indicators to the user associated with variations in a frequented area. These indicators explained in further detail below are associated with the variation and upon selection may provide system recommendations regarding the variation. For example if the system recognizes that a door in a home is unlocked the system will provide an indicator associated with that door on the display of the mobile device . Upon selection of the indicator the user may receive an update as to why the door hand an indicator or a recommendation. For example the system may providing and indicator and update the user that the door is unlocked and that is why an indicator is associated with the door. Furthermore the system may recommend that the user lock the door.

As further illustrated is an environment in which the user utilizes a mobile device to capture real time video of an environment in an augmented reality experience. As described in further detail below with respect to the mobile device may be any mobile communication device. The mobile device has the capability of capturing real time video of the surrounding environment . The real time video capture may be by any means known in the art. In one particular embodiment the mobile device is a mobile telephone equipped with a camera capable of video capture.

The environment contains a number of objects . Objects include but are not limited to a frequented area objects in the frequented area and or the like that the user may wish to utilize the system for. Some of such objects may include an marker identifiable to the mobile device if the object is a variation from the baseline layout of the frequented area. A marker may be any type of marker that is a distinguishing feature that can be interpreted to identify specific objects . In some embodiments the marker may be interpreted by the mobile device . In other embodiments the marker may be interpreted by the real time video image server . In yet other embodiments the marker may be interpreted by both the mobile device and the real time video image server . For instance a marker may be alpha numeric characters symbols logos shapes ratio of size of one feature to another feature a product identifying code such as a bar code electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves e.g. radio frequency identification RFID architectural features color etc. In some embodiments the marker may be audio and the mobile device may be capable of utilizing audio recognition to identify words or unique sounds broadcast. The marker may be any size shape etc. Indeed in some embodiments the marker may be very small relative to the object such as the alpha numeric characters that identify the name or model of an object whereas in other embodiments the marker is the entire object such as the unique shape size structure etc.

In some embodiments the marker is not actually a physical marker located on or being broadcast by the object . For instance the marker may be some type of identifiable feature that is an indication that the object is nearby. In some embodiments the marker for an object may actually be the marker for a different object . For example the mobile device may recognize a particular building as being Building A. Data stored in the data storage may indicate that Building B is located directly to the east and next to Building A. Thus marker for an object that are not located on or being broadcast by the object are generally based on fixed facts about the object e.g. Building B is next to Building A . However it is not a requirement that such a marker be such a fixed fact. The marker may be anything that enables the mobile device and or the financial institution application to interpret to a desired confidence level what the object is. For example the mobile device object recognition application and or AR presentation application may be used to identify a particular person as a first character from a popular show and thereafter utilize the information that the first character is nearby features of other characters to interpret that a second character a third character etc. are nearby whereas without the identification of the first character the features of the second and third characters may not have been used to identify the second and third characters. This example may also be applied to objects outside of people.

The marker may also be or include social network data such as data retrieved or communicated from the Internet such as tweets blog posts social networking site posts various types of messages and or the like. In other embodiments the marker is provided in addition to social network data as mentioned above. For example mobile device may capture a video stream and or one or more still shots of a large gathering of people. In this example as above one or more people dressed as characters in costumes may be present at a specified location. The mobile device object recognition application and or the AR presentation application may identify several social network indicators such as posts blogs tweets messages and or the like indicating the presence of one or more of the characters at the specified location. In this way the mobile device and associated applications may communicate information regarding the social media communications to the user and or use the information regarding the social media communications in conjunction with other methods of object recognition. For example the mobile device object recognition application and or the AR presentation application performing recognition of the characters at the specified location may confirm that the characters being identified are in fact the correct characters based on the retrieved social media communications. This example may also be applied objects outside of people.

In some embodiments the mobile device and or server accesses one or more other servers social media networks applications and or the like in order to retrieve and or search for information useful in performing an object recognition. In some embodiments the mobile device and or server accesses another application by way of an application programming interface or API. In this regard the mobile device and or server may quickly search and or retrieve information from the other program without requiring additional authentication steps or other gateway steps.

In some embodiments markers may be recognized by the server application . For example the server application may identify a marker as being a variation in the frequented area the server application may then provide real time data indicating whether the variation is a potential security issue or security compromise. For example the marker may identify an electrician in the frequented area the system may determine that that new variation to the frequented area is not a security issue or security compromise.

While illustrates that the objects with markers only include a single marker it will be appreciated that the object may have any number of markers with each equally capable of identifying the object . Similarly multiple markers may be identified by the mobile device such that the combination of the markers may be utilized to identify the object . For example the facial recognition may identify a person as a famous athlete and thereafter utilize the uniform the person is wearing to confirm that it is in fact the famous athlete.

In some embodiments a marker may be the location of the object . In such embodiments the mobile device may utilize GPS software to determine the location of the user . As noted above a location based marker could be utilized in conjunction with other non location based markers identifiable and recognized by the mobile device to identify the object . However in some embodiments a location based marker may be the only marker . For instance in such embodiments the mobile device may utilize GPS software to determine the location of the user and a compass device or software to determine what direction the mobile device is facing in order to identify the object . In still further embodiments the mobile device does not utilize any GPS data in the identification. In such embodiments markers utilized to identify the object are not location based.

As further illustrated is a security system server is operatively coupled to the real time video image server and the mobile device . The security system server has systems with devices the same or similar to the devices described for the real time video image server i.e. communication device processing device and memory device . Therefore the security system server communicates with the real time video image server and the mobile device in the same or similar way as previously described with respect to each system. In some embodiments the security system sever may already provide the user a home security system for his her home vehicle office etc. In this way the server application may be linked to the user s current home security system thus providing correlating security. For example the system may provide the user information updating his her home security system reminding him her to activate the home security system which may be done remotely via the mobile device or the like. The security system server in some embodiments may be accessed by the real time video image server so that the real time video image server may determine and or predict the likelihood of a security issue or security compromise. Furthermore the security system server allows for contact to security system providers and the like such that the real time video image server may be aware of the potential that a specific variation may cause a security issue or security compromise.

The mobile device may generally include a processing device communicably coupled to such devices as a memory device user output devices user input devices a network interface a power source a clock or other timer a camera a positioning system device one or more chips etc.

In some embodiments the mobile device and or the server access one or more databases or datastores not shown to search for and or retrieve information related to the object and or marker. In some embodiments the mobile device and or the server access one or more datastores local to the mobile device and or server and in other embodiments the mobile device and or server access datastores remote to the mobile device and or server. In some embodiments the mobile device and or server access both a memory and or datastore local to the mobile device and or server as well as a datastore remote from the mobile device and or server

The processing device may include functionality to operate one or more software programs or applications which may be stored in the memory device . For example the processing device may be capable of operating a connectivity program such as a web browser application . The web browser application may then allow the mobile device to transmit and receive web content such as for example location based content and or other web page content according to a Wireless Application Protocol WAP Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP and or the like.

The processing device may also be capable of operating applications such as an object recognition application and or an AR presentment application . The object recognition application and or the AR presentment application may be downloaded from a server and stored in the memory device of the mobile device . Alternatively the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application may be pre installed and stored in a memory in the chip . In such an embodiment the user may not need to download the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application from a server. In this way the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application may remain at the server such as the real time video image server within the server application .

The object recognition application provides the mobile device with object recognition capabilities. In this way objects such as products and or the like may be recognized by the object itself and or markers associated with the objects . This is described in further detail below with respect to . In this way the object recognition application may communicate with other devices on the network to determine the object within the real time video stream.

The AR presentment application provides the mobile device with AR capabilities. In this way the AR presentment application may provide superimposed indicators related to the object in the real time video stream such that the user may have access to the targeted offers by selecting an indicator superimposed on the real time video stream. The AR presentment application may communicate with the other devices on the network to provide the user with indications associated with targeted offers for objects in the real time video display. The presentation and selection of indicators provided to the user via the AR presentment application is described in further detail below with respect to .

The mobile device may also be configured to operate in accordance with non cellular communication mechanisms such as via a wireless local area network WLAN or other communication data networks.

The network interface may also include an application interface in order to allow a user to execute some or all of the above described processes with respect to the object recognition application the AR presentment application and or the chip . In some embodiments the application interface may further execute some or all of the above described processes with respect to the server application . The application interface may have access to the hardware e.g. the transceiver and software previously described with respect to the network interface . Furthermore the application interface may have the ability to connect to and communicate with an external data storage on a separate system within the network . In some embodiments the external data is stored in the memory device of the real time video image server .

As described above the mobile device may have a user interface that includes user output devices and or user input devices . The user output devices may include a display e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or the like and a speaker or other audio device which are operatively coupled to the processing device . The user input devices which may allow the mobile device to receive data from a user may include any of a number of devices allowing the mobile device to receive data from a user such as a keypad keyboard touch screen touchpad microphone mouse joystick other pointer device button soft key and or other input device s .

The mobile device may further include a power source . Generally the power source is a device that supplies electrical energy to an electrical load. In some embodiment power source may convert a form of energy such as solar energy chemical energy mechanical energy etc. to electrical energy. Generally the power source in a mobile device may be a battery such as a lithium battery a nickel metal hydride battery or the like that is used for powering various circuits e.g. the transceiver circuit and other devices that are used to operate the mobile device . Alternatively the power source may be a power adapter that can connect a power supply from a power outlet to the mobile device . In such embodiments a power adapter may be classified as a power source in the mobile device .

The mobile device may also include a memory device operatively coupled to the processing device . As used herein memory may include any computer readable medium configured to store data code or other information. The memory device may include volatile memory such as volatile Random Access Memory RAM including a cache area for the temporary storage of data. The memory device may also include non volatile memory which can be embedded and or may be removable. The non volatile memory may additionally or alternatively include an electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory or the like.

The memory device may store any of a number of applications or programs which comprise computer executable instructions code executed by the processing device to implement the functions of the mobile device described herein. For example the memory device may include such applications as an object recognition application an AR presentment application a web browser application an SMS application an email application etc.

The object recognition application may use any type of means in order to identify desired objects . For instance the object recognition application may utilize one or more pattern recognition algorithms to analyze objects in the environment and compare with markers in data storage which may be contained within the mobile device such as within chip or externally on a separate system accessible via the connected network such as but not limited to the real time video image server . For example the pattern recognition algorithms may include decision trees logistic regression Bayes classifiers support vector machines kernel estimation perceptrons clustering algorithms regression algorithms categorical sequence labeling algorithms real valued sequence labeling algorithms parsing algorithms general algorithms for predicting arbitrarily structured labels such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields ensemble learning algorithms such as bootstrap aggregating boosting ensemble averaging combinations thereof and the like.

Upon identifying an object within the real time video stream the AR presentment application is configured to superimpose a virtual image on the mobile device display . The virtual image is generally a tab or link displayed such that the user may select the virtual image and retrieve information related to the identified object. The information may include any desired information associated with the selected object and may range from basic information to greatly detailed information. In some embodiments the virtual image may provide the user with an internet hyperlink to further information on the object . The information may include for example all types of media such as text images clipart video clips movies or any other type of information desired. In yet other embodiments the virtual image information related to the identified object may be visualized by the user without selecting the virtual image .

In embodiments in which the virtual image provided by the AR presentment application provides an interactive tab to the user the user may select the virtual image by any conventional means for interaction with the mobile device . For instance in some embodiments the user may utilize an input device such as a keyboard to highlight and select the virtual image in order to retrieve the information. In a particular embodiment the mobile device display includes a touch screen that the user may employ to select the virtual image utilizing the user s finger a stylus or the like.

In some embodiments the virtual image is not interactive and simply provides information to the user by superimposing the virtual image onto the display . For example in some instances it may be beneficial for the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application to merely identify an object just identify the object s name title give brief information about the object etc. rather than provide extensive detail that requires interaction with the virtual image . The mobile device is capable of being tailored to a user s desired preferences.

Furthermore the virtual image may be displayed at any size on the mobile device display . The virtual image may be small enough that it is positioned on or next to the object being identified such that the object remains discernible behind the virtual image . Additionally the virtual image may be semi transparent such that the object remains discernible behind the virtual image. In other embodiments the virtual image may be large enough to completely cover the object portrayed on the display . Indeed in some embodiments the virtual image may cover a majority or the entirety of the mobile device display .

The user may opt to execute the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application at any desired moment and begin video capture and analysis. However in some embodiments the AR presentment application includes an always on feature in which the mobile device is continuously capturing video and analyzing the objects within the video stream. In such embodiments the object recognition application may be configured to alert the user that a particular object has been identified. The user may set any number of user preferences to tailor the AR experience to his needs. For instance the user may opt to only be alerted if a certain particular object is identified. Additionally it will be appreciated that the always on feature in which video is continuously captured may consume the mobile device power source more quickly. Thus in some embodiments the always on feature may disengage if a determined event occurs such as low power source or if the user sets a certain time of day to disengage etc. Conversely if the always on feature is disengaged due to the occurrence of such an event the user may opt for the always on feature to re engage after the duration of the disengaging event e.g. power source is re charged etc. .

In some embodiments the user may identify objects that the object recognition application does not identify and add it to the data storage with desired information in order to be identified and or displayed in the future. For instance the user may select an unidentified object and enter a name title and or any other desired information for the unidentified object . In such embodiments the object recognition application may detect record certain markers about the object so that the pattern recognition algorithm s or other identification means may detect the object in the future. Furthermore in cases where the object information is within the data storage but the object recognition application fails to identify the object e.g. one or more identifying characteristics or markers of the object has changed since it was added to the data storage or the marker simply was not identified the user may select the object and associate it with an object already stored in the data storage . In such cases the object recognition application may be capable of updating the markers for the object in order to identify the object in future real time video streams.

In addition in some embodiments the user may opt to edit the information or add to the information provided by the virtual object . For instance the user may opt to include user specific information about a certain object such that the information may be displayed upon a future identification of the object . Conversely in some embodiments the user may opt to delete or hide an object from being identified and a virtual object associated therewith being displayed on the mobile device display .

Furthermore in some instances an object may include one or more markers identified by the object recognition application that leads the object recognition application to associate an object with more than one object in the data storage . In such instances the user may be presented with the multiple candidate identifications and may opt to choose the appropriate identification or input a different identification. The multiple candidates may be presented to the user by any means. For instance in one embodiment the candidates are presented to the user as a list wherein the strongest candidate is listed first based on reliability of the identification. Upon input by the user identifying the object the object recognition application and or the AR presentment application may learn from the input and store additional markers in order to avoid multiple identification candidates for the same object in future identifications.

Additionally the object recognition application may utilize other bases for identification than identification algorithms. For instance the object recognition application may utilize the user s location time of day season weather speed of location changes e.g. walking versus traveling busyness e.g. how many objects are in motion versus stationary in the video stream as well any number of other conceivable factors in determining the identification of objects . Moreover the user may input preferences or other metrics for which the object recognition application may utilize to narrow results of identified objects .

In some embodiments the AR presentment application may have the ability to gather and report user interactions with displayed virtual objects . The data elements gathered and reported may include but are not limited to frequented locations objects within the frequented location and variations of those objects. Such user interactions may be reported to any type of entity desired.

In some embodiments the information provided by the real time video stream may be compared to data provided to the system through an API. In this way the data may be stored in a separate application and be implemented by request from the mobile device and or server.

At block the user may capture images of frequented areas or objects therein as part of a real time video stream. In some embodiments the user may point his her mobile device at a frequented area such as a home apartment vehicle person relatives homes etc. In other embodiments the user may opt to have the system always on such that frequented areas will continue to be captured and security will continued to be monitored via the system and indicators will be introduced for variances within the frequented area. Furthermore the user may be notified upon security compromises or security issues.

Once the user has captured images the system may receive information associated with the image . The image may be a single frame of video e.g. a screenshot an entirety of a video or any portion in between. Additionally rather than video the user may opt to take a still picture of the environment. The image may further comprise of multiple single images compiled together. In some embodiments the system may recognize the frequented area within the captured image.

Once the server application or mobile device receives the information associated with the image the system may compile the data regarding objects and individuals in the frequented area as illustrated in block . In this way a baseline layout of the area may be established. In some embodiments once the baseline layout has been established the system may determine if the information associated with the image is a variation from the baseline layout of the frequented area. The baseline layout of the frequented area may be further established by factors.

At block the system established a baseline for the frequented area based on factors. These factors include global position compass position of mobile device capturing image or video infrared data facial recognition radiation detection heat sensors including indications of stress levels mobile device recognition electro thermal sensors object recognition dimensional data movement recognition time of day and the like. These factors allow the system to determine if an area is frequented by the user the objects within the area and the normal positioning of those objects. In this way a baseline may be established such that when the area is captured again the system may determine the variations in the objects and individuals within the area.

Global position and compass positioning provides an indication as to location of the frequented area the crime rate in the area the laws and regulations of the area etc. Infrared data allows the system to visualize through obstructions all places of frequented areas of the user . Furthermore in some embodiments the infrared data may detect the locations of individuals or intruders in the frequented areas. For example the system may recognize via infrared that the family members of the user sleeping in their beds. Therefore if an individual is recognized in the frequented area the system may recognize the individual as an intruder. Facial recognition provides an indication as to the identification of an individual s identification such that the system may recognized and distinguish between an intruder and an individual that is not an intruder. Radiation detection may provide an indication of radioactive activity or other types of harmful chemicals within the frequented area. In this way the user may be notified of explosives or other possible harmful chemicals. Heat sensors may determine elevated heat levels of individuals. In this way heat sensors may be able to predict robberies or the like prior to the robbery occurring. For example the heat sensors may notice an individual within the user s frequented area that has an elevated heat signature. The system may alert the user of this elevated heat signature which may be a sign of stress or anxiousness in preparation to commit a crime. Mobile device recognition may recognize the mobile devices within a user s frequented area. The system may access databases to determine the owner of the mobile devices within the user s area. In this way the system may alert the user if a convicted criminal sex offender or the like is located in the user s frequented area. Mobile device recognizers may also recognize computer processing chips RFID chips or the like. These may include chips that individuals have implanted within pets themselves etc.

The system reviews the existing frequented area such that a baseline layout is established for the individuals and objects within the area are established at belonging or being normal to the area. That way if one of those objects is broken or misplaced the system may recognize that. Furthermore the system may recognize individuals that may be allowed to be in the frequented area or individuals that may be intruders.

The system may the store the established baseline for the frequented areas in block . The baseline may be stored in a directory within the system based on the information sent to the system. For example if the user is using real time video stream to identify his her home the data from the image the user took may provide data to the server application or the mobile device such that the factors associated with home that have been previously analyzed may be known and compared for variations.

The directory comprises databases as mentioned above that have information relating to a verity of frequented areas of different users . The databases contain information about the frequented areas with respect to the factors and be able to instantly access the information regarding the frequented area when a new image of the frequented area is provided.

At block the variations are analyzed to determine of they are security compromises or security issues. Analyzing the variation allows the system to determine the severity of the variation. For example a high severity variation may include a security compromise such as an intruder located in the frequented area. Whereas a low severity variation may include an unlocked door or open window.

If it is determined that the severity of the variation is high then in decision block the system may automatically send a communication to the proper authorities or first responders in block . For example if a fire is detected in the frequented area by an analysis of the factors the high severity of that variation may trigger the system sending a communication to the fire department. Once the communication is made to the authorities the user is notified of the system s communication to the first responder in block .

If it is determined that the severity of the variation is not high enough to warrant a communication to authorities or first responders the system makes a determination as to whether the mobile device is still capturing video stream of the frequented area. If no video stream is being captured then no indicator is presented in block . If a video stream is still being captured then in block indicators are continuing to be presented with respect to variations within the frequented area. The indicators are associated with variations within the frequented area in a virtual area environment. In some embodiments the virtual area environment may be in current time. In some embodiments the system may provide the virtual area environment in future time. In yet other embodiments the virtual area environment may be captured and the system may allow the user to communicate the captured image via social networking email texting or the like such that friends family authority such as police and fire departments and other individuals.

In some embodiments the user may select the indicator. The selected indicator may allow the user to obtain further detail about the variation in the frequented area in block . In some embodiments selecting the indicator provides the user the ability to contact the appropriate authority based on the variation. For example if the variation is a security compromise the system may allow the user to contact the police. In some embodiments as explained in detail above the system may automatically contact the police if the security compromise is severe in nature.

If the user selects the indicator in block the user may be provided further detail about the variation in the frequented area such as the properties of the variation and the reason the system provided an indicator for it. The variation may be categorized as a security compromise a security issue or just a variation.

Furthermore the indicator may provide a suggested response to the variation in block . The suggested response may comprise many different responses dependent on the variations associated with the indicator. For example the responses may include but are not limited to contacting authority locking or shutting a door or a window moving an object stopping payment of financial accounts etc. In yet other embodiments the user may be provided an offer to purchase the recommendation such as new batteries for a smoke detector a locking device for a door etc. In block the user may select the suggested response. Selecting the suggested response may include purchasing the suggested response if applicable. Purchasing the response via selecting the response on the indicator associated with the variation may be made by the user using the mobile device such as a mobile wallet i.e. smart phone PDA etc. or other types of payment options such as credit cards checks cash debit cards loans lines of credit virtual currency etc. that allows the user to make a transaction to purchase an item associated with a suggested response.

In various embodiments information associated with or related to one or more objects that is retrieved for presentation to a user via the mobile device may be permanently or semi permanently associated with the object. In other words the object may be tagged with the information. In some embodiments a location pointer is associated with an object after information is retrieved regarding the object. In this regard subsequent mobile devices capturing the object for recognition may retrieve the associated information tags and or pointers in order to more quickly retrieve information regarding the object. In some embodiments the mobile device provides the user an opportunity to post messages links to information or the like and associate such postings with the object. Subsequent users may then be presenting such postings when their mobile devices capture and recognize an object. In some embodiments the information gathered through the recognition and information retrieval process may be posted by the user in association with the object. Such tags and or postings may be stored in a predetermined memory and or database for ease of searching and retrieval.
