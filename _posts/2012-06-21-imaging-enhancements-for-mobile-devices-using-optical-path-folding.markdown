Many modern electronic mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers are driven by market requirements to be increasingly thin and more powerful. Many of these electronic mobile devices include one or more cameras used for capturing still images and or video. As with other functions of the electronic mobile devices the cameras used are driven by market requirements to improve performance particularly in the form of improved image and or video quality. The improvements in overall imaging quality may result in increased image resolution increased low light sensitivity decreased image noise increased color accuracy increased image uniformity and or other image quality characteristics.

However improvements in the camera performance are often constrained by the requirement that the camera fit into an increasingly thin electronic mobile device. Traditionally improving camera quality implies using a larger image sensor and or a lens with a larger diameter. As a consequence of the traditional approach the distance from the image sensor of the camera to the lens the optical track must be increased in order to accommodate the larger sensor and or lens. Instead market requirements suggest that optical tracks should be as short as possible in order to fit within increasingly thin electronic mobile devices thus limiting the image quality of the cameras.

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods that can operate in an image capture device. More specifically embodiments of the disclosure relate to systems and methods for extending the effective focal length of an image capture device thereby producing improvements in image quality and or a smaller image capture device. In the context of this disclosure an image capture device can include a camera video camera a mobile device with an integrated image capture device or other devices suitable to capturing imagery and or video as can be appreciated. In some embodiments an image capture device according to an embodiment of the disclosure can include a device such as a smartphone tablet computing system laptop computer desktop computer or any other computing device that has the capability to receive and or capture imagery via image capture hardware.

Accordingly image capture device hardware can include components such as lenses image sensors e.g. charge coupled devices CCD complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS etc. processor s image signal processor s a main processor memory mass storage or any other hardware or software components that can facilitate capture of imagery and or video. In some embodiments an image signal processor can be incorporated as a part of a main processor in an image capture device module that is in turn incorporated into a device having its own processor memory and other components.

Referring next to shown are various views of one possible embodiment of the lens system into which an image sensor is attached. The provides a cutaway lateral side view of the embodiment of the lens system . The provides a top side view of the embodiment of the lens system . The embodiment comprises a primary mirror a secondary mirror the image sensor and potentially other auxiliary components not described herein. The primary mirror may be a spherical or parabolic mirror with a reflective surface facing the secondary mirror the reflective surface being suitable for reflecting visible light e.g. aluminum glass mirror silver glass mirror aluminum coated with silicon dioxide etc. . The dimensions of primary mirror comprise a radius of curvature a diameter and a focal length . For a primary mirror of a spherical shape the focal length is one half the radius of curvature . The diameter of the primary mirror may typically be in the range of approximately 50 100 of the radius of curvature .

The secondary mirror may be a circular flat mirror with a reflective surface facing the primary mirror the reflective surface being suitable for reflecting visible light e.g. aluminum glass mirror silver glass mirror aluminum coated with silicon dioxide etc. . The secondary mirror is suspended a height from the floor of the primary mirror . The secondary mirror further has a diameter that is less than the diameter of the primary mirror thus creating an aperture between the secondary mirror and the wall of the primary mirror .

The image sensor may be centrally affixed to the floor of the primary mirror with the sensing portion of the image sensor facing the secondary mirror . To this end the image sensor may be affixed to the surface of the primary mirror the primary mirror may have a notch in which to embed the image sensor and or the image sensor may be affixed to the primary mirror using other techniques as can be appreciated. The image sensor may be square rectangular or other possible shapes. The example embodiment shown in includes a square image sensor having a length .

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the lens system is provided. The following operations may be initiated by a user attempting to capture an image using the image capture device . To begin a shutter of the lens system opens allowing light to enter the interior of the lens system . The light passes through the aperture and strikes the reflective surface of the primary mirror . The light is reflected or folded at an angle from the surface of the primary mirror and strikes the reflective surface of the secondary mirror . The light is reflected again from the secondary mirror toward the image sensor .

The lens system may be constructed such that the distance of the path of light from the point it is first reflected from the primary mirror until it strikes the image sensor is equal to the focal length of the primary mirror . Satisfying this equation may determine the height of the flat mirror the aperture the length of the image sensor the number of folds of the light as well as other possible dimensions of components of the lens system .

As a non limiting example the primary mirror may have radius of curvature of 20 millimeters mm and a diameter of 20 mm. Using the aforementioned formula for a spherically shaped primary mirror the primary mirror would have a focal length of 10 mm. In order to produce a twice folded path of light that also has a length of 10 mm suggests that the height of the secondary mirror should be approximately 5 mm above the floor of the primary mirror .

Given these dimensions of the example lens system having an optical track of 5 mm one can observe that employing an image sensor with a typical thickness of 1 mm or less will result in a package that may be no more than 6 mm thick. Using a traditional optical path that does not employ optical folding an optical track and hence the optical path of 5 mm will accommodate an image sensor of approximately 5 mm square. Using present image sensor pixel densities an image sensor of 5 mm would be capable of capturing an 8 megapixel image.

However using optical path folding of the present disclosure a 5 mm optical track would create a 10 mm optical path allowing an image sensor of up to 10 mm square. As a result of the increased allowable size of the image sensor a 2 increase in this example the image sensor may offer increased image capture resolution up to 4 32 megapixels increased sensitivity improved electro optical characteristics and or other possible improvements.

The embodiment comprises a primary mirror a secondary mirror the image sensor and potentially other auxiliary components not described herein. Variations of this embodiment may further comprise a primary refractive lens and or a secondary refractive lens as shown in . The primary refractive lens and or the secondary refractive lens may be used to further improve optical quality by removing aberrations adding functionality such as an optical zoom and or to reduce the optical track of the lens system .

Satisfying this equation may determine the height of the secondary mirror the curvature radius of the secondary mirror the aperture the length of the image sensor the number of folds of the light as well as other possible dimensions of components of the lens system .

As a non limiting example the primary mirror may have radius of curvature of 20 mm and a diameter of 20 mm. Using the aforementioned formula for a spherically shaped mirror the primary mirror would have a focal length of 10 mm. Using a secondary mirror with a diameter of 13 mm and a curvature radius of 13 mm suggests that the height of the secondary mirror should be approximately 7.5 mm.
