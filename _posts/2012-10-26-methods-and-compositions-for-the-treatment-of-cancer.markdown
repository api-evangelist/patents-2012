In some preferred embodiments the variant has one or a limited number of amino acid substitutions e.g. conservative or non conservative substitutions additions or deletions e.g. truncations compared to wild type enzyme.

As used herein the term interest site when used in reference to a ribonuclease refers to a region subregion and or amino acid residue within the ribonuclease e.g. human ribonuclease that is modified or targeted for modification e.g. for deletion substitution or other type of mutation to create a ribonuclease variant . Accordingly an interest site may be characterized as a high interest site a medium interest site or a low interest site based on characteristics of the ribonuclease described herein e.g. biologic activity e.g. ribonucleolytic activity cancer cell killing activity oligomerization capacity etc. desired to be retained within the ribonuclease after modification of the same e.g. for deletion substitution or other type of mutation to create a ribonuclease variant etc. . For example sites that may be of interest are depicted in . The level of interest in modification of the residues in the ribonucleases is indicated by the use of the following symbols low interest site medium interest site 0 and high interest site . In addition secondary structure is noted where a or a alpha helix b or b beta sheet. Contemplated sites of the ribonuclease that bind to substrate RNA are also labeled B1 and B2 substrate base binding site P1 main active site and P2 and P 1 substrate phosphate binding sites. Cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond are labeled by disulf. Contact points that have been identified for the ribonuclease inhibitor are labeled with RI . For angiogenin the putative receptor binding site is labeled as Rec. 

The term heterologous nucleic acid sequence or heterologous gene are used interchangeably to refer to a nucleotide sequence which is ligated to a nucleic acid sequence to which it is not ligated in nature or to which it is ligated at a different location in nature. Heterologous DNA is not endogenous to the cell into which it is introduced but has been obtained from another cell. Generally although not necessarily such heterologous DNA encodes RNA and proteins that are not normally produced by the cell into which it is expressed. Examples of heterologous DNA include reporter genes transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences selectable marker proteins e.g. proteins which confer drug resistance or therapeutic benefits etc.

As used herein the term immunoglobulin or antibody refer to proteins that bind a specific antigen. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric and humanized antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments and includes immunoglobulins of the following classes IgG IgA IgM IgD IgE and secreted immunoglobulins sIg . Immunoglobulins generally comprise two identical heavy chains and two light chains. However the terms antibody and immunoglobulin also encompass single chain antibodies and two chain antibodies.

As used herein the term antigen binding protein refers to proteins that bind to a specific antigen. Antigen binding proteins include but are not limited to immunoglobulins including polyclonal monoclonal chimeric and humanized antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments and Fab expression libraries and single chain antibodies.

The term epitope as used herein refers to that portion of an antigen that makes contact with a particular immunoglobulin.

When a protein or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal numerous regions of the protein may induce the production of antibodies which bind specifically to a given region or three dimensional structure on the protein these regions or structures are referred to as antigenic determinants . An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen i.e. the immunogen used to elicit the immune response for binding to an antibody.

The terms specific binding or specifically binding when used in reference to the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide means that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure i.e. the antigenic determinant or epitope on the protein in other words the antibody is recognizing and binding to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins in general. For example if an antibody is specific for epitope A the presence of a protein containing epitope A or free unlabelled A in a reaction containing labeled A and the antibody will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.

As used herein the terms non specific binding and background binding when used in reference to the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide refer to an interaction that is not dependent on the presence of a particular structure i.e. the antibody is binding to proteins in general rather that a particular structure such as an epitope .

As used herein the term subject refers to any animal e.g. a mammal including but not limited to humans non human primates rodents and the like which is to be the recipient of a particular treatment. Typically the terms subject and patient are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject.

As used herein the term subject suspected of having cancer refers to a subject that presents one or more symptoms indicative of a cancer e.g. a noticeable lump or mass or is being screened for a cancer e.g. during a routine physical . A subject suspected of having cancer may also have one or more risk factors. A subject suspected of having cancer has generally not been tested for cancer. However a subject suspected of having cancer encompasses an individual who has received a preliminary diagnosis e.g. a CT scan showing a mass but for whom a confirmatory test e.g. biopsy and or histology has not been done or for whom the stage of cancer is not known. The term further includes subjects who once had cancer e.g. an individual in remission . A subject suspected of having cancer is sometimes diagnosed with cancer and is sometimes found to not have cancer.

As used herein the term subject diagnosed with a cancer refers to a subject who has been tested and found to have cancerous cells. The cancer may be diagnosed using any suitable method including but not limited to biopsy x ray blood test and the diagnostic methods of the present invention. A preliminary diagnosis is one based only on visual e.g. CT scan or the presence of a lump and antigen tests.

As used herein the term subject at risk for cancer refers to a subject with one or more risk factors for developing a specific cancer. Risk factors include but are not limited to gender age genetic predisposition environmental exposure and previous incidents of cancer preexisting non cancer diseases and lifestyle.

As used herein the term non human animals refers to all non human animals including but are not limited to vertebrates such as rodents non human primates ovines bovines ruminants lagomorphs porcines caprines equines canines felines ayes etc.

As used herein the term gene transfer system refers to any means of delivering a composition comprising a nucleic acid sequence to a cell or tissue. For example gene transfer systems include but are not limited to vectors e.g. retroviral adenoviral adeno associated viral and other nucleic acid based delivery systems microinjection of naked nucleic acid polymer based delivery systems e.g. liposome based and metallic particle based systems biolistic injection and the like. As used herein the term viral gene transfer system refers to gene transfer systems comprising viral elements e.g. intact viruses modified viruses and viral components such as nucleic acids or proteins to facilitate delivery of the sample to a desired cell or tissue. As used herein the term adenovirus gene transfer system refers to gene transfer systems comprising intact or altered viruses belonging to the family Adenoviridae.

 Amino acid sequence and terms such as polypeptide or protein are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule.

The terms test compound and candidate compound refer to any chemical or biological entity pharmaceutical drug and the like that is a candidate for use to treat or prevent a disease illness sickness or disorder of bodily function e.g. cancer . Test compounds comprise both known and potential therapeutic compounds. A test compound can be determined to be therapeutic by screening using the screening methods of the present invention.

As used herein the term sample is used in its broadest sense. In one sense it is meant to include a specimen or culture obtained from any source as well as biological and environmental samples. Biological samples may be obtained from animals including humans and encompass fluids solids tissues and gases. Biological samples include blood products such as plasma serum and the like. Environmental samples include environmental material such as surface matter soil water and industrial samples. Such examples are not however to be construed as limiting the sample types applicable to the present invention.

The term gene refers to a nucleic acid e.g. DNA sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor e.g. ribonucleases or ribonuclease conjugates of the present invention . The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties e.g. enzymatic activity etc. of the full length or fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the including sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5 and 3 ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full length mRNA. The sequences that are located 5 of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5 untranslated sequences. The sequences that are located 3 or downstream of the coding region and that are present on the mRNA are referred to as 3 untranslated sequences. The term gene encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non coding sequences termed introns or intervening regions or intervening sequences. Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA hnRNA introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or spliced out from the nuclear or primary transcript introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA mRNA transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide.

The term wild type refers to a gene or gene product that has the characteristics of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designed the normal or wild type form of the gene. Wild type protein may be produced by synthetic methods. Wild type proteins include but are not limited to forms that include post translational modifications such as glycosylation as well as any preprocessed forms. In contrast the terms modified mutant and variant refer to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in sequence when compared to the wild type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally occurring mutants can be isolated these are identified by the fact that they have altered nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence when compared to the wild type gene or gene product. This is in contrast to synthetic mutants that are changes made in a sequence through human or machine intervention.

The term fragment as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino terminal and or carboxy terminal deletion as compared to the native protein but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the amino acid sequence deduced from a full length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 4 amino acids long preferably at least 20 amino acids long usually at least 50 amino acids long or longer and span the portion of the polypeptide required for intermolecular binding of the compositions with its various ligands and or substrates. In some embodiments fragments posses an activity of the native protein.

As used herein the term purified or to purify refers to the removal of impurities and contaminants from a sample. For example antibodies are purified by removal of non immunoglobulin proteins they are also purified by the removal of immunoglobulin that does not bind an intended target molecule. The removal of non immunoglobulin proteins and or the removal of immunoglobulins that do not bind an intended target molecule results in an increase in the percent of target reactive immunoglobulins in the sample. In another example recombinant polypeptides are expressed in host cells and the polypeptides are purified by the removal of host cell proteins the percent of recombinant polypeptides is thereby increased in the sample.

The term expression vector as used herein refers to a recombinant DNA molecule containing a desired coding sequence and appropriate nucleic acid sequences necessary for the expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. Nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression in prokaryotes usually include a promoter an operator optional and a ribosome binding site often along with other sequences. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters enhancers and termination and polyadenylation signals.

As used herein the term host cell refers to any eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell e.g. bacterial cells such as yeast cells mammalian cells avian cells amphibian cells plant cells fish cells and insect cells whether located in vitro or in vivo. For example host cells may be located in a transgenic animal.

In some embodiments the present invention provides human ribonuclease RNase 1 proteins that are used to treat or cure diseases particularly cancer and viral infections. The compositions also find use in diagnostic applications e.g. associated with drug screening or cancer characterization and research applications. RNase 1 can be used as stand alone reagent or incorporated into general or specific delivery systems such as polymers dendrimers liposomes polymeric nanoparticles or block copolymer micelles. RNase 1 may also be co administered with other drugs and compounds. A variety of human RNases are now known e.g. Zhang et al. Nucleic Acids Research 31 602 2003 Zhang et al. Nucleic Acids Research 30 1169 2002 herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Previous experiments See Cancer Res. 64 4870 2004 did not demonstrate a reduction in tumor volume with administration of human RNase 1 human pancreatic RNase . In contrast the present invention demonstrates that human RNase 1 and variants having similar activities and properties are effective in reducing tumor volume in animals.

In some embodiments it is contemplated that RNase 1 is able to make chemotherapy or radiation resistant cells susceptible to standard or lower levels of treatment so that lower doses are effective and side effects reduced. In addition RNase 1 is contemplated to provide benefit when used in combination with radiotherapy or other interventions including but not limited to antibodies small molecules or gene therapy.

In some embodiments the compositions and methods of the present invention are used to treat diseased cells tissues organs or pathological conditions and or disease states in a subject organism e.g. a mammalian subject including but not limited to humans and veterinary animals or in in vitro and or ex vivo cells tissues and organs. In this regard various diseases and pathologies are amenable to treatment or prophylaxis using the present methods and compositions. A non limiting exemplary list of these diseases and conditions includes but is not limited to breast cancer prostate cancer lymphoma skin cancer pancreatic cancer colon cancer melanoma malignant melanoma ovarian cancer brain cancer primary brain carcinoma head neck cancer glioma glioblastoma liver cancer bladder cancer non small cell lung cancer head or neck carcinoma breast carcinoma ovarian carcinoma lung carcinoma small cell lung carcinoma Wilms tumor cervical carcinoma testicular carcinoma bladder carcinoma pancreatic carcinoma stomach carcinoma colon carcinoma prostatic carcinoma genitourinary carcinoma thyroid carcinoma esophageal carcinoma myeloma multiple myeloma adrenal carcinoma renal cell carcinoma endometrial carcinoma adrenal cortex carcinoma malignant pancreatic insulinoma malignant carcinoid carcinoma choriocarcinoma mycosis fungoides malignant hypercalcemia cervical hyperplasia leukemia acute lymphocytic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia chronic granulocytic leukemia acute granulocytic leukemia hairy cell leukemia neuroblastoma rhabdomyosarcoma Kaposi s sarcoma polycythemia vera essential thrombocytosis Hodgkin s disease non Hodgkin s lymphoma soft tissue sarcoma osteogenic sarcoma primary macroglobulinemia and retinoblastoma and the like T and B cell mediated autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases infections hyperproliferative diseases AIDS degenerative conditions vascular diseases and the like. In some embodiments the cancer cells being treated are metastatic. In other embodiments the RNases of the present invention target cancer stem cells.

In some embodiments the present invention contemplates the use of wild type human RNase 1. Wild type human RNase 1 include all forms of the enzyme including but not limited to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of wild type RNase 1 encoded by nucleic acids of different sequences as well as glycosylated lipidated and other modifications including covalent and non covalent modifications.

The present invention further contemplates variants of wild type human RNase 1 e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . A modified peptide can be produced in which the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide has been altered such as by substitution deletion addition e.g. insertion modifications e.g. addition of additional molecules such as polyethylene glycol PEG or post translational modifications e.g. glycosylation . In some embodiments insertions are insertions of large peptide segments e.g. targeting proteins . Insertions have been made into proteins to incorporate additional functionality such as recognition sequences e.g. Characterization of an Adenovirus Vector Containing a Heterologous Peptide Epitope in the HI Loop of the Fiber Knob J. Virology 1998 72 1844 . Additionally the insertion may replace certain amino acids within the protein. The amino acids to be replaced may be selected to be similar in nature to sequences where insertions of amino acids can be placed including unstructured or loop regions e.g. Transplantation of a 17 amino acid a helical DNA binding domain into an antibody molecule confers sequence dependent DNA recognition PNAS 1995 92 5214 . The insertion may be another copy of the ribonuclease protein either inserted at one of the termini or into the length of the first sequence. In other embodiments variant RNase 1 of the present invention comprises a modified amino acid. In particularly preferred embodiments these modifications do not significantly reduce the enzymatic activity or other desired activity or property of the modified human RNase 1. In other words construct X can be evaluated in order to determine whether it is a member of the genus of modified or variant RNase 1 of the present invention as defined functionally.

Preferred variants maintain at least 1 at least 5 at least 15 at least 30 at least 50 preferably at least 60 even more preferably at least 75 still more preferably at least 85 yet more preferably at least 95 and most preferably at least 99 of the activity of wild type human ribonuclease 1. In some embodiments the activity is enzymatic e.g. degradation of RNA activity. In other embodiments activity is killing of cells e.g. cancer cells . In other embodiments preferred variants have similar properties as the wild type human RNase 1. For example exemplary preferred properties include but are not limited to the speed of protein folding and ease of manufacturability and low immunogenicity or toxicity in animals or lack of weight loss in animals administered the RNase 1. It should be noted that in some embodiments one of the activities or properties is rendered less desirable but another is rendered desirable such that overall the enzyme is useful e.g. increased toxicity is traded for greater efficacy or vice versa .

In preferred embodiments expression of RNase 1 or variants e.g. recombinant expression is greater than 50 and preferably greater than 75 mg L. RNase 1 may be expressed in any suitable expression system. Bacterial and eukaryotic expression systems are available for production of recombinant proteins. In preferred embodiments proteins are expressed at high levels to aid in purification and to obtain large quantities of protein for animal studies clinical studies or therapeutic manufacture and sale. In some embodiments heterologous RNase 1 is expressed in vivo e.g. via transfected nucleic acid constructs provided by transplantation of engineered ex vivo cells gene therapy generation of transgenic animals etc. .

Preferred RNase 1 and variants thereof of the present invention exhibit tumor size reduction activity in animals. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless it is contemplated that one or more of several factors contribute to the activity of RNase 1 enzymes including but not limited to charge of the protein pore forming ability angiogenic effects proper dosing considerations etc.

Moreover as described above variant forms of human RNase 1 are also contemplated as being equivalent to those peptides and DNA molecules that are set forth in more detail herein. For example it is contemplated that isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate a threonine with a serine or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid i.e. conservative mutations will not have a major effect on the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Accordingly some embodiments of the present invention provide variants of human RNase 1 disclosed herein containing conservative replacements. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids can be divided into four families 1 acidic aspartate glutamate 2 basic lysine arginine histidine 3 nonpolar alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan and 4 uncharged polar glycine asparagine glutamine cysteine serine threonine tyrosine . Phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine are sometimes classified jointly as aromatic amino acids. In similar fashion the amino acid repertoire can be grouped as 1 acidic aspartate glutamate 2 basic lysine arginine histidine 3 aliphatic glycine alanine valine leucine isoleucine serine threonine with serine and threonine optionally be grouped separately as aliphatic hydroxyl 4 aromatic phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan 5 amide asparagine glutamine and 6 sulfur containing cysteine and methionine e.g. Stryer ed. pg. 17 21 2nd ed WH Freeman and Co. 1981 . Whether a change in the amino acid sequence of a peptide results in a functional polypeptide can be readily determined by assessing the ability of the variant peptide to function in a fashion similar to the wild type protein. Peptides having more than one replacement can readily be tested in the same manner.

More rarely a variant includes nonconservative changes e.g. replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan . Analogous minor variations can also include amino acid deletions or insertions or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be substituted inserted or deleted without abolishing biological activity can be found using computer programs including but not limited to FADE Mitchell et al. 2004 .

Variants may be produced by methods such as directed evolution or other techniques for producing combinatorial libraries of variants described in more detail below. In still other embodiments of the present invention the nucleotide sequences of the present invention may be engineered in order to alter a human RNase 1 coding sequence including but not limited to alterations that modify the cloning processing localization secretion and or expression of the gene product. For example mutations may be introduced using techniques that are well known in the art e.g. site directed mutagenesis to insert new restriction sites alter glycosylation patterns or change codon preference etc. . In some embodiments changes are made in the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention in order to optimize codon usage to the organism that the gene is expressed in.

Exemplary variants are described below including but not limited to substitutions truncations chimeras etc. The present invention is not limited to these particular variants. Both variants in the active site and substrate binding region and away from the active site are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. Variants may be selected based on for example experimental data computer modeling and by rational design by comparison to other ribonucleases. Activities may be tested using assay to select the variants with the desired properties see e.g. Raines et al. J. Biol. Chem 273 34134 1998 Fisher et al. Biochemistry 37 12121 1998 Guar et al. J. Biol. Chem. 276 24978 2001 Bosch et al. Biochemistry 43 2167 2004 Lin J. Biol. Chem. 245 6726 1970 Bal et al Eur. J. Biochem. 245 465 1997 Guar et al. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 275 95 2005 Benito et al.

Exemplary amino acid locations for modification in the production of variants are provided in . One or more sites may be modified as desired. Amino acid residues for human ribonucleases are provided in . The present invention provides a ranking of the utility for modification of each amino acid e.g. as represented by interest in modifying e.g. so as to result in a functional ribonuclease e.g. comprising a desired property e.g. cancer cell killing and or ribonucleolytic activity . The amino acids are labeled in as follows 

It will be appreciated that one or more modification sites may be used. Preferably the selected sites are high interest sites. However one or more medium interest or low interest sites may be used as desired and appropriate for the intended application. It should be noted that in some embodiments human RNase is produced e.g. in vitro in vivo or ex vivo in such a way that a methionine e.g. that is not part of wild type human RNase is incorporated as the first amino acid of the protein e.g. via the methods used to produce the protein e.g. recombinant human ribonuclease e.g. produced in . Thus in some embodiments the numbering of amino acid residues depicted in may be off by a numerical value of one e.g. if a methionine is incorporated into the protein then the numbering of the amino acid residues of the human RNases shown in is off by 1 i.e. because a methionine is incorporated in position 1 the numbering of the amino acids depicted in will be short by one e.g. the residue number 10 would actually be residue number 11 because of the methionine incorporated at position 1 . Similarly the positions depicted in may also be applied to corresponding numerical positions other related ribonucleases.

In some embodiments the desired residues for modification e.g. deletion mutation etc. in human ribonucleases e.g. hRNase 1 are selected to avoid disruption of the tertiary structure and or stability of the ribonuclease. In some embodiments these residues are on the surface of the protein e.g. residues generally exposed to solvent e.g. water or buffer . For example in some embodiments the types of residues that are modified include but are not limited to amino acids that appear disordered in crystal structures residues that contact the ribonuclease inhibitor protein and amino acids not involved in tertiary structures e.g. alpha helices and beta sheets amino acids in loop regions between structures e.g. alpha helices and beta sheets as well as amino acids towards the end of the protein the N and C termini . In some embodiments additional amino acid residues are added to either the N or C terminus e.g. to generate a RNase analogue and or for conjugation of a water soluble polymer .

Experiments conducted during the development of the present invention involved the formation of multiple variants of the human RNase 1. Such variants include changes of residues that have been described as binding sites for single and or double stranded RNA. The enzymatic activity of these variants is provided below. Despite the range in enzymatic activity displayed by each RNase 1 variant they were all active in xenograft models of non small cell lung cancer. Thus in addition to change made outside of the region attributed to enzyme activity change may also be made in the region.

The G38R R39D L86E N88R G89D R91D RNase 1 and L86E N88R G89D R91D RNase 1 displayed tumor growth inhibition in this model. Results are shown in and Table 2.

The R4C G38R R39D L86E N88R G89D R91DN118C RNase 1 variant impacted tumor growth in the xenograft model. Results are shown in and Table 3.

Despite having significantly lower enzymatic activity than the wild type RNase 1 the R4C K7A G38R R39D L86E N88R G89D R91DN118C RNase 1 variant demonstrated measurable tumor growth inhibition. Results are shown in and Table 4.

Thus the present invention provides a broad array of ribonucleases that find use in the methods and compositions of the invention. Indeed the examples above provide variants in the substrate and active sites that might have been expected to interfere with desired activities and properties of the protein. However empirical data demonstrated that these variants substantially retain desired activities and properties of wild type RNase 1.

In some embodiments RNase 1 or a variant thereof is delivered to a target cell using complementation. For example in some embodiments two or more fragments of RNase 1 are delivered separately to a cell. The fragments re associate to form a functional enzyme. In some embodiments two protein fragments are delivered. In other embodiments vectors comprising nucleic acids encoding fragments of RNase 1 are introduced into a cell or organism separately.

Suitable fragments for delivery by complementation may be determined by screening fragments e.g. in a cell culture assay for activity. Preferred fragments are those that rapidly re associate to form a functional enzyme. Enzyme activity can be determined using any suitable method including but not limited to those disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the present invention utilizes digestion of RNases to produce S peptide and S protein See e.g. Hamachi et al. Bioorg Med Chem Lett 9 1215 1218 1999 Goldberg and Baldwin Proc Natl Acad Sci 96 2019 2024 1999 Asai et al. J Immun Meth 299 63 76 2005 Backer et al. J Cont Release 89 499 511 2003 Backer et al. Bioconj Chem 15 1021 1029 2004 . For example digestion of bovine RNase A by subtilisin results primarily in two fragments due to cleavage between Ala20 and Ser21. The shorter fragment amino acids 1 20 is referred to as S peptide whereas the longer fragment amino acids 20 124 is referred to as S protein. The two fragments bind tightly at neutral pH and are sometime referred to as RNase S or RNase S . RNase S is an active ribonuclease. The S peptide S protein interaction has been used for affinity purification as well as in tertiary docking systems to target imaging agents or drugs. Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides S peptide S protein for human ribonucleases.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a composition comprising a plurality of human RNases e.g. hRNase1 . In some embodiments the plurality of RNases comprise monomers dimers trimers and or higher order complexes i.e. oligomers of hRNases.

In some preferred embodiments the RNase 1 or RNase 1 variants of the present invention are co administered with other medical interventions either simultaneously or sequentially. For example for cancer therapy any oncolytic agent that is routinely used in a cancer therapy may be co administered with the compositions and methods of the present invention. For example the U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains a formulary of oncolytic agents approved for use in the United States. International counterpart agencies to the U.S.F.D.A. maintain similar formularies. Table 5 provides a list of exemplary antineoplastic agents approved for use in the U.S. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the product labels required on all U.S. approved chemotherapeutics describe approved indications dosing information toxicity data and the like for the exemplary agents. It is contemplated that in some cases co administration with the compositions of the present invention permits lower doses of such compounds thereby reducing toxicity.

In other embodiments the RNase 1 compositions of the present invention are used in combination with variant human RNase proteins See e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 105 041 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety that are toxic to cells.

A current and still developing approach to cancer therapy involves using cancer cell specific reagents to target a malignant tumor although the proteins of the present invention may be used without targeting reagents. These toxic reagents can be produced by attaching a toxic payload to a cell specific delivery vector. Over the past few years a wide variety of tumor specific targeting proteins including antibodies antibody fragments and ligands for cell surface receptors have been developed and clinically tested. These targeting molecules have been conjugated to several classes of therapeutic toxins such as small molecule drugs enzymes radioisotopes protein toxins and other toxins for specific delivery to patients. While these efforts have made meaningful inroads to treat cancers significant challenges lie ahead to develop more effective toxins to create more robust and specific delivery systems and to design therapeutic proteins and protein vectors that avoid a detrimental immune response in humans.

Ribonuclease RNase proteins have been tested as human therapeutics because they have some selectivity for tumor cells this has been demonstrated most clearly with an RNase from early embryos. is a species of leopard frogs and its embryonic RNase is distantly related to the more highly conserved bovine and human pancreatic ribonucleases. In mammalian cells pancreatic type ribonucleases such as RNase A are secretory enzymes that catalyze the degradation of RNA to ribonucleotides and their activity is inhibited by binding to ribonuclease inhibitor RI a ubiquitous cytosolic protein. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless it is contemplated that ribonuclease inhibitor binds exceptionally tight to pancreatic type RNases abating their activity and thereby making them non toxic to normal or cancer cells. If the RNase activity is inhibited the cellular RNA is undamaged and the cell remains viable. In normal cells the ribonuclease activity is tightly controlled but if ribonuclease activity is uncontrolled the ribonucleolytic activity destroys cellular RNA and kills the cell. There are two main approaches to diminishing the binding of ribonucleases to the ribonuclease inhibitor protein. The first approach is to select a ribonuclease that is evolutionarily distant to humans and is not inhibited by human ribonuclease inhibitor protein. The frog ribonuclease when placed in a human cell is not strongly inhibited by RI and its RNase activity destroys cellular RNA and kills the target cell. This has been the approach with a specific RNase called Ranpirnase. Ranpirnase is generic name of the pharmaceutical that is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 559 212 and that is presently known by the registered trademark ONCONASE.

The second approach is to mutate mammalian ribonucleases so that they have diminished binding to the human ribonuclease inhibitor. These mutated enzymes provide high levels of ribonucleolytic activity within cancer cells because of disruption of binding to RI. This unregulated activity is particularly lethal to cancer cells. This mutation approach has been demonstrated with the mammalian proteins bovine RNase A and human RNase 1 and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 389 537 and 6 280 991 the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Surprisingly the present invention demonstrates that wild type human ribonuclease 1 and equivalent variants have the ability to kill cancer cells.

An ideal protein candidate for cancer therapy would be more toxic to tumor cells compared to non cancerous cells and would be targetable to a specific tumor. This candidate should have few side effects and should not stimulate a detrimental human immune response. Therapeutic proteins that elicit detrimental immune responses in humans are often problematic and sometimes unacceptable. Experiments conducted during the course of development of the present invention demonstrated that human RNase 1 exhibited significant anti tumor activity in mouse xenografts while exhibiting minimal toxicity. Accordingly in some embodiments the present invention provides RNase 1 proteins alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for use in killing cancer cells or degrading toxic RNA.

Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below. While the present invention is illustrated with human RNase 1 proteins the present invention is not limited to the use of RNase 1 of human origin. The present invention contemplates the use of homologs of RNase 1 from any organism and engineered proteins.

In some embodiments RNase 1 or a variant thereof is provided as a nucleic acid encoding the RNase. Introduction of molecules carrying genetic information into cells is achieved by any of various methods including but not limited to directed injection of naked DNA constructs bombardment with gold particles loaded with said constructs and macromolecule mediated gene transfer using for example liposomes biopolymers and the like. Preferred methods use gene delivery vehicles derived from viruses including but not limited to adenoviruses retroviruses vaccinia viruses and adeno associated viruses. Because of the higher efficiency as compared to retroviruses vectors derived from adenoviruses are the preferred gene delivery vehicles for transferring nucleic acid molecules into host cells in vivo. Adenoviral vectors have been shown to provide very efficient in vivo gene transfer into a variety of solid tumors in animal models and into human solid tumor xenografts in immune deficient mice. Examples of adenoviral vectors and methods for gene transfer are described in PCT publications WO 00 12738 and WO 00 09675 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 033 908 6 019 978 6 001 557 5 994 132 5 994 128 5 994 106 5 981 225 5 885 808 5 872 154 5 830 730 and 5 824 544 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Vectors may be administered to subject in a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments of the present invention vectors are administered into tumors or tissue associated with tumors using direct injection. In other embodiments administration is via the blood or lymphatic circulation See e.g. PCT publication 99 02685 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Exemplary dose levels of adenoviral vector are preferably 10to 10vector particles added to the perfusate.

Antibodies are glycoprotein molecules produced by white blood cells B lymphocytes of the immune system and their function is to recognize and bind to matter harmful to the organism. Once an antigen is marked by an antibody it is destroyed by other components of the immune system. A typical organism makes millions of different antibodies each designed to bind a specific epitope or antigenic determinant on the foreign antigen. Antibodies naturally combine specificity the ability to exquisitely discriminate diverse harmful molecules and affinity the ability to tightly lock onto those targets with the ability to recruit effector functions of the immune system such as antibody and complement mediated cytolysis and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC . Many new therapeutic approaches involving antibodies have succeeded in potentiating the natural antibody functions to treat or cure diseases.

Alternatively a toxic payload such as a radioactive element or a toxin attached to the antibody can be accurately delivered to the pathogenic target. The following table lists the mechanisms of some cancer therapeutic antibodies including three antibody conjugates that carry a toxic payload for lymphomas and leukemias. Drug Discovery Today Vol. 8 No. 11 Jun. 2003 . Two of the conjugates ZEVALIN and BEXXAR carry radioactive iodine as the toxin and the third MYLOTARG carries a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheaminin which is isolated from a bacterial fermentation. The Mylotarg antibody binds specifically to the CD33 antigen which is expressed on the surface of leukemic blasts that are found in more than 80 of patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML . The antibody in this conjugate has approximately 98.3 of its amino acid sequences derived from human origins.

Any of the targeting antibodies or agents used in these products may also be employed by the compositions and methods of the present invention.

Generally the most specific method for targeting toxins is the use of monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments that are designed to recognize surface antigens specific to tumor cells. Because normal cells lack the surface antigens they are not targeted and killed by the toxin conjugate. Whole antibodies have two domains a variable domain that gives the antibody its affinity and binding specificity and a constant domain that interacts with other portions of the immune system to stimulate immune responses in the host organism. The variable domain is composed of the complementarity determining regions CDRs which bind to the antibody s target and a framework region that anchors the CDRs to the rest of the antibody and helps maintain CDR shape. The six CDR s in each antibody differ in length and sequence between different antibodies and are mainly responsible for the specificity recognition and affinity binding of the antibodies to their target markers.

The functions of antibodies are reflected in their characteristic three dimensional structure which is ultimately determined by the primary sequence of amino acids and how those amino acids fold into a functional 3 dimensional protein chain. A step in developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is to simultaneously optimize biochemical and cellular functions for anti cancer performance and still keep the protein as humanlike as possible to minimize any anti antibody human immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies were originally produced in mice but when they are used in human therapeutic applications they present formidable obstacles. Mouse antibodies are recognized as foreign by the human immune system and thus they provoke the Human Anti Mouse Antibody or HAMA reaction. The HAMA reaction alters the mouse monoclonal effectiveness and can cause severe adverse symptoms in the recipient. Furthermore mouse antibodies are simply not as effective as human antibodies in mediating the human immune system to destroy the malignant cells. For these reasons it is often desired to design monoclonal antibodies that are as humanlike as possible but still maintain optimal biochemical immunological and therapeutic performance.

There are several factors that influence whether a therapeutic antibody will induce an immune response in the human host. These include the efficiency of uptake by an APC antigen presenting cell via pinocytosis receptor mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis. The efficiency of uptake is in turn influenced by the route of administration the solubility or aggregation of the protein its receptor binding specificity and whether the protein is recognized by class II major histocompatibility complex MHC molecules T cell receptors TCR and B cell receptors BCR . One of the most straightforward ways to evade the human immune response is to make the therapeutic protein sequence and structure as humanlike as possible.

Two main approaches have emerged to produce human or humanized therapeutic monoclonal antibodies either used alone as a therapeutic or as a carrier for a toxin. These include 1 humanizing mouse or other non human antibodies to make them compatible with the human immune system and 2 producing fully human antibodies in transgenic mice or by using genetic engineering methods in the laboratory. The processes have produced several categories of monoclonal antibodies. These include mouse chimaeric humanized and human antibodies. They are described briefly below 

The human antibodies produced by methods 4 5 and 6 are typically most desired because they produce a starting antibody that contains no mouse or otherwise foreign protein sequences that should stimulate an immune response in human patient. This approach in 4 5 and 6 also can bypass the challenge of substituting mouse CDR regions into human frameworks that often alters the 3 dimensional structure of the variable region thereby changing the antibody s binding and specificity. This approach in 4 5 6 successfully produced an anti CD3 antibody. The murine version elicited neutralizing antibodies after a single dose in all patients tested while a humanized version was only immunogenic in 25 of patients following multiple injections.

Besides making monoclonal antibodies as human like as possible in the primary sequence to escape the human immune response several other approaches make antibodies less immunogenic and more therapeutically effective are available. One approach is to covalently modify the antibody surface with reagents such as polyethylene glycol PEG to suppress its antigenicity and improve its solubility. These biochemical modifications also can have several other benefits such as reduced toxicity increased bioavailability and improved efficacy. Another approach is to use antibody fragments in which the potentially antigenic parts of the mouse antibody such as the constant region have been removed. This approach typically works only when the regulatory components within the antibody constant region are not required for therapeutic efficacy. Neither of these approaches has proven completely satisfactory which has driven the humanization effort to produce the ideal antibody candidate mentioned above.

In addition to antibody delivery vectors toxic molecules can be delivered to cancer cells using several other specific and non specific vectors including peptides polymers dendrimers liposomes polymeric nanoparticles and block copolymer micelles. For example peptides that bind to the leutinizing hormone releasing hormone have been used to target a small molecule toxin camptothecin to ovarian cancer cells Journal of Controlled Release 2003 91 61 73. .

Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. The administering physician can easily determine optimum dosages dosing methodologies and repetition rates.

In general dosage is from 0.01 g to 100 g per kg of body weight for example between 0.1 and 1000 mg per kg of body weight preferably between 0.1 and 500 mg kg of body weight and still more preferably between 0.1 and 200 mg kg of body weight for a period of between 1 and 240 minutes e.g. between 2 and 60 minutes and preferably between 15 and 45 minutes . Dosages may be administered as often as need to obtain the desired effect e.g. reduction of tumor size or number of cancerous cells for example once or more daily to once or more weekly or monthly. In some embodiments the compositions are administered weekly at a dose of between 0.1 and 10 mg e.g. 1 mg for a period of between 5 and 60 minutes e.g. 30 minutes . The treating physician can estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment it may be desirable to have the subject undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state once or more daily to once every 20 years. In some preferred embodiments dosages are 0.25 1000 mg kg daily weekly or monthly to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In some preferred embodiments dosages are 50 mcg mto 400 mcg mdaily weekly or monthly to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

The enzymatic activity of the wild type human RNase 1 was determined using a fluorescent assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET . The substrate for the assay 5 FAM ArUAA 3 TAMRA IDT is not fluorescent until cleaved.

In a typical assay the buffer 160 microliters of 100 mM NaCl 100 mM Tris pH 7.0 100 microgram mL BSA is added to the wells of a 96 well non binding surface black polystyrene plate. The RNase typically 10 microliters of an approximately 2 10M solution is also added. Substrate 30 microliters of a 1.33 micromolar solution of 5 FAM ArUAA 3 TAMRA is then added to each well and the samples mixed. The plate is read on a fluorescent plate reader immediately.

Control wells are included for F0 no enzyme and Fmax determinations typically 10 microliters of a 0.1 mg mL solution of RNase A per 200 microliter assay . In this example wild type human RNase 1 had a k K 2.65 10Msec. The results are shown in .

Sixteen CD 1 mice 5 weeks old Harlan were injected with 75 mg per kg of body weight of wild type human RNase 1. Blood was collected from three mice at each of the following time points 0.5 1.0 1.5 2 4 6 8 24 36 48 hours. The animals were rotated for bleeding leaving as much time as possible between bleeding times. The blood was allowed to clot for several hours at 4 C. and spun in a microfuge at top speed for 10 minutes. The serum was then collected and stored at 20 C.

The serum samples for each timepoint were pooled and the serum diluted 1 10 000 . The enzymatic activity assay described in the previous example was used to analyze the samples. The slope of the line for each time point was plotted and is provided .

Cells from a non small cell lung cancer cell line A549 were grown in nine T175 flasks in F12K media and 10 fetal calf serum until the cells were confluent. 4.5 10cells in 100 microliters were injected into the right rear flank of 4 5 week old male homozygous nu nu nude mice Harlan Madison Wis. . Tumors were allowed to grow to an average size of 75 mmbefore treatments were initiated. Animals of each tumor type with the properly sized tumors were divided into treatment groups including one set of animals treated weekly with vehicle phosphate buffered saline PBS . The vehicle and the test agents were all administered by intraperitoneal injection. Each animal was weighed twice a week during treatment. The tumors were measured twice weekly using calipers. Tumor volume mm was determined by using the formula for an ellipsoid sphere 

This xenograft model was set up as in the previous example except that a human prostate cancer cell line DU145 was used. The efficacy of wild type human RNase 1 is shown relative to docetaxel. The RNase 1 was administered at 75 mg per kg of body weight of the animal 75 mg kg 1 wk while the docetaxel was used at 8 mg kg once a week. The value of n represents the number of animals in the specific treatment arm of the experiment. Results are shown in and Table 8.

Clinical chemistry and a complete blood count CBC plus platelets were performed on whole blood and serum samples collected from the mice 24 hours after the last treatment of the prostate xenograft model above. In all tests the results for wild type human RNase 1 and docetaxel were determined not to be significantly different from the vehicle treated animals Mann Whitney U test . Creatinine was also tested and found not to differ. The levels of the liver enzymes gamma glutamyl transferase GGT and alanine transaminase ALT in all treatment groups were similar GGT data not shown. . Results are shown in . The values were determined for the various treatment groups of the prostate DU145 xenograft study for clinical chemistry A. B. complete blood count C. D. and platelets F. .
