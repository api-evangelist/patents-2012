In the description herein with respect to the drawings any reference to direction is purely informative and is employed for ease of reference. It is not intended as limiting the scope of the claims herein.

The deflection plate or anchor arm plate of the present invention is for use in the M16 Heavy Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle manufactured by Barnes and Reinecke in the late 1970 s and the M18 Medium Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle manufactured also by Barnes and Reinecke in the late 1980 s . These vehicles are designed for testing power drawbar effect and resistance to towing characteristics of tracked and wheeled vehicles.

Referring to there is shown one preferred embodiment of a high strength deflection plate according to the present invention. The deflection plate as shown generally in and is a 100 000 pound referred to here as 100 kip embodiment which has a generally rectangular configuration having a flat back surface and a front surface as shown in which is not flat along its entire length from top to bottom. The top surface and the bottom surface of the deflection place are also preferably flat. Generally the front surface is tapered such that the front surface adjacent the top surface is thicker than the front surface adjacent the bottom surface .

The deflection plate as shown in and also in is formed of preferably five segments of varying thickness and shape. As shown in these are segments and . Segments and have flat front surfaces and respectively. Segments and have tapered front surfaces and respectively. Generally each of these tapered segments has decreasing cross sectional thicknesses toward the bottom segment which has the smallest cross sectional thickness. Hence segment has the largest thickness and segment has the smallest thickness. The deflection plate has a right side wall and a left side wall which are preferably flat. Segment has bottom inwardly tapered flat wall portions and as shown in and .

Segment has four similar bores as shown in and to receive suitably dimensioned and configured similar bolts as shown for example in . Segment has a single bore to receive a single suitably dimensioned and configured bolt that is preferably larger in cross section than bolts .

Referring now to and there is shown an alternative preferred embodiment of a deflection plate also according to the present invention. The deflection plate is a 75 kip 75 000 pound embodiment which has generally like configuration as does deflection plate . However the 75 kip embodiment 100 has different tapered segments and different sizes and dimensions than those of the 100 kip embodiment 10.

A comparison of these tapered segments and dimensions for the deletion plates and are shown in . For example in deflection plate segment has a thickness of about 3.85 inches. Segment of deflection plate has a thickness of about 3.34 inches. In general deflection plate has smaller dimensions than deflection plate . But both have the same height of about 17.5 inches and a width of about 6.00 inches so that they can each be bolted in place to the same surrounding structural components of the undercarriage of the Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle as shown in . More detailed dimensions of a preferred embodiment for deflection plate are shown in A and B and for deflection plate are shown in A and B.

The deflection plate also has a generally rectangular configuration having a flat back surface and a front surface as shown in which is not flat along its entire length from top to bottom. The top surface and the bottom surface of the deflection place are preferably flat. As was the case with deflection plate deflection plate similarly has a front surface that is tapered such that the front surface adjacent the top surface is thicker than the front surface adjacent the bottom surface .

The deflection plate as shown in and also in is formed of preferably five segments of varying thickness and shape. As shown in these are segments and . Segments and have flat front surfaces and respectively. Segments and have tapered front surfaces and respectively. Generally each of these tapered segments has decreasing cross sections thicknesses toward the bottom segment which has the smallest cross sectional thickness. Hence segment has the largest thickness and segment has the smallest thickness. The deflection plate has a right side wall and a left side wall which are preferably flat. Segment has bottom inwardly tapered flat wall portions and as shown in and .

Segment has four similar bores as shown in and to receive suitably dimensioned and configured similar bolts not shown which are comparable to bolts shown for example in . Segment has a single bore to receive a single suitably dimensioned and configured bolt not shown that is preferably larger in cross section than the bolts for bores and is comparable to bolt also shown in .

Referring now to the embodiment shown in the deflection plate is mounted to a lower support plate that includes an L shaped member having a horizontal portion and a vertical portion . As shown in the deflection plate is positioned between a front bushing or restraining plate and a rear bushing or restraining plate which is sandwiched between back surface and the front surface of the vertical portion of the L shaped member of lower support plate . An upper support plate is positioned against the back surface of the vertical portion . These components are fastened together with the bolts that extend through comparably sized and aligned holes not shown in each of these components and also bores of deflection plate . The ends of the bolts extend past the back surface of the upper support plate . The holes of at least upper support plate can have grooves to receive the grooves on the bolts so as to fasten these components together with the deflection plate .

The upper support plate can preferably be attached to a horizontal plate and a transverse plate as shown in . These plates collectively form a nut fixture to received and secure the bolts . A semi ring can be affixed to the upper surface of horizontal plate .

As shown in a load cell is mounted to the deflection plate through a front clevis into which is positioned a front eye bolt extending from the front of the load cell . A front mounting bolt couples the front eye bolt to the front clevis . The front mounting bolt is kept in place by two cross pins and corresponding catch rings on opposite ends of the front mounting bolt as shown in . The bolt is secured to the clevis which has a bore not shown to receive the bolt . A bushing is positioned between bolt and the front surface of deflection plate .

The load cell also has a rear eye bolt or ball joint rod end extending from the front of the load cell as shown in . Threaded adapters positioned on each side of the load cell are used in coupling the load cell to the clevis and the rear eye bolt . The rear eye bolt is configured to receive a rear mounting bolt . In this manner the load cell can be coupled to a sway bar or load beam as shown in . The sway bar or load beam has a clevis which allows for coupling the rear eye bolt by the rear mounting bolt . The cross pins and corresponding catch rings help to maintain the rear mounting bolt in place. A rocker arm is coupled to the clevis with a retaining bolt . The load beam is coupled at it rearward portion to a towbar cross member which is part of the tow mechanism shown in . These latter drawings demonstrate a US Army mobile Dynamometer hooked up to and towing a Stryker vehicle .

Referring now to the sway bar or load beam includes a stopper plate which is positioned between a front stop member and a rear stop member . Both the front stop member and rear stop member are coupled or mounted on support members and respectively as shown in and which are mounted to the undercarriage of mobile Dynamometer . As shown in the stopper plate during the towing and testing operation can be spaced from the front stop member and the rear stop member .

The high strength deflection plates and are designed such that they will not yield under the design force but can deflect preferably 0.25 inches at the 100 000 pound capacity of the load cell . At this point the sway bar or load beam can hit a mechanical stopper directly attached to the frame or undercarriage of the mobile dynamometer . In this manner the load cell is allowed to measure the towing force up to but not exceeding about 100 000 pounds. As noted above the deflection plates and are tapered such that the stress remains approximately constant throughout most of the entire plate. This allows the maximum deflection possible since there is no unnecessary material. In one preferred embodiment the material for high strength and low modulus of elasticity can be Aluminum 7075 T651.

As shown in the deflection plates are designed to generally have a safety factor S.F. between 1.1 and 1.2 in at least the upper four segments and of deflection plate and the upper four segments and of deflection plate . The safety factor is the yield strength shown as sigma in psi in divided by the design stress. In the topmost horizontal broken line shows a S.F. of 1.0. The next lower horizontal broken line represents a S.F. of 1.1 while the next lower horizontal broken line represents a S.F. of 1.2 as also indicated in the legend boxes in . The larger the safety factor the less likely the part will fail. The yield strength of aluminum 7075 is about 73 000 psi. For example a safety factor of 2 would be a design stress of 73 000 2 36 500 psi. In this case the S.F. 1.1 corresponds to a design stress of 66 364 psi and the S.F. 1.2 corresponds to a design stress of 60 833 psi.

The design criteria which determine the thickness of the material and points of slope change of preferred embodiments of deflection plates and was for the stress generally throughout the part to be between a S.F. of 1.2 and 1.1 and all times. If the safety factor dropped below 1.1 the part would be in danger of failing and if the safety factor was greater than 1.2 there is more material than needed.

In the thicknesses of deflection plates and are shown in relative relation to the safety factors determined along the various segments of the deflection plates and . However the full vertical heights or lengths of the deflection plates are not shown. Basically as can be seen from the x axis in starts at the single main bolt hole and at the left. For deflection plate from x 0 to x 1.25 the thickness is 1.4 . At x 1.25 the slope changes and at x 2 the thickness is 1.78 . At x 4.1. the thickness is 2.55 . At x 9.31 the thickness is 3.85 . Finally at 9.81 the thickness remains 3.85 and the graphs in end. That is the point where the front bushing or restraining plate begins as shown in .

Although a load cell can be employed as described above in a Mobile Dynamometer load cells are not always available and they are not cost effective to directly measure the vehicle weights on a bridge by using load cells. However strain gages can be employed to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on slender beams using strain gage based methods with application to portable Army bridges.

According to this aspect of the present invention unique strain gage based methods were developed to identify magnitudes and locations of loads on a non continuous non homogenous slender beam with variable cross sections welded and bolted joints and pinned firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions. Four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam created a force transducer capable of identifying the magnitude and location of a load inside the weight area. By combining individually scaled strain gage outputs the bending moment diagram was constructed. For the case of multiple loads separated by two or more strain gage locations uniaxial strain gages forming multiple force transducers can still identify the magnitudes and locations of all the loads. A calibration method was developed to account for the discrepancies between the theoretical and actual scaling factors arising from stress concentrations and unpredictable stress patterns in the beams due to the presence of the joints. The strain gage based force transducer methodology was experimentally validated on prismatic beams with firm rest soft rest firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions an aluminum beam with a bolted joint and a half aluminum and half steel beam with two different cross sections and a bolted joint. It was also experimentally validated on a continuous aluminum beam with a linearly varying cross section and rest boundary conditions a tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints and a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The force transducer methodology is independent of the boundary conditions of the beam and the error from strain gage drift due to uniform thermal expansion on a prismatic beam can cancel out.

When there are multiple loads separated by only one strain gage location the problem is posed for the force transducer methodology. Another method has been developed using two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam one on each side of a load to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load can be used to identify the location of the load. The strain gage based methods were experimentally validated on a prismatic beam with rest boundary conditions.

Load identification on large scale bridges has many applications in both the public and military sectors. The Bridge Crossing Simulator BCS which is operated by the US Army Aberdeen Test Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland USA tests portable army bridges for fatigue failure by simulating thousands of vehicle crossings. The current methodology involves setting up a bridge on dirt abutments and measuring strains from the bridge that are collected from vehicles with various crossing speeds . Next the bridge is set up on the BCS with wood abutments and straps and hydraulic cylinders are used to apply loads to the bridge through multiple load application devices referred to as Whiffles . The strain time history is used in a control system feedback loop for each corresponding cylinder in order to simulate various crossing speeds of vehicles on the bridge. This method can be subject to uncertainties since the actual vehicle loads are not known from the field data. A new load identification methodology can be used to identify cylinder loads that need to be applied from measured strains from live crossings of vehicles.

A load identification methodology can also be used to determine the life span of a commercial bridge given the strain gage data of vehicles that cross it 1 Numbers within brackets refer to the References listed beginning at page 96 . The frequency and the weights of vehicles that cross a bridge are often an estimated quantity by structural designers. Load cells are not always available and it is not cost effective to directly measure the vehicle weights using load cells 2 . By developing a measurement technique using strain gages one can identify specific axle loads of a vehicle without using a scale 3 . Previous methods transform a bridge into a dynamic scale when multiple vehicles were crossing it 1 9 . This is primarily an inverse problem since the loads are unknown but the response is known 10 .

By measuring strain at one location the system AXWAY in Ref. 4 develops an influence line by summing the individual strain curves from known vehicle axle weights and performing a best fit analysis. The influence line is dependent on vehicle speed axle spacing axle weights and gross vehicle weight 4 . A limitation of this method is that a bridge can only have one vehicle on it at a time. Deflection measurements can also be used where the dynamic beam response is calculated 11 . According to the previous studies the load identification method using deflection data is more prone to error than that using bending moment data 5 . Another approach involves modeling a vehicle bridge system and using acceleration measurements to calculate the dynamic response of the system 6 . However when comparing the strain model to the acceleration model lower error was obtained from the strain model 12 . A limitation of deflection based methods and acceleration based methods is that the boundary conditions must be accurately known.

A Reaction Force Detection RFD system to detect lameness in cows was developed by measuring four reaction forces on a plate using load cells 13 . Calibration is performed along with statistical methods to determine when forces are reduced in a limb of a lame cow. When a single limb is on a plate the RFD calculates the magnitude and position of the force. A limitation of the method is that when multiple limbs are on the plate the RFD calculates the magnitude and position of the resultant force and cannot decipher individual forces.

A transducer converts one form of energy to another 14 . The interest here is to convert mechanical energy to an electrical signal that represents the load applied. Components of a force transducer include an applied load the spring response strain gages and a Wheatstone bridge circuit as shown in illustration courtesy of Vishay Measurements 15 17 . Strain gages are useful when stress measurements are desired since stress cannot be directly measured but strain can be measured 16 . Strain is defined as the change in length over original length and does not Shave units 16 . A strain gage consists of a continuous wire that is bonded to a material for measurement through a rigorous application procedure with a uniaxial strain gage that measures strain in one direction shown in illustration courtesy of Vishay Measurements 17 . When the material deforms each leg of the wire also deforms. The wire changes its cross section and more importantly electrical resistance. When the strain gage is connected to a Wheatstone bridge the voltage amplifies the resistance change which can be converted to a strain measurement. Typical strain measurements are very small and reported in microstrain . One is defined as one unit of deformation per 1 000 000 units of original length 14 . Even though strain is unitless the precision of the measurement is high since for a strain gage with an active strain gage length of 6.35 millimeters one is a deformation of 6.35 nanometers. Strain gages are a useful measurement technique for most metal structures such as aluminum and steel. Because of the porous nature of concrete it is difficult to correctly bond a strain gage. However it is possible to measure strains on large scale concrete bridges by mounting aluminum members to concrete and applying strain gages to the aluminum members 10 .

A general challenge of an inverse problem is that it is often ill posed 8 . Given measurement quantities can often lead to multiple solutions for input loads 18 . Hence a final design of a force transducer should be robust enough to pinpoint a unique solution. It has been shown multiple times that a structure itself can be turned into a force transducer using strain measurements 4 5 10 . A general formulation is given by Masroor and Zachary 19 1.1 where is a u 1 matrix that represents measured strains at candidate locations P is a v 1 matrix that represents independent input forces and A is a u v coefficient matrix that depends on the geometric and material properties. The coefficient matrix is determined experimentally through known inputs P and outputs . The inverse problem associated with Eq. 1.1 can be solved 1.2 where A is the generalized inverse of A . The challenge of properly setting up this method is to first determine appropriate strain and load locations so that Eq. 1.2 is well posed since not all locations can provide independent information. 1.3 New Methods

Novel strain gage based methods are developed to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on beams.

Chapter 2 Identifying the Magnitude and Location of a Load on a Slender Beam Using a Strain Gage Based Force Transducer

A unique strain gage based method is developed to identify the magnitude and location of a load on a slender beam with non homogeneous material variable cross sections and pinned firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions. Four uniaxial strain gages are mounted to the bottom surface of the beam and the bending moment diagram of the beam can be constructed using measured strains on the beam. By combining individually scaled strain gage outputs the magnitude and location of the load can be accurately identified. The strain gage based force transducer methodology is experimentally validated on prismatic beams with firm rest soft rest firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions and a continuously tapered beam with rest boundary conditions. The force transducer methodology is independent of the boundary conditions of the beam and the error from strain gage drift due to uniform thermal expansion on a prismatic beam can cancel out.

A strain gage based force transducer has been used to identify the magnitude of a force F on a slender cantilever beam 20 as shown in . Two uniaxial strain gages which measure strains along the x direction are located between the load and the fixed boundary as shown in . For an Euler Bernoulli beam the relationship between the shear force V and the bending moment M is 21 

Consider a beam with non homogeneous material variable cross sections and pinned boundary conditions. While a strain gage based force transducer for the cantilever beam has only two strain gages that for a beam with reaction forces at two boundaries has four strain gages with two strain gages on each side of a load to calculate the slopes of the bending moment curves on the two sides of the load. The free body diagram shown in has a force Flocated inside a designated weight area between strain gages and where Rand Rare the reaction forces at the two boundaries in this work the index n for a force Fdenotes the force is located to the right of strain gage where n 1 2 3 4 is the strain gage number. The standard sign conventions for the shear force and bending moment diagrams are used 21 . The left shear force curve in has a constant value R and the right shear force curve has a constant value R. Since a bending moment curve is the integral of a shear force curve the slope of the left bending moment curve is R and that of the right bending moment curve is R as shown in . Subtracting the latter from the former and using the force equilibrium equation and Eq. 2.1 yield Slope Slope 2.7 

The last possibility is for a force located outside the weight area but inside the force transducer i.e. the force is between strain gages and or between strain gages and shows the case when the force is between strain gages and . The strain measurements lead to a partially correct measured bending moment diagram as shown in . Let

For the case of a homogenous prismatic beam with unequal strain gage spacing where is the global scaling factor for all the strain gages and Eq. 2.11 becomes

It should be noted that a beam can have many strain gages and the four strain gages of a force transducer do not have to be adjacent to each other for Eq. 2.11 . Any combination of strain gages and can form a force transducer 

The methodology developed in this work is also applicable to a distributed load within the weight area as shown in where a uniformly distributed force w is applied over a length d. The shear force diagram in shows that the slope of the shear force curve over the length dis equal to the distributed force w. The drop in the shear force curves across the distributed force is equal to the resultant force F wd which is the same as that for the case of a concentrated force F as shown in . The comparison of the bending moment diagrams for the concentrated force and the distributed force whose centroid is located at the same position as the concentrated force is shown in . It can be seen from that the intersection of the left and right bending moment curves is the position of the concentrated force F and it is also the position of the centroid of the distributed force w as shown in . This concept can be extended to a distributed load of any shape. A distributed load outside the force transducer can be treated as the case in and a distributed load between strain gages and or between strain gages and can be treated as the case in . A distributed load that crosses a strain gage boundary is in effect a multiple load problem which is beyond the scope of the current chapter and will be discussed in Chapter 3. Finally a combination of concentrated and distributed loads follows the same methodology as that for a single load case as long as they do not cross a strain gage boundary.

Let dand dbe the distances between the force F and the left and right boundaries respectively as shown in . There are two types of a rest boundary condition a firm rest boundary condition where the reaction force acts at the edge of a firm abutment and a soft rest boundary condition 24 where the reaction force is distributed over a soft abutment which can be represented by a concentrated reaction force at the edge of the abutment and a reaction moment . The distances between the left and right reaction forces Rand R and the edges of the soft abutments are dand d respectively and the lengths of the beam sitting on the left and right soft abutments are Dand D respectively . In this study a firm rest boundary is similar to a pinned boundary and a soft rest boundary is similar to a fixed boundary except that the direction of the reaction moment for the soft rest boundary is opposite to that of the fixed boundary and the slope of a fixed boundary is zero while that of a soft rest boundary may not be zero. With a positive external force in the upward direction and a positive external moment in the counterclockwise direction the reaction forces and moments for pinned firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions are shown in Table 2.1 where a statically indeterminate analysis for the pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions is used 25 .

The shear force diagrams for the firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions are the same as that for the pinned boundary conditions in . Similarly the slopes of the left and right bending moment curves are still Rand R respectively as shown in . Positive and negative strains are expected at the bottom surfaces of the beams near the soft rest and fixed boundaries due to the positive and negative bending moments there respectively. The sum of the reaction forces Rand Rwill always equal the applied force as shown in Table 2.1 hence Eqs. 2.7 through 2.18 still apply regardless of the boundary conditions. While inaccurate boundary conditions can create a discrepancy in the strains the magnitude of the load can still be accurately calculated.

When a force is located inside a weight area the position of the force can be identified using the strain gage readings. Since the position of the intersection point of the left and right bending moment curves in corresponds to the position of the force the relative position of the force Fcan be calculated by simultaneously solving the equations for the left and right bending moment curves 

Similarly the location of a load on a cantilever beam in can be identified. Let dbe the distance between the strain gage at point a to the fixed boundary. The absolute position of the force F measured from the fixed end is

It is known that strain gages will drift when temperature changes within the material 14 . In fact this is typically the main cause for error when dealing with strain gages 26 . For an outdoor setup the ambient temperature can change over 10 C. throughout the course of the day. Depending on the material this can cause a change of 1 C. or more for the actual material temperature through convection. Aluminum 6061 T6 has a coefficient of thermal expansion of 23.6 C. Hence a 1 C. shift in temperature of the material can introduce a 23.6 drift in all the strain gages simultaneously. If this happens the force transducer will still respond correctly. When combining four strain gages in a typical strain gage based transducer in a Wheatstone bridge or mathematically the temperature effects can cancel out when uniform strain gage drift occurs 27 . For the force transducer in Eq. 2.11 when and the same shift in all four strain gages cancels out. Non uniform thermal expansion often occurs when the sun causes a part of a structure to expand more than some other part due to radiation. For non uniform thermal expansion or when and are not satisfied such as the case of a non homogeneous and or non prismatic beam error can be eliminated by zeroing strain gages before readings are taken.

One of the inherent features of the force transducer methodology is that it possesses an absolute error instead of a relative error for the strain gages which is due to the accuracy of the equipment and the sensitivity of measurements. For example each strain gage is accurate to within 2 to 3 regardless of whether it is reading 5 or 500 . It is recommended to use optimal strain readings between 1 000 and 1 500 when designing a force transducer to increase the signal to noise ratio 15 . A method to increase the output signal is to introduce local notching near a strain gage 28 .

As with any transducer design calibration is expected and plays a vital role in developing a methodology 29 . The geometric and material properties can deviate from theoretical values. In the case of extreme temperatures the Young s Modulus can change by 1 to 3 14 . An accepted calibration method for an over determined problem is to minimize the least squares error between the experimental and calculated magnitudes of loads 8 . Another accepted method is to reduce the maximum error.

The calibration procedure is set up so that a single known nonzero force F where n 2 3 . . . N 1 is placed between strain gages and which is inside the weight area of the force transducer FTthat consists of strain gages through and all the other forces on the beam are zero all the strains are recorded . There are N 3 strain gages on the beam that create N force transducers each of which consists of four adjacent strain gages in order to identify the magnitudes of the N nonzero forces. Equations 2.11 and 2.12 are modified to reflect the N force transducers created 

For each applied force F the N force transducers FT n 2 3 . . . N 1 each involving four scaling factors through are used. It should be noted that the goal of the force transducer here is not only to identify a load inside the weight area but also to identify a zero load outside the force transducer. Hence both the loaded and unloaded zones are used in calibration. All the force transducers used except FT are expected to read zero. The force transducer FTand FTare not used because the force Fis outside their weight areas but inside the force transducers which can only provide a partial response. The calibration equation is 2.26 where F is a q 1 matrix in which q N 2N 2 that represents all the known forces is a q m matrix in which m N 3 that represents the measured strains from strain gages forming the force transducers and is an m 1 matrix that represents the scaling factors. An example of Eq. 2.26 for N S is

For the case of a single force transducer on a homogenous prismatic beam the magnitude of one known force inside the weight area is needed to determine the global scaling factor in Eq. 2.16 as shown in Sec. 2.3.1. For the case of multiple force transducers on the beam the above calibration procedure can also be used to determine with in Eq. 2.26 replaced by . Alternatively one force transducer on the beam can be used to determine with a known force and the same scaling factor can be used in another force transducer to calculate an unknown force as shown in Sec. 2.3.2. When the strain gages are equally spaced in Eq. 2.26 can be replaced by .

A quantity of four uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 06 250UN 350 were bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of a steel A36 beam with rest boundary conditions where the supports for the beam were made of aluminum as shown in . It should be noted that the blocks on the end abutments are only a guide for the beam and does not create fixed boundary conditions as shown in . The weight was applied via dumbbells supported by a thin string to accurately apply a force at a given position as shown in . The nominal weight of the dumbbells was used whose weights were within 1.2 of their nominal values. The weight was moved to different positions inside the weight area. A Vishay P3 strain indicator and a Vishay SB 10 switch unit were used to display the strain gage outputs. Since strain is directly proportional to the Young s modulus and steel is three times stiffer than aluminum the strain readings will be one third the values from a comparable aluminum beam. The theoretical Young s modulus for aluminum is 69 GPa and that for steel is 200 GPa. Unlike the design range of an aluminum beam force transducer which is between 1 000 to 1 500 that of a steel beam force transducer is between 300 to 500 which can reduce the signal to noise ratio. The cross section of the steel beam is 19.1 mm by 25.4 mm and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in .

The errors for the uncalibrated magnitude of the force were within 2.2 . Since there is one force transducer on a homogeneous prismatic beam there is one global scaling factor . A known force F 445 N at 0.5 was used to determine in Eq. 2.16 . The errors for the calibrated magnitudes of all the unknown forces were within 0.6 . The position errors for all the forces were within 0.1 as shown in Table 2.2. The adjusted global scaling factor was 102 of the theoretical global scaling factor. The bending moment diagram was also calculated using measured strains and compared with the theoretical bending moment diagram for the firm rest boundary conditions as shown in .

While the four strain gages in demonstrated the application of a single force transducer the beam in was also used for multiple force transducers where 12 strain gages were bonded along the bottom surface of the beam as shown in . The adjusted global scaling factor from the single force transducer in was used with calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces shown in Table 2.3. The position of a force is the strain gage number n directly to the left of the force added to the corresponding . The maximum force error was 3.7 the maximum zero error was 5.1 and the maximum position error was 0.6 . The bending moment diagram for a 445 N force at position 8.5 was calculated using measured strains and compared with the theoretical bending moment diagram for the firm rest boundary conditions as shown in .

A quantity of twelve uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 13 250UN 350 were bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of an aluminum 6061 T6 beam as shown in where multiple dumbbells created a distributed load on the beam. The cross section of the beam is 12.7 mm by 305 mm and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in . A known force F 445 N at 0.5 was used to determine the global calibration factor which was 97.5 of its theoretical value. A distributed load was placed within the weight area of FT with the results shown in Table 2.4. The magnitude and position of the resultant force were calculated from the magnitudes and positions of forces F F and F . The force errors were within 0.8 and the position errors were within 2.3 . The bending moment diagram was calculated using measured strains and compared with the theoretical bending moment diagram for firm rest boundary conditions for a 1 557 N distributed force at the center of the beam as shown in .

A quantity of six uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 13 250UN 350 were bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of an aluminum 6061 T6 beam as shown in where the fixed boundary conditions were approximated by bolted clamps . A dumbbell was directly placed on the beam. While the deformation of the beam can cause the load to be distributed over a small area it has been shown in Sec. 2.2.1 that the magnitude of a distributed load within a weight area can be calculated using the same methodology as that for a concentrated load. The cross section of the aluminum beam is 3.2 mm by 40 mm and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in . The force transducer FTwas not used because the load was outside the weight area but inside the force transducer.

The beam with firm rest and soft rest boundary conditions is shown in respectively where sponges were used to simulate the soft rest boundaries. The bending moment diagram was calculated using measured strains and compared with the theoretical bending moment diagram for the firm rest boundary conditions as shown in . The accuracy of the experimental firm rest boundary conditions can be quantitatively determined from the equations of the calculated left and right bending moment curves. The equations for the curves are determined by adding trend lines to the calculated bending moments using Microsoft Excel with a reported coefficient of determination R where R 1 indicates a perfect correlation to a line. The equation of the left bending moment curve is M Rx M where M 0 for a firm rest boundary and that of the right bending moment curve is M Rx b where b RL for a firm rest boundary. The equations of the two bending moment curves can be used to calculate the reaction moments Mand Min which can show whether a rest boundary was a firm rest boundary or a soft rest boundary. The left reaction moment is determined by setting x 0 for the left trend line equation and the right reaction moment is determined by setting x L for the right trend line equation. The calculated left and right reaction moments are 0.009 Nm and 0.006 Nm respectively which are within 0.4 of the largest bending moment value. The calculated dfrom is 0.6 mm consequently d D 0.8 . The calculated dis 0.8 mm consequently d D 1.0 . The discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated bending moments near a boundary indicate that either the boundary was not an ideal boundary or there was a measurement error. Given that the calculated dand dwere negative the latter was most likely the case. Since the absolute values of d Dand d Dwere within 1 the rest boundaries were indeed firm rest boundaries which can also be seen from where the beam contacted the aluminum supports at their edges. Similarly the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the soft rest boundary conditions are shown in where evenly distributed reaction forces were assumed for the theoretical bending moment diagram with d D d D 50 . The calculated left reaction moment is 0.537 Nm compared with the theoretical value of 0.569 Nm from Table 2.1. The calculated right reaction moment is 0.278 Nm compared with the theoretical value of 0.319 Nm from Table 2.1. The calculated d D and d Dare 46 and 44 respectively which are close to the theoretical values of 50 . A triangular distributed reaction force with a maximum value at the edge of an abutment would give d D d D 33.3 the experimental boundary conditions were closer to evenly distributed reaction forces.

The experimental setup for the firm rest fixed boundary conditions are shown in . Comparisons of the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions are shown in respectively. The bolted clamps for the fixed boundaries were designed to be much larger than the test beam negative strains were observed near the fixed boundaries as expected. The calculated left reaction moment for the firm rest fixed beam in is 0.04 Nm which is 0.9 of the largest bending moment value and the calculated right reaction moment is 1.89 Nm which is 9.1 lower in magnitude than the reaction moment of the fixed boundary 2.08 Nm from Table 2.1 . The calculated left reaction moment for the fixed beam in is 2.70 Nm compared to 2.97 Nm for the left fixed boundary from Table 2.1 and the calculated right reaction moment is 1.43 Nm compared to 1.49 Nm for the right fixed boundary from Table 2.1. The discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated reaction moments in indicate that the bolted clamps did not completely apply the theoretical reaction moments. While the errors between the theoretical and calculated bending moments are not directly related to those between the theoretical and calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces they would affect the accuracy in determining the reaction moments at the boundaries.

The scaling factors for firm rest soft rest firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions were determined by applying a known force Fat position 4.5 and used to calculate the unknown force Fat position 2.5. While the scaling factors for the four types of boundary conditions were determined separately for each type of boundary conditions they were within a tight range of 88.4 to 90.7 of the theoretical showing that the geometric and material properties are independent of the boundary conditions. The calculated magnitudes and positions of the unknown forces are shown in Table 2.5. The errors for the magnitudes of the forces were within 2.3 when the force was inside the weight area of the force transducer FT. When the force was outside the force transducer FT the force transducer output should read zero and the zero errors were within 2.5 . The position errors were within 2.3 .

A continuously tapered aluminum 6061 T6 beam with rest boundary conditions is shown in . The beam has a taper angle of 5 and a width of 25.4 mm as shown in . A quantity of 12 uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 13 250UN 350 were bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of the beam and the strain gage locations are shown in . The hexadecimal numbering system is used where the force transducer formed by strain gages through is FTOr FT. Equation 2.11 was used to calculate the theoretical scaling factor for each strain gage at different positions which have different cross sections.

The calibration procedure in Sec. 2.2.3 was used where a known force of 845 N was applied inside the weight areas of all nine possible force transducers. An unknown force of 1 201 N was then applied inside all the weight areas and calculated using the adjusted individual scaling factors determined from the calibration procedure. The theoretical and adjusted scaling factors for all the loading scenarios are shown in Table 2.6 the average force error was reduced from 5.7 to 2.2 after calibration and the average zero error was reduced from 6.6 to 4.1 after calibration. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 67 to 100 of their theoretical values.

While an experimental strain curve for a 1 201 N force at position 4.5 in is not a line after applying Eq. 2.4 the calculated bending moment diagram is similar to the theoretical one for the firm rest boundary conditions. The calculated left and right reaction moments are 13 Nm and 8 Nm respectively which are within 2.8 of the largest bending moment value. The calculated d 16.6 mm with d D 16.3 and the calculated d 19.2 mm with d D 18.8 indicate that the boundary conditions were between firm and soft rest boundary conditions. Any discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated bending moments are not necessarily reflective of the errors of the calculated magnitude and position of a force.

A possible source of error was hysteresis and or temperature drift in the beam. After unloading the beam it sometimes did not return to zero strain. Another possible source of error is the low signal to noise ratio since the maximum strain gage reading of 626 was below the recommended range of 1 000 to 1 500 . A third source of error was that the vertical cross sections used for the theoretical scaling factors are not perpendicular to the neutral axes which is in violation of the Euler Bernoulli beam theory 21 . The reason that this shape was chosen was to more accurately represent the shapes of army bridges. A fourth source of error was due to horizontal reaction forces at the boundaries that were not considered in the analysis. While the above sources of error arise before calibration a fifth possible source of error for a continuously tapered beam was that there were many scaling factors the prismatic beams in Secs. 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 had only one scaling factor. It is observed from Table 2.6 that the highest scaling factor is almost an order of magnitude greater than the lowest scaling factor which demonstrates the range of applicability of Eq. 2.11 for a continuously tapered beam.

The calibrated magnitudes and positions of the forces from several force transducers are shown in Table 2.7 where the force errors were within 4.0 the zero errors were within 5.7 and the position errors were within 2.0 . The force error in each row in Table 2.7 corresponds to the error for the force transducer with the force inside its weight area and the zero error is the maximum error for the remaining force transducers that are expected to read zero. The force transducers with the forces outside the weight areas but inside the force transducers were not used and indicated as N A in Table 2.7. Note that the middle two strain gages of a force transducer can be spaced any distance apart and still accurately calculate the magnitude and position of a force as shown with FT.

A unique method has been developed to identify the magnitude and location of a load on a slender beam that is supported at both ends using four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam. When the load is located inside the weight area the magnitude and location of the load can be accurately identified. The force transducer can also identify a zero load outside the force transducer. When the load is outside the weight area but inside the force transducer the magnitude of the load can be calculated if its location is known and vice versa. The force transducer methodology can be applied to a distributed load and a combination of concentrated and distributed loads that do not cross a strain gage boundary. While the boundary conditions at the two ends can affect the strain measurements they do not affect the calculated magnitude and location of a load. The experimental results can be used to determine whether a fixed boundary is an ideal fixed boundary and whether a rest boundary is a firm rest boundary or a soft rest boundary. A calibration procedure has been developed to globally and individually adjust the scaling factors of the strain gages in calculating the magnitude of a load for prismatic and non prismatic beams respectively. Calibration can be performed for the location of a load on a non homogenous and or non prismatic beam but not on a homogeneous prismatic beam.

Experiments on a prismatic steel beam with rest boundary conditions a prismatic aluminum beam with firm rest soft rest firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions and a continuously tapered aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions validated the force transducer methodology. The force errors were within 3.7 after calibration for the prismatic beams and within 4.0 for the continuously tapered beam. The zero errors were within 5.1 for the prismatic beams and within 5.7 for the continuously tapered beam. The location of the load was accurately calculated with an error within 0.1 for the steel beam with a precise string loading. The locations of the loads for the other cases were within an error of 2.3 .

Chapter 3 Identifying Magnitudes and Locations of Multiple Loads on a Slender Beam Using Strain Gage Based Methods

Unique strain gage based methods are developed to identify magnitudes and locations of multiple loads on a slender beam. Four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam create a force transducer capable of identifying the magnitude and location of a load inside the weight area. For the case of multiple loads separated by two or more strain gage locations uniaxial strain gages forming multiple force transducers can still identify the magnitudes and locations of all the loads. However this creates an ill posed problem for loads separated by only one strain gage location. A new method has been developed using two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam one on each side of a load to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load can be used to identify the location of the load. The strain gage based methods are experimentally validated on a prismatic beam with rest boundary conditions.

The load identification problem is very important to bridge designers since the weights of vehicles that cross a bridge are not always known 2 . Using a structure itself to measure magnitudes and locations of loads is an inverse problem where the response is measured and the magnitudes and locations of the loads are identified 10 . Many different approaches such as measurements from accelerations deflections and strains have been used 1 12 18 19 27 31 . Bending moment data from strain gages are less prone to error than deflection data according to a previous study 5 . Likewise the strain model has been proven better than the acceleration model 12 . For the case of a vehicle crossing a bridge strain readings from the bridge provide the information to identify the magnitude of the load 3 4 9 .

It has been previously shown in Chapter 2 that four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of a slender beam can form a force transducer which can accurately identify the magnitude and location of a single load on the beam 31 . An inverse problem is often ill posed where the measurements do not lead to a unique solution 7 18 . The force transducer methodology is robust enough to pinpoint a desired solution when the load is located inside the weight area which is defined as a location between the two middle strain gage locations 31 . When the load is a distributed load or a combination of distributed and concentrated loads the force transducer can identify the magnitude and location of the resultant load. The methodology has been demonstrated for firm rest soft rest firm rest fixed and fixed boundary conditions as well as on a continuously tapered beam.

The force transducer methodology causes many types of error to cancel out. In the design of a strain gage based transducer temperature drift usually causes the largest error 26 . Since four uniaxial strain gages are combined to form a force transducer the temperature drift is negated for the case of a prismatic beam 31 . Another source of error in load identification is inaccurate modeling of the boundary conditions which is also negated with the methodology 31 .

This work extends the single load problem in Ref. 31 to a multiple load problem since a vehicle always consists of more than one load on the bridge due to multiple axles of the vehicle. Section 3.2.1 examines the theory for the case where there are two or more strain gage locations between two adjacent loads with the corresponding experimental data shown in Sec. 3.3.1. Section 3.2.2 examines the theory for the case where there is only one strain gage location between two adjacent loads with the corresponding experimental data shown in Sec. 3.3.2. When there is no strain gage location between two adjacent loads the magnitude and location of the resultant load can be identified as indicated in Ref. 31 .

3.2.1 Identification of Magnitudes and Locations of Loads Separated by Two or More Strain Gage Locations

Consider a slender beam with pinned boundary conditions whose reaction forces at the two boundaries are denoted by Rand R with non homogeneous material variable cross sections and N forces Fon the beam where n 1 2 . . . N as shown in . There are N 1 uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam where n 1 2 . . . N 1 with N strain gages immediately to the left of each force and one to the right of the last force. For an Euler Bernoulli beam the shear force V and the bending moment M are related through 21 

The force transducer FTformed by adjacent strain gages through in contains the weight area located between strain gages and . One can define a scaling factor where n 1 2 . . . N 1 is the strain gage number and the corresponding calibration factor for each strain gage 31 

It was shown in Ref. 31 that the position of the force Fcan be calculated when Fis inside the weight area and the other forces are outside the force transducer FT by finding the position of the intersection point of two adjacent bending moment curves 

It should be noted that the four uniaxial strain gages of a force transducer do not have to be adjacent to each other for Eq. 3.8 . Any combination of strain gages and can form a force transducer 

When two loads are separated by only one strain gage location the methodology in Sec. 3.2.1 is ill posed. There exists an infinite number of loading scenarios in reconstructing the bending moment diagram two possible bending moment diagrams are shown in . A force transducer calculates the slopes of two adjacent bending moment curves using two uniaxial strain gages for each curve 31 . The slope of the left bending moment curve in is calculated with Mand M and the slope of the right bending moment curve is calculated with Mand M. However the slope of the middle bending moment curve in cannot be calculated because only one point on the curve Mis known and the problem is ill posed.

A uniaxial strain gage mounted to the bottom surface of the beam enables one to calculate the point on the bending moment diagram Min from Eq. 3.2 . For most beams the shear stress has the maximum value at the neutral axis but can deviate from that if the thickness is significantly smaller at other locations 21 . For a stress element that is aligned with the x axis when the shear stress has a maximum value the bending stress vanishes 14 . The shear strain cannot be directly measured since the stress element under a pure shear stress r does not stretch 20 . A shear gage consists of two strain gages mounted at 45 from the x axis 32 . The two principal stresses and can be calculated from the measured principal strains and respectively at this configuration via Mohr s circle as shown in 23 

While the magnitude of the force for this loading scenario can be calculated with two adjacent shear gages the position of the force can be calculated by also using the two corresponding uniaxial strain gages. illustrates how the intersection of the bending moment curves to the left and right of the force Fgives the position p. The bending moments Mand Mare calculated using the measurements from the corresponding uniaxial strain gages and Eq. 3.2 . The shear forces Vand V which give the slopes of the left and right bending moment curves are calculated using the corresponding shear gage measurements and Eq. 3.18 . By simultaneously solving the equations for two adjacent bending moment curves the position pof the force Fcan be calculated 

The strain gage based methods are independent of the boundary conditions of the beam as demonstrated for the case of a single load on a beam with pinned firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions 31 . This is the case because the difference between the slopes of the bending moment curves to the right and left of the position pof the force Fin is not affected by other forces. Changes in the boundary conditions do not affect load identification just as the other loads on the beam do not either.

3.3.1 Identification of Magnitudes and Locations of Loads Separated by Two Strain Gage Locations on an Aluminum Beam

A quantity of 12 uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 13 250UN 350 was bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of an aluminum 6061 T6 beam with rest boundary conditions as shown in . A Vishay P3 strain indicator and a Vishay SB 10 switch unit were used to display the strain gage outputs . The loads were applied via dumbbells whose nominal weights were within 1.2 of their actual values. The cross section of the beam is a 50.8 mm square box with a 3.2 mm wall thickness and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in .

The position of a force Fis the strain gage number n directly to the left of the force added to the corresponding . The hexadecimal numbering system is used where the force transducer formed by uniaxial strain gages through is FTor FT. The calibration procedure in Chapter 2 was used where a known force was placed in each weight area and all the strains were recorded. The errors between the experimental and calculated magnitudes of the forces inside the weight areas of the force transducers are referred to as the force errors and the errors for the force transducers with the forces outside the force transducers are referred to as the zero errors. The Microsoft Excel Solver was used to reduce the maximum force and zero errors by changing with the constraint 0. The beam was then loaded with two unknown forces each weighing 222 N placed inside various weight areas separated by two or more strain gage locations and the force transducer results from the adjusted are shown in Table 3.1. The adjusted global calibration factor was 93 of the theoretical global calibration factor. The force transducers with the forces outside the weight areas but inside the force transducers were not used and indicated as N A in Table 3.1. The force errors were within 12.3 before calibration and reduced to within 4.3 after calibration. The zero errors were within 2.6 after calibration. The position errors defined by p L where L is the span of the beam as shown in were within 1.1 after calibration. The main source of error is the low signal to noise ratio since the maximum strain gage reading of 269 pr was below the recommended range of 1 000 to 1 500 for a strain gage reading 15 . Another possible cause of error was that the multiple load problem is more sensitive to response error than the single load problem 5 .

A comparison of the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for two 222 N forces at positions 3.5 and 7.5 are shown in where a rest boundary is assumed to be a firm rest boundary for the theoretical bending moment. The discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams can indicate that either a rest boundary was not an ideal firm rest boundary or there was a small measurement error for the span of the beam. The errors between the theoretical and calculated bending moments are not directly related to those between the theoretical and calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces.

The beam was also loaded with nine weights totaling 1 779 N as shown in . One can calculate the magnitude and position of the resultant force on the beam using the force transducer FT. The calculated magnitude of the resultant force was 1 768 N which had a 0.6 error. The calculated position of the resultant force had a 3.7 error. A potential application of this methodology is to identify the longitudinal center of gravity of a vehicle on a bridge. Another potential application is to identify the weight and longitudinal center of gravity of a payload on a bed of a truck or trailer by measuring strains on the frame of the truck or trailer. The theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams are shown in . The theoretical bending moment curve approaches a parabola as one would expect for a distributed load on a beam. The calculated bending moments are close to the theoretical ones.

3.3.2 Identification of Magnitudes and Locations of Loads Separated by One Strain Gage Location on the Aluminum Beam

A quantity of 12 Vishay shear gages part number CEA 13 187UV 350 was bonded along the neutral axis of the beam in at the same x locations as the uniaxial strain gages as shown in a close up view of a shear gage is shown in . Calibration was performed similar to the case in Sec. 3.3.1 where a single known force was placed inside various weight areas and the maximum force and zero errors were minimized. In this case the global calibration factors for both the uniaxial and shear gages were adjusted. The adjusted global calibration factors were 93 and 101 of the theoretical global calibration factors for the uniaxial strain gages and shear gages respectively. The beam was then loaded by two unknown forces at various positions with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location between adjacent forces including the reaction forces. Equation 3.19 was used to calculate the magnitudes of the forces using the shear gages as shown in Table 3.2. The calibrated force errors were within 6.3 and the calibrated zero errors were within 5.0 . By using both the uniaxial strain gages and the shear gages the positions of the forces were calculated from Eq. 3.20 with the calibrated position errors within 1.0 as shown in Table 3.3. Comparisons of the theoretical and calculated bending moment and shear force diagrams are shown in respectively. Any discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated bending moments do not affect the load identification methodology.

The strain gage based force transducer methodology in Chapter 2 has been extended to the case of multiple loads on a slender beam. When the loads are separated by two or more strain gage locations multiple force transducers each consisting of four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam can identify the magnitudes and locations of the loads. Each force transducer can also identify a zero load when the loads on the beam are located outside the force transducer. When the loads are separated by one strain gage location the problem is ill posed since many solutions exist for the calculated bending moment diagram. However with two shear gages one on each side of a load the magnitude of the load can be identified. When the uniaxial strain gages at the corresponding locations are also used the position of the load can be identified. When multiple loads are located inside the weight area of a force transducer the magnitude and location of the resultant load can be identified. The strain gage based methods are independent of the boundary conditions of the beam.

Experiments were performed on a prismatic aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions. For the case of two loads separated by two or more strain gage locations the force errors were within 4.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 6.3 and the errors for the relative locations of the loads were within 1.1 . For the case of two loads separated by one strain gage location the force errors were within 6.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 5.0 and the errors for the relative locations of the loads were within 1.0 .

Chapter 4 Identifying Magnitudes and Locations of Loads on Slender Beams with Welded and Bolted Joints Using a Strain Gage Based Force Transducer with Application to a Portable Army Bridge

A strain gage based force transducer has been developed to identify magnitudes and locations of loads on non continuous slender beams with welded and bolted joints. The slopes of the bending moment curves on the two sides of a load are calculated from measured strains on a beam. Four uniaxial strain gages are mounted to the bottom surface of the beam with two strain gages on each side of the load. A calibration method developed earlier can be used to account for the discrepancies between the theoretical and actual scaling factors arising from stress concentrations and unpredictable stress patterns in the beams due to the presence of the joints. The force transducer methodology is experimentally validated on a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints an aluminum beam with a constant cross section and a bolted joint a half aluminum and half steel beam with two different cross sections and a bolted joint and a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center.

Knowing the gross weight of a vehicle that cross a bridge is important in calculating its fatigue life when designing commercial or military bridges 3 . It is often impractical to obtain this information from directly instrumented vehicles 2 . Hence it is better practice to instrument a bridge via strain gages and calculate the input loads from the inverse problem 1 4 7 9 . The fatigue design load which is the vehicle weight multiplied by an impact factor is an important value when designing portable army bridges 24 . A load identification method should not only determine the static weight of a vehicle but also the dynamic interaction between the vehicle and the bridge.

A methodology to determine the magnitudes and locations of single and multiple loads on slender beams has been developed by the authors using strain gage based methods 31 33 . It has been experimentally demonstrated on continuous beams with constant cross sections and a continuously tapered beam. It has also been demonstrated on beams with different boundary conditions 31 . While the theory has been proven robust for single and multiple loads for various continuous beams with different boundary conditions a commercial or military bridge is rarely made from a constant extrusion and it would have many welded and bolted joints 34 .

This paper examines the applications of the strain gage based force transducer methodology in Ref. 31 to various laboratory beams with welded and bolted joints as well as a full scale portable army bridge. Section 4.2.1 describes how the strain gage based force transducer methodology is applied to a non continuous slender beam and Sec. 4.2.2 describes the calibration procedure. The experimental results for a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints are shown in Sec. 4.3.1. The experimental results for an aluminum beam and a half aluminum and half steel beam with bolted joints at the centers of the beams are shown in Secs. 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 respectively. Section 4.3.4 shows the application of the strain gage based force transducer methodology to a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center.

Consider a non continuous slender beam with pinned boundaries where the reaction forces are denoted by Rand R non homogeneous material variable cross sections and a force Fon the beam as shown in . There can be one or more welded and or bolted joints in the beam and it is assumed that the beam behaves linearly in its response. A strain gage based force transducer consisting of four uniaxial strain gages with two strain gages on each side of the force F is used to accurately identify the magnitude and position of the force when the force is located inside the weight area of the force transducer which is a location between the two middle strain gages 31 . The force Fcan be a concentrated force a distributed force of any shape or a combination of concentrated and distributed forces with the resultant force being F. For an Euler Bernoulli beam the shear force V and the bending moment M are related through 22 

The four strain gage measurements through are needed to calculate the slopes of the bending moment curves on the two sides of the force the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam in are shown in respectively. By subtracting the slope of the right bending moment curve in from that of the left one the formulation of the force transducer is obtained from Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2 31 

When the force is outside the force transducer the output of FTwill be zero since the slopes of the calculated bending moment curves will cancel out when subtracted. Let

The position of the force Fcan be calculated when Fis inside the weight area by finding the position of the intersection point of the two bending moment curves shown in 31 

The force transducer methodology does not depend on the boundary conditions of the beam since the sum of the reaction forces always equals the applied force 31 . Furthermore any reaction moment at a fixed or soft rest boundary of the beam does not change the slope of the bending moment curve but merely shifts it along the ordinate 25 31 . The methodology can also identify the magnitudes and locations of multiple loads on a slender beam provided that any two loads are separated by two strain gage locations 33 .

The theoretical scaling factors in Eq. 4.7 can be calculated from the geometric and material properties of a continuous beam. Modeling of a joint is often a difficult task involving extensive finite element analysis 37 39 . Instead of relying on the theoretical scaling factors calibration can be performed using known loads it is often the preferred method over analytical predictions given the complexity of bolted joints 29 37 .

The calibration procedure is set up so that a single known nonzero force F where n 2 3 . . . N 1 is placed inside the weight area of the force transducer FTthat consists of strain gages through and all the other forces on the beam are zero 31 all the strains are measured. There are N 3 strain gages on the beam that create N force transducers each of which consists of four adjacent strain gages in order to identify the magnitudes of the N nonzero forces. Equation 4.7 is modified to reflect the N force transducers created 

The calibration equation is 4.13 where F is a q 1 matrix in which q N 2N 2 that represents all the known forces including zero forces is a q m matrix in which m N 3 that represents the measured strains from strain gages forming the force transducers and is an m 1 matrix that represents the scaling factors which were assumed to be independent of loading. The force errors are defined as the relative errors between the known force magnitudes and the calculated ones from the force transducers and the zero errors are the relative errors for the outputs of the force transducers that are expected to read zero. The maximum force error is denoted by and the maximum zero error is denoted by . The total error is defined by 4.14 where C is a user defined positive parameter. The theoretical n 1 2 . . . N 3 are used as the starting point for calibration and the Microsoft Excel Solver is used to adjust all to minimize with the constraints 0 the joint effects can be accounted for by the calibration procedure. The position error is defined by p L where pis the difference between a known force position and the calculated one. By applying the calibration procedure for the magnitudes of the forces the position errors usually do not need to be calibrated 31 33 . When the scaling factors are adjusted calibration for temperature drift which can cause the largest error for strain gages 14 26 30 is also performed by zeroing strain gages before readings are taken. 4.3 Experimental Results 4.3.1 Identifying the Magnitude and Location of a Load on a Continuously Tapered Aluminum Beam with a Series of Welded Joints and Rest Boundary Conditions

A quantity of 12 uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 13 250UN 350 were bonded with equal spacing along the bottom surface of a continuously tapered aluminum 6061 T6 beam with rest boundary conditions as shown in . The theoretical Young s modulus for aluminum is 69 GPa. The beam was fabricated from a continuously tapered T shaped beam with a bent plate acting as the top flange which is connected to the web with a series of welded joints to complete an I shaped beam as shown in . A Vishay P3 strain indicator and a Vishay SB 10 switch unit were used to display the strain gage outputs. The loads were applied via dumbbells whose nominal weights were within 1.2 of their actual values. The beam has a 4.4 taper with its end view shown in and its side view with strain gage locations shown in .

The position of the force is the strain gage number n directly to the left of the force added to the corresponding relative position of the force. The hexadecimal numbering system is used where the force transducer formed by uniaxial strain gages through is FTor FT. The welded joints have an irregular pattern the position of a strain gage can correspond to a cross section of the beam that may or may not contain a welded joint. In either case the theoretical scaling factors were for the I shaped beam cross sections. Finite element analysis FEA was performed on the beam in with pinned roller boundary conditions where a roller boundary condition allows the beam to move freely in the horizontal direction and an 801 N force at position 4.5 using Pro Engineer Mechanica to demonstrate the stress concentrations due to the presence of the welded joints . The welded joints were modeled as a bonded interface and the top flange was modeled as a contact interface to the web . Comparisons of the theoretical strains for firm rest and soft rest boundary conditions the measured strains and the predicted strains from FEA for firm rest and soft rest boundary conditions are shown in where the resultant reaction forces were assumed to be 85 and 80 mm away from the edges of the left and right abutments respectively for the soft rest boundary conditions 31 . While the theoretical strains for soft rest boundary conditions were within 20.3 of the measured strains the predicted strains from FEA with soft rest boundary conditions were within 3.8 of the measured strains.

Calibration was performed using the method in Sec. 2.2 with C 0.7 in Eq. 4.14 comparisons of the theoretical FEA and adjusted along with the average force and zero errors are shown in Table 4.1 where soft rest boundary conditions were used in FEA the theoretical were for the firm rest boundary conditions and used as the starting point for calibration. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 34 to 83 of their theoretical values. Known forces of 578 N were used for calibration and unknown forces of 801 N were calculated using the same adjusted scaling factors. The average force error before calibration was 18.9 and it was reduced to 2.8 after calibration. The average zero error before calibration was 25.6 and it was reduced to 7.1 after calibration. The theoretical bending moment diagram for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moment diagrams both before and after calibration for an 801 N force at position 4.5 are shown in . Errors in the bending moment calculations are not reflected in those in load identification 31 . The errors for the calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces for various loading scenarios are shown in Table 4.2. The force errors were within 4.5 after calibration the zero errors were within 9.9 and the position errors were within 2.3 . A source of error was the low signal to noise ratio since the maximum strain gage reading of 268 was below the recommended range of 1 000 to 1 500 for a strain gage reading 15 . While the two neutral axes for the continuously tapered beam are not collinear which is needed for the Euler Bernoulli beam theory 21 and the vertical cross sections used for the theoretical scaling factors are not perpendicular to the neutral axes they can be accounted for to some extent through calibration.

A quantity of 12 uniaxial strain gages were bonded along the bottom surface of an aluminum 6061 T6 beam with a bolted joint at the center of the beam and rest boundary conditions as shown in . The cross section of the beam is a 44.5 mm square box with a 3.2 mm wall thickness and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in .

FEA was performed on the beam in with pinned roller boundary conditions zero preloads in the bolts and a 445 N force at position 4.5 using Abaqus to demonstrate the stress flow in the beam and the stress concentrations due to the presence of a bolted joint . The finite element model also had an updated Young s modulus which is 94 of the theoretical value a coefficient of friction of 1.05 between an aluminum joint plate and the aluminum beam a coefficient of friction of 0.60 between a steel bolt or nut and an aluminum plate or beam and soft rest boundary conditions where the resultant reaction forces were assumed to be 30 mm away from the edges of the abutments 31 . The stress flow in a similar prismatic beam under a 445 N force at position 4.5 is shown in . It can be seen that the normal flow of stress in is interrupted by the bolted joint which affects the strains in the neighborhood of the bolted joint. A comparison of the deflections for the beam with the bolted joint and a similar prismatic beam are shown in respectively. The predicted deflection for the beam with the bolted joint is 17.6 mm and that for the similar prismatic beam is 3.9 mm. The higher deflection for the beam with the bolted joint is due to the lower stiffness of the joint plates that have a lower moment of inertia then the beam. The linearity of the beam response can be verified from . The Microsoft Excel trend lines display the equations of the lines for the force strain relationships in as well as the coefficients of determination R where R 1 indicates a perfect correlation to a line. FEA was also performed on the beam with a force of 445 N at position 4.5 and bolt tension values of 1.7 8.5 and 17.0 kN which would correspond to bolt torque values of 1.36 6.78 and 13.56 Nm respectively according to Eq. 4.3 where a lubricated bolt was assumed to have K 0.1 and 8 mm. Comparisons of raw strains due to the preloads in the bolts and the applied load strains due to the preloads in the bolts referred to as preload strains and strains due to the applied load referred to as zeroed strains which are obtained by subtracting the preload strains from the raw strains for different bolt tension values are shown in . While the bolt torque creates higher preload strains near the bolted joint the preload strains elsewhere on the beam are almost zero. Hence k 1 in Eq. 4.5 away from the bolted joint and the corresponding are close to their theoretical values for a continuous beam. While a higher torque value produces a higher preload strain at strain gage which is closest to the bolted joint the zeroed strains are almost the same.

The bolt torque was varied experimentally to validate the linear response of the beam in . The responses of strain gages and are shown in for five different magnitudes of the force at position 6.5 and three different bolt torque values 1.36 6.78 and 13.56 Nm the strain gages were zeroed after a preload was applied and before readings were taken. All the lines in had R 0.9992 which validated that the beam response is linear. For strain gages and the differences among the slopes of the lines for the force strain relationships were within 3.9 1.9 and 1.6 respectively for the three bolt torque values. It was observed that when the bolt torque was changed from 1.36 to 6.78 Nm strain gages and increased by about 190 while the other strain gages that were away from the bolted joint stayed within 2 which is consistent with the FEA result. Similarly when the bolt torque was changed from 6.78 to 13.56 Nm strain gages and increased by about 150 while the other strain gages stayed within 2 . Comparisons of the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the three torque values for a 445 N force at position 4.5 are shown in . Comparisons of the theoretical strains for firm rest boundary conditions the measured strains for the bolt torque of 13.56 Nm and the corresponding zeroed strains from FEA are shown in . There were drops in the measured strains at strain gages and and the corresponding zeroed strains from FEA because the bolted joint stiffens the beam in its neighborhood.

The theoretical bending moments for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moments from a global scaling factor which is 93 of its theoretical value for a 445 N force at position 9.5 have noticeable discrepancies at strain gages and due to the stiffening effect of the bolted joint . Calibration was performed using the method in Sec. 4.2.2 with C 1 in Eq. 4.14 the comparison of the theoretical and adjusted along with the average force and zero errors is shown in Table 4.3. The known force of 445 N was placed in five weight areas and the unknown force of 445 N was calculated for the remaining four weight areas using the same scaling factors. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 93 to 106 of their theoretical values. The average force error before calibration was 14.6 and it was reduced to 2.8 after calibration. The average zero error before calibration was 31.1 and it was reduced to 6.0 after calibration. The errors for the calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces for various loading scenarios are shown in Table 4.4. The force errors were within 5.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 9.6 and the position errors were within 1.7 . The theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for a 445 N force at position 9.5 are shown in .

A quantity of six uniaxial Vishay strain gages part number CEA 06 250UN 350 were bonded along the bottom surface of a beam the left half of which is the same as that in and the right half of which is a steel A36 beam with a bolted joint at the center of the beam . The theoretical Young s modulus for steel is 200 GPa. The cross section of the steel part of the beam is a 38.1 mm square box with a 3.2 mm wall thickness the joint plates are the same as those in and there is a plate between the top joint plate and the steel part of the beam because of different dimensions of the cross sections of the aluminum and steel parts of the beam . The side view of the beam with strain gage locations is shown in . The experiment here demonstrated the applicability of the methodology to a beam with non homogenous material since the Young s modulus of the aluminum part of the beam differs significantly from that of the steel part of the beam. FEA performed here with Mechanica shows the discontinuity in the stress flow at the joint similar to that in Sec. 4.3.2 for the beam in with pinned boundary conditions zero preloads in the bolts and a 445 N force at position 2.5 . It should be noted that there is no stress in the plate between the top joint plate and the top of the steel part of the beam.

The theoretical bending moments for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moments from a global scaling factor which is 88 of its theoretical values for a 445 N force at position 9.5 have more discrepancies at strain gages and due to the stiffening effect of the bolted joint . Calibration was performed using the method in Sec. 4.2.2 with C 0.5 in Eq. 4.14 the comparison of the theoretical and adjusted along with the average force and zero errors is shown in Table 4.5. The known force of 445 N was placed in five weight areas and the unknown force of 445 N was calculated for the remaining four weight areas using the same scaling factors. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 94 to 104 of their theoretical values. The average force error before calibration was 11.6 and it was reduced to 3.0 after calibration. The average zero error before calibration was 21.5 and it was reduced to 4.1 after calibration. The errors for the calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces for various loading scenarios are shown in Table 4.6. The force errors were within 4.7 after calibration the zero errors were within 4.9 and the position errors were within 1.0 . The theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for a 445 N force at position 9.5 are shown in .

The force transducer methodology was used to measure the magnitude and location of a load on a portable army bridge on the Bridge Crossing Simulator BCS which is operated by the US Army Aberdeen Test Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland USA . The BCS tests portable army bridges for fatigue failure by simulating thousands of vehicle crossings. The BCS consists of ten pairs of hydraulic cylinders the two cylinders in each pair are connected by a Whiffle which applies a load to the bridge via eight pads as shown in . First a bridge is set up on dirt abutments and measured strains from the bridge are collected from vehicles with various crossing speeds. Next the bridge is set up on the BCS with wood abutments and straps which create boundary conditions that are between rest and fixed boundary conditions and loads from multiple Whiffles are applied to the bridge to simulate various crossing speeds of vehicles. A load identification methodology can be used to identify cylinder loads that need to be applied from measured strains from live crossings of vehicles.

The portable army bridge shown in has a span of 46 meters a height of 1.2 meters a width of 4.3 meters and a cross section that consists of four I shaped beams and a deck as shown in . Twenty uniaxial strain gages were bonded along the bottom flange of the bridge at the hydraulic cylinder locations. The bridge consists of eight modules as shown in which are connected by bolted joints and each module has many welded and bolted joints. The BCS was used to apply two known 89 kN forces at the roadside and curbside matching cylinders in at various locations along the bridge. The resultant force from each cylinder consists of four distributed forces at the pads as shown in . Since the force applied on each side is at a strain gage location a force transducer used to identify the force was formed by two strain gages to the left of the force and two to the right. The zero errors were calculated by force transducers that do not contain the strain gage at the force position. For instance to identify the magnitude and position of a force at position 3.0 the force transducer FTwas used the zero errors were calculated by force transducers FT FT and FT. Calibration was performed independently for each side of the bridge using the method in Sec. 4.2.2 the theoretical scaling factors that were calculated from the cross section in were used as the starting point and C 1 in Eq. 4.14 . The adjusted scaling factors are shown in Table 4.7. Since the bridge has many welded and bolted joints and the end modules have variable cross sections the scaling factors of the strain gages at various locations along the bridge differed significantly with the maximum to minimum scaling factor ratio being 147 . However since the bridge is almost symmetric from the roadside to the curbside the roadside to curbside scaling factor ratio is between 90 to 107 . The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 75 to 110 of their theoretical values. Two unknown forces of 67 kN were applied at the roadside and curbside matching cylinders in four weight areas of the roadside and curbside force transducers with the results shown in Tables 4.8 and 4.9. The roadside force errors were within 5.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 13.7 and the position errors were within 5.3 . The curbside force errors were within 3.8 after calibration the zero errors were within 13.2 and the position errors were within 5.1 . The theoretical bending moment diagram for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moment diagram for two 67 kN forces at position 5.0 are shown in . The reaction moments at the boundaries were calculated to be negative due to the straps at the abutments.

Using four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of a slender beam with welded and bolted joints the magnitude and location of a load on the beam can be accurately identified. Each force transducer can also identify a zero load when the load on the beam is located outside the force transducer. The force transducer methodology will work for any slender non continuous non homogenous beam with variable cross sections and different types of boundary conditions as long as the response of the beam is linear. The theoretical scaling factors are calculated from geometric and material properties of the beam and adjusted during a calibration procedure to account for the joint and other effects.

Experiments were performed on slender beams with welded and bolted joints and rest boundary conditions. For the continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints in Sec. 4.3.1 the force errors were within 4.5 after calibration the zero errors were within 9.9 and the position errors were within 2.3 . The adjusted scaling factors differed significantly from the theoretical scaling factors and the calibration procedure reduced the average force error from 18.9 to 2.8 . For the aluminum beam with a bolted joint in Sec. 4.3.2 the force errors were within 5.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 9.6 and the position errors were within 1.7 . The adjusted scaling factors were within 7 of the theoretical scaling factors. FEA for zero preloads in the bolts and experiments for different bolt torque values confirmed that the response of the beam was linear. For a half aluminum and half steel beam with a bolted joint in Sec. 4.3.3 the force errors were within 4.7 after calibration the zero errors were within 4.6 and the position errors were within 1.0 . The adjusted scaling factors were within 6 of the theoretical scaling factors. The force transducer methodology was validated on a non continuous and non homogenous beam with two different cross sections in this case. For the portable army bridge on the BCS in Sec. 4.3.4 the force errors were within 5.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 13.7 and the position errors were within 5.3 . While the scaling factors differed significantly along the bridge the roadside and curbside scaling factors were within 7 of each other. The theoretical scaling factors were a good starting point for calibration in all cases.

A unique strain gage based method has been developed that can identify the magnitude and location of a load within a weight area of a force transducer. When the load is outside the force transducer a zero load is accurately identified without influence from other loads on the beam. The load can be a concentrated load distributed load or a combination of each. The goal of the force transducer methodology was to have force errors within 5 zero errors within 10 and position errors within 5 . For the experimental results of Chapter 2 the force errors were within 3.7 after calibration for the prismatic beams and within 4.0 for the continuously tapered beam. The zero errors were within 5.1 for the prismatic beams and within 5.7 for the continuously tapered beam. The location of the load was accurately calculated with an error within 0.1 for the steel beam with a precise string loading. The locations of the loads for the other cases were within an error of 2.3 .

The force transducer methodology was also applied to multiple loads on a beam that are separated by two strain gage locations. For the experimental results of Chapter 3 the force errors were within 4.3 the zero errors were within 6.3 and the position errors were within 1.1 . A new strain gage based method was developed using shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of a beam along with the uniaxial strain gages mounted on the bottom surface of the beam. For the case of two loads separated by one strain gage location the force errors were within 6.3 after calibration the zero errors were within 5.0 and the position errors were within 1.0 .

The force transducer methodology was applied to beams with welded and bolted joints in Chapter 4 with stress concentration factors due to the joints being accounted for through the calibration procedure developed here. Experiments were performed on three laboratory beams as well as a portable army bridge on the BCS. For a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints the force errors were within 4.5 the zero errors were within 9.9 and the position errors were within 2.3 . For an aluminum beam with a bolted joint the force errors were within 5.3 the zero errors were within 9.6 and the position errors were within 1.7 . For a half aluminum and half steel beam with a bolted joint the force errors were within 4.7 the zero errors were within 4.6 and the position errors were within 1.0 . For the portable army bridge on the BCS the force errors were within 5.3 the zero errors were within 13.7 and the position errors were within 5.3 .

The force transducer methodology developed here successfully identifies the magnitudes and locations of loads on non continuous non homogenous slender beams with variable cross sections welded and bolted joints and pinned firm rest soft rest pinned fixed and fixed boundary conditions by using four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam when adjacent loads are separated by two strain gage locations. It is also used to determine the boundary conditions by calculating the bending moment diagram. When there are multiple loads separated by only one strain gage location another method developed here uses two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam one on each side of a load to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load is used to identify the location of the load. These methods have not been developed before and are innovative to the field of load identification. The calibration method and corresponding calibration matrix developed here is innovative and useful for strain gage based force transducers. By systematically applying known nonzero loads along the beam in various weight areas both the nonzero load and nonzero loads are accounted for through calibration. The Microsoft Excel Solver is used to optimize the individual scaling factors of strain gages while reducing the maximum force and zero errors.

A limitation of the theory at this point is that the beam should be a slender beam governed by the Euler Bernoulli beam theory. Another limitation of the force transducer methodology is when two forces are separated by one uniaxial strain gage the problem is ill posed. However the additional strain gage based method developed here using shear gages creates a unique solution for that case.

Future research will be conducting static experiments on the portable army bridge on the BCS using shear gages to determine loads separated by one strain gage location. Additional research will be the application of the strain gage based methods to determine the magnitude and location of dynamic loads on a bridge. As long as the sampling rate of the strain data is sufficiently high the methods would work for static and dynamic loads. Specifically the dynamic loading can be used to identify the cylinder forces for the BCS at Aberdeen Test Center. A computer algorithm can be developed to identify the magnitudes and locations of dynamic loads on a bridge by filtering zero loads below a threshold i.e. 10 of the load and calculating the vehicle speed. Another type of bridge that can be tested on the BCS is a truss bridge based off of the Bailey Bridge design as shown in . The load identification methods developed here can be extended for a truss bridge with periodically changing cross sections. The methods developed here can also be extended to a bridge with multiple supports.

The existing methodology can be tested on commercial bridges as well as army bridges. There are additional challenges of commercial bridges that do not exist for the portable army bridge used here there can be additional supports under the bridge there can be a nonlinear response such as for a concrete bridge there can be small strain readings which can yield a low signal to noise ratio and vehicles can cross at high speeds giving a large dynamic effect. It is also possible that a vehicle that is accelerating can produce large longitudinal loads that were not accounted for in this methodology.

Other future research can be developing a more robust method to determine the accuracy of experimental boundary conditions by recreating the bending moment curve and calculating the reaction moments at the end abutments. The distinction between firm rest and soft rest can be determined using strain data and can be applied also to military bridges resting on dirt end abutments. The accuracy of a simulated fixed boundary created from a clamp can be determined by calculating the reaction moments.

Lastly future research can focus on non slender beams that are governed by the Timoshenko beam theory instead of the Euler Bernoulli beam theory. It is possible that the strain gage based methods developed here can be extended to such non slender beams if the beam response is linear at the strain gage locations.
