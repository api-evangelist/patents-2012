title: Anonymous personal content access with content bridge
abstract: An online content publishing and consumption environment can be modeled such that communities of content consumers (users), such as educational institutes and libraries, are categorized as Content Brokers; content providers, such as book, music, and multimedia publishers, and news sources, are categorized as Content Providers; and a Content Bridge, a standalone component providing the functionalities of the presently claimed invention in the online content publishing and consumption environment. The Content Bridge allows a simpler and loosely-coupled integration with lowered integration cost and effort, as the Content Broker is required to integrate once only with the Content Bridge instead of having to integrate individually with every Content Provider.

The present invention relates generally to networking and electronic content publishing and retrieval technologies. Specifically the present invention relates to networked online content access and single sign on technologies.

A user often needs to access online contents provided by a number of different content providers in the Internet. Often some of these content providers require user authentication and authorization before granting accesses to its contents. For example a content provider allows accesses to its privileged contents only to paid subscribers as such it requires a user to authenticate and identify herself as a paid subscriber.

For a heavy content consumer subscribed to many different content providers having to establish an account in each content provider and authenticate each time for content access in each content provider is a highly redundant and inconvenient activity. Some existing solutions provide content aggregator portals aggregating online contents from disparate content providers into a single online asset or web site. This way the content consumer needs only one account and one time authentication at the content aggregator portal. Other variations of content aggregating solution place the content aggregator at the content consumer s client computing device for example the browser. However these content aggregator solutions require tight coupling integrations with the content providers that are expensive and complicated. Also user authentication credentials must still be established for each content provider and stored in the content aggregator.

Still some other existing solutions use some forms of a dedicated single sign on SSO system in which a primary authentication system is used to store and manage user accounts and provide authentications and authorizations to the users. In these SSO systems trusted logged in sessions are maintained for logged in users and are propagated to the integrated content providers as the logged in users access them. The integrated content providers rely on the trusted logged in sessions in permitting user accesses without presenting authentication challenges thus achieving the single sign on functionality. However these solutions also require tight coupling integrations with the content providers that are expensive and complicated.

It is an objective of the presently claimed invention to provide a method and system that enables an online user to access one or more online contents from one or more different content providers anonymously or using a single online identity. It is a further objective to provide such method and system that the online user after being recognized and authenticated by one community system is authorized to access the one or more online contents from the one or more different content providers without being challenged for authentication at each of the one or more different content providers. It is still a further objective that such method and system utilize open standard for online user authentication and authorization wherein the authorization methods are asymmetrical enabling secure content access and wherein the authentication uses private OpenID enabling social network functionalities.

In accordance to one embodiment an online content publishing and consumption environment can be modeled such that communities of content consumers users such as educational institutes and libraries are categorized as Content Brokers content providers such as book music and multimedia publishers and news sources are categorized as Content Providers and a Content Bridge a standalone component providing the functionalities of the presently claimed invention in the online content publishing and consumption environment. The Content Bridge allows a simpler and loosely coupled integration with lowered integration cost and effort as the Content Broker is required to integrate once only with the Content Bridge instead of having to integrate individually with every Content Provider.

In the following description methods and systems for accessing as an anonymous user one or more online contents from one or more different content providers and the like are set forth as preferred examples. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications including additions and or substitutions may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

In accordance to one embodiment the online content publishing and consumption environment can be modeled such that communities of content consumers users such as educational institutes and libraries categorized as Content Brokers content providers such as book music and multimedia publishers and news sources categorized as Content Providers and the Content Bridge a standalone component providing the functionalities of the presently claimed invention in the online content publishing and consumption environment.

Each Content Provider and Content Broker incorporates the Adapter module which is an interfacing computer instruction or software code that facilitates the data exchanges and invocations of computer instruction or software code functions between the Content Broker Content Provider s computer instruction or software code and the CB Library . Each Content Provider and Content Broker also incorporates the CB Library module which is an interfacing computer instruction or software code that facilitates the data exchanges and invocations of computer instruction or software code functions between the Content Broker Content Provider and the Content Bridge .

The computer instruction or software code of the Content Broker Content Provider interacts with the CB Library via the Adapter . Among other functionalities the CB Library provides a set of functions enabling the registration of a Content Broker or Content Provider at the Content Bridge wherein such registration results in a set of values to be retained by the Content Broker or Content Provider and the Content Bridge for user authentication and authorization. The Adapter and the CB Library modules can be integrated within and executed by the Content Broker Content Provider s one or more processing servers.

The Content Bridge comprises one or more sub modules including one or more Web Portals one or more Open Application Program Interfaces APIs one or more Managers and a Core . The Web Portals include one or more user interfaces wherein the user interfaces are accessible and displayable by users system operators and administrators through the use of a client computing device running a typical browser application software program or any application software program conforming to the common data transmission protocols such as TCP IP HTTP and HTML. The Web Portals user interfaces can be grouped into Operator Portal User Portal and Partner Portal. The Operator Portal comprises user interfaces for Content Bridge system operators and administrators to perform Content Broker and Content Provider partners management order management user management content management and statistics compilation retrieval and analysis. The User Portal comprises user interfaces for users to manage their own profiles perform social networking functions such as online web logs blogs posting commenting online posting commenting and sharing and perform content related functions such as content searching previewing and purchasing. The Partner Portal comprises user interfaces for Content Broker and Content Provider system operators and administrators to perform registration management order management and statistics compilation retrieval and analysis.

The Open APIs are a set of computer instructions or software codes with defined exposed invocation points for performing certain functions upon invocations. The functions provided by the Open APIs include but not limited to user authentication content related functions such as content searching and browsing content access related functions such as content previewing and retrieval content purchase related functions such as order placement reviewing and management and social networking functions such as online web logs blogs posting commenting online posting commenting and sharing.

The Managers are a set of computer instructions or software codes that handle requests of data exchanges and computer instruction or software code function invocations from the Open APIs . The Managers also manage data entities with defined application logic.

The Core comprises a database with a defined data model wherein the defined data model comprises at least the following data entities 

Referring to . In accordance to one embodiment of the presently claimed invention the content access process comprises a user of one of the Content Brokers accessing and viewing a User Portal user interface rendered by the Content Bridge and requesting to access an online content the Content Bridge requesting from the Content Broker a first access token for the user since the user has not yet authenticated the Content Broker responding with an indication for authentication and an authentication URL the Content Bridge redirecting the user to a user interface accessible at the authentication URL wherein the user interface accessible at the authentication URL being hosted by the Content Broker the user authenticating by using his her credential previously determined and preserved at the Content Broker wherein the authentication step being conformed to the HTTPS standard for enhanced security upon successful authentication the user again requesting to access the online content the Content Bridge requesting from the Content Broker the first access token for the user since the user has been authenticated the Content Broker responding with the first access token for the user the Content Bridge further requesting user information from the Content Broker wherein the user information including a first user identifier associating the user to the Content Broker the Content Broker responding with the user information the Content Bridge performing an ID mapping method step mapping the first user identifier associating the user to the Content Broker to a second user identifier associating the user to the Content Provider providing the online content requested wherein both the first user identifier and the second user identifier have been previously established and preserved by the Content Bridge with the second user identifier the Content Bridge requesting a second access token from the Content Provider the Content Provider responding with the second access token with the second access token the Content Bridge redirecting the user to a user interface accessible at a content URL where the online content requested is available the user accessing the content URL along with the second access token the Content Provider upon receiving the content access request with the second access token returning the online content requested .

Referring to . To demonstrate the method step of ID mapping an exemplary use case a user ordering online contents via a Content Bridge is used. In this exemplary use case a teacher user of a school a Content Broker previously registered with the Content Bridge is placing a purchase order of online contents. The purchase order consists of online contents from two Content Providers Content Provider and Content Provider thus the purchase order is split into two sub orders. While the user has previously made purchases at Content Provider she has never purchased anything from Content Provider thus never has established an account with Content Provider .

The use case starts by the user placing the purchase order of online contents wherein the purchase order is attached with content identifiers and a first user identifier associating the user to Content Broker the purchase order data being received by the Content Bridge the purchase order data being processed resulting in two sub orders Order and Order wherein Order is for content and is attached with a first provider identifier associating with Content Provider and wherein Order is for content and is attached with a second provider identifier associating with Content Provider the Content Bridge performing an ID mapping method step mapping the first user identifier to a second user identifier associating the user to Content Provider wherein both the first user identifier and the second user identifier have been previously established and preserved by the Content Bridge the Content Bridge then sending Order attached with the second user identifier to Content Provider Content Provider receiving Order and processing Order and responding with a transaction result in parallel steps the Content Bridge failing to perform an ID mapping method step mapping the first user identifier to a user identifier associating the user to Content Provider consequently sending Order to Content Provider without any user identifier Content Provider receiving Order Content Provider creating a third user identifier Content Provider processing Order and responding with a transaction result along with the third user identifier the Content Bridge receiving the transaction result and the third user identifier and creating a new mapping for the first user identifier and third user identifier .
