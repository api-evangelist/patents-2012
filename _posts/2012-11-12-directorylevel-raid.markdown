Various embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to computing systems and in particular to data storage within such computing systems.

The explosion of social networking has led to extensive sharing of information including items such as videos photos blogs links etc. In order to support the demand on information sharing and data storage more and more physical storage devices are incorporated into the existing data storage systems. Data stored on each physical storage device may represent significant memories or assets for many users. However physical storage devices may fail randomly or after a certain amount of usage. Data losses can be costly in terms of wasted time and loss of good will from users.

One solution is to implement a Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID . In a RAID system data is replicated into two or more copies across independent disks collectively referred to as an array. A RAID controller adds parity data to the original data before storing it across the array. The parity data is used to recover the original data in the event of disk failures.

Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a variety of methods systems and paradigms for reducing replication factor in a file system. For example instead of performing file level RAID the present teach provides for directory level RAID. In some embodiments two or more requested files may be grouped together under a leaf directory for RAID process. All data under the directory are grouped into one or more data stripes each of which comprises a plurality of data blocks. One or more parity data blocks may be generated for each data stripe according to a computing algorithm such as an exclusive OR XOR code or a Reed Solomon RS code. All parity blocks corresponding to the two or more requested files are concatenated into one parity file. Data blocks of files in the directory and corresponding parity blocks may be written to separate partitions and or separate storage drives of the file system.

When a specific parity block or a specific data block of a data strip in the leaf directory is missing or corrupted the parity block or the specific data block can be reconstructed from the remaining parity block s and data blocks stored in the file system. If a specific data block of a data stripe is missing the specific data block can be reconstructed from the remaining data blocks in the specific data stripe and parity blocks corresponding to the specific data stripe. If a specific parity block is missing the specific parity block can be reconstructed from the specific data stripe corresponding to the specific parity block and remaining parity block s corresponding to the specific data stripe.

In some embodiments an original checksum may be computed when parity blocks are generated for files under a leaf directory. A second checksum is computed when a specific data block or a specific parity block is reconstructed based on the remaining data blocks in the data stripe and remaining parity blocks corresponding to the data stripe. The reconstructed data block or the reconstructed parity block may be rewritten to the file system only if the value of the second checksum matches the value of the original checksum.

In some embodiments the number of data blocks in each data stripe may be predetermined or defined by RAID algorithms. Data blocks of a specific data stripe may have the same or different sizes of data. In some embodiments the size of parity blocks corresponding to the specific data stripe may be predetermined or set to the maximum size of data blocks in the specific data stripe.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to directory level RAID. More specifically various embodiments of the present invention relate systems and methods for reducing replication factor by implementing directory level RAID in a file system. Traditionally file systems only support file level RAID. For each file a separate parity file is generated during RAID process. Replication ratios of these systems could be significantly higher than theoretical ratios. In contrast various embodiments of the present disclosure support directory level RAID. Requested files are grouped under a leaf directory. One parity file is generated for all files under the leaf directory during RAID process. Therefore the last stripe problem can be greatly reduced which results in improved replication ratios.

While examples described herein refer to a social networking system the descriptions should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present disclosure. Various alternatives modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without varying from the spirit of the invention. For example directory level RAID may be implemented in any computing system organizing collected data. For another example directory level RAID may be implemented in any computing system having a database management system DBMS . The DBMS may include well known DBMS such as FoxPro IBM DB2 Linter Microsoft SQL Server MySQL Oracle PostgreSQL and SQLite etc.

The social networking system further described below in conjunction with comprises one or more computing devices storing user profiles associated with users and or other objects as well as connections between users and other users and or objects an access management system and a plurality of databases such as database . Users can store data i.e. photos videos messages electronic documents e mails records and related analytics i.e. usage analytics in the social networking system . The data can be submitted through various user devices and or other devices to allow the data to be stored on database . As illustrated in these devices and tools may use network to submit and retrieve information from the social networking system .

In some embodiments users join the social networking system and then add connections to other users or objects of the social networking system to which they desire to be connected. As further described below in conjunction with users of the social networking system may be individuals or entities such as businesses organizations universities and manufacturers. The social networking system allows its users to interact with each other as well as with other objects maintained by the social networking system . In some embodiments the social networking system allows users to interact with third party websites and the financial account provider .

Based on stored data about users objects and connections between users and or objects the social networking system generates and maintains a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph represents an object or user that can act on another node and or that can be acted on by another node. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. For example when a user identifies an additional user as a friend an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and an additional node representing the additional user. The generated edge has a connection type indicating that the users are friends. As various nodes interact with each other the social networking system modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the interactions.

User devices can be any computing device capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment user devices are a conventional computer system such as a desktop or laptop computer . In another embodiment user devices may be mobile device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone smart phone or similar device. User devices are configured to communicate with access management system and or the financial account provider via the network . In one embodiment a user device executes an application allowing a user of the user devices to interact with the access management system . For example user devices can execute a browser application to enable interaction between the user devices and access management system via the network . In another embodiment user devices interact with access management system through an application programming interface API that runs on the native operating system of the user device such as IOS or ANDROID .

User devices can be configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network may include one or more networks of any type i.e. wired and or wireless . For example the network may include a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN an ad hoc network the Internet an intranet a personal area network PAN a storage area network a home area network a campus area network a backbone network a metropolitan area network MAN an enterprise private network a virtual private network a virtual network a cellular telephone network a satellite network a telephone network i.e. a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN an internet work or a combination of two or more of these. The network may use technologies such as Ethernet as defined by IEEE 802.XX 4G Long Term Evolution LTE 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS High Speed Packet Access HSPA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced IMT Advanced or a combination of two or more of these.

The networking protocols used in the network may include Transmission Control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP Internetwork Packet Exchange Sequenced Packet Exchange IPX SPX User Datagram Protocol UDP Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Post Office Protocol POP3 File Transfer Protocol FTP Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP X.25 AX.25 AppleTalk or a combination of two or more of these. Data exchanged over the network may be represented using formats such as HTML SGML based HTML and or XML based HTML etc.

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each data field describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of the social networking system . The user profile information stored in user profile store describes the users of the social networking system including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images videos or other objects. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information on users of the social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the edge store .

As further described below a user profile may be associated with one or more financial accounts allowing the user profile to include data retrieved from or derived from a financial account. A user may specify one or more privacy settings which are stored in the user profile that limit information from a financial account that the social networking system is permitted to access. For example a privacy setting limits the social networking system to accessing the transaction history of the financial account and not the current account balance. As another example a privacy setting limits the social networking system to a subset of the transaction history of the financial account allowing the social networking system to access transactions within a specified time range transactions involving less than a threshold transaction amounts transactions associated with specified vendor identifiers transactions associated with vendor identifiers other than specified vendor identifiers or any suitable criteria limiting information from a financial account identified by a user that is accessible by the social networking system . In one embodiment information from the financial account is stored in the user profile store . In other embodiments it may be stored in the financial account store which is further described below.

The content store stores content items associated with a user profile such as images videos or audio files. Content items from the content store may be displayed when a user profile is viewed or when other content associated with the user profile is viewed. For example displayed content items may show images or video associated with a user profile or show text describing a user s status. Additionally other content items may facilitate user engagement by encouraging a user to expand his or her connections to other users to invite new users to the system or to increase interaction with the social network system by displaying content related to users objects activities or functionalities of the social networking system . Examples of social networking content items include suggested connections or suggestions to perform other actions media provided to or maintained by the social networking system e.g. pictures or videos status messages or links posted by users to the social networking system events groups pages e.g. representing an organization or commercial entity and any other content provided by or accessible via the social networking system.

The content store also includes one or more pages associated with entities having user profiles in the user profile store . An entity is a non individual user of the social networking system such as a business a vendor an organization or a university. A page includes content associated with an entity and instructions for presenting the content to a social networking system user. For example a page identifies content associated with the entity s user profile as well as information describing how to present the content to users viewing the brand page. Vendors may be associated with pages in the content store allowing social networking system users to more easily interact with the vendor via the social networking system . A vendor identifier is associated with a vendor s page allowing the social networking system to identify the vendor and or to retrieve additional information about the vendor from the user profile store the action log or from any other suitable source using the vendor identifier. In some embodiments the content store may also store one or more targeting criteria associated with stored objects and identifying one or more characteristics of a user to which the object is eligible to be presented.

The action logger receives communications about user actions on and or off the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user among others. In some embodiments the action logger receives subject to one or more privacy settings transaction information from a financial account associated with a user and identifies user actions from the transaction information. For example the action logger retrieves vendor identifiers from the financial account s transaction history and identifies an object such as a page in the social networking system associated with the vendor identifier. This allows the action logger to identify a user s purchases of products or services that are associated with a page or another object in the content store . In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well. These actions are stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as external website that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system including commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items in a sequence or other interactions. Information describing these actions is stored in the action log . Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communications between users becoming a fan of a musician adding an event to a calendar joining a group becoming a fan of a brand page creating an event authorizing an application using an application and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log records a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of the user augmenting the interests included in the user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on external websites and or determined from a financial account associated with the user. For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of a social networking system through social plug ins that enable the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as this sporting equipment retailer may use the information about these users as they visit their websites. The action log records data about these users including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying. Actions identified by the action logger from the transaction history of a financial account associated with the user allow the action log to record further information about additional types of user actions. In some embodiments content of the action log may be stored in the database .

In one embodiment an edge store stores the information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system in edge objects. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system. The edge store stores edge objects that include information about the edge such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored in one edge object in the edge store in one embodiment. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

In one embodiment the database may be defined as a computer system for serving data to users. The database may be a computer system as described in . In some embodiments the database may include for example a file system a Hadoop machine an HBase a file server machine or a computer connected to multiple storage devices.

The database may contain any type of computer writable and readable storage media. By way of example the storage media may include a volatile memory i.e. a random access memory RAM etc. a non volatile memory i.e. a flash memory a read only memory ROM etc. a hard disk an optical disc a floppy disk a magnetic tape a solid state drive SSD a secure digital SD card or any suitable computer readable storage medium or a combination of two or more of these.

In one embodiment data blocks are stored in a RAID array. A parity file may be generated for each file in the RAID array by using well known computing algorithms for example an exclusive OR XOR code or a Reed Solomon RS code. The parity file consists of one or more parity blocks. Each data stripe may correspond to one or more parity blocks in the parity file. For example one or more parity blocks are computed with a RAID controller by XORing all data blocks in a data stripe to generate the one or more parity blocks corresponding to the data blocks of the data stripe. In some implementations the RS code treats each data block as a number between 0 and 2 1 and operates on these numbers with Galois Field arithmetic GF 2 .

For a given RAID code the replication factor of a file may depend on a variety of factors which include size of the file size of each stripe size of each data block the number of parity blocks for each stripe and or the replication number. If size of each stripe size of each data block and the number of parity blocks are fixed the replication factor may be determined by the size of each file. illustrate data storage examples when the number of data blocks in each data stripe as illustrated in decreases from 10 to 2. In the replication factor of unRAID replication remains unchanged. In the replication factors with XOR RAID and RS RAID have increased to 6 2 3 from their initial values 2.2 and 1.4 respectively. In these scenarios there is no storage savings between mirroring replication versus RAID replication with either an XOR code or an RS code.

In some embodiments a RAID controller may group two or more requested files under one leaf directory to reduce replication factor. The files may include texts videos audios word documents spreadsheets user profiles information of connections and interactions between users and or files with a variety of sizes. The two or more files under the leaf directory are grouped into one or more data stripes and then RAIDed together to generate one parity file using algorithms such as XOR or RS. Each data stripe may consist of a number of data blocks for example 10 data blocks etc. with the same or different sizes of data. The parity file may consist of one or more parity blocks. The number of parity blocks corresponding to each data stripe may be a predetermined number according to a specific RAID algorithm or a user defined parameter. The size of parity blocks may be predetermined or defined by RAID algorithms. In some embodiments each parity block has the same size as each data block. In some embodiments the size of parity blocks may depend on the size of files in the leaf directory. For example if every file in the directory is small and has a partial data block the size of parity blocks may be set to the maximum size of all partial blocks.

In some embodiments individual file s in the leaf directory may be selected modified and or deleted separately. It should be appreciated that the leaf directory structure is provided for the sake of clarity. A non leaf directory may also be used to group two or more files for RAID. In some implementations all files may be grouped in a single level directory.

In some embodiments RAID controller and or access management system may monitor access statistics of each file and categorize files into a plurality of groups according to access frequencies. Files with access frequencies below a predetermined level may be grouped into a leaf directory for a directory level RAID. In some implementations the RAID controller may include a dedicated RAID controller chip to improve RAID throughput. In some implementations the RAID controller may include a standard controller chip with special firmware and drivers.

In some embodiments RAID data blocks i.e. parity blocks and data blocks of the leaf directory may be written to separate partitions and or span over separate storage devices of the database . When one or more RAID data blocks get lost due to disk failure power failure system crash and or virus attack the lost one or more RAID data blocks may be restored by copying replicated data blocks stored in other partitions and or storage devices and or reconstructed by computing remaining data and parity blocks of the directory stored in separate partitions and or separate storage devices. In some implementations the RS code reconstructs lost one or more RAID data blocks by deleting rows in a Vandermode matrix which corresponds to the lost one or more RAID data blocks inverting the matrix and multiplying the inverse by the surviving data blocks.

In some embodiments when the structure of the leaf directory is changed files in the new leaf directory may be RAIDed together to generate new RAID data blocks i.e. parity blocks and data blocks . RAID data blocks of the old leaf directory are then removed from the database when new RAID data blocks are written to the database .

In some embodiments the RAID controller may be configured to calculate a checksum during a RAID process. For example a checksum may be calculated each time a leaf directory is RAIDed and stored to the database . The checksum is written to the database together with data blocks and parity blocks of data in the leaf directory. In the event one or more data blocks or parity blocks of data in the leaf directory are reconstructed the RAID controller or the access management system may calculate the checksum again and compare it to the checksum value originally calculated and stored in the database . If two checksum values match reconstruction process is successful. If two checksum values are different the one or more data blocks or parity blocks is not reconstructed properly. The RAID controller or the access management system may select other available algorithms to recover the one or more data blocks or parity blocks.

At step selected files or all received files may be grouped together under a leaf directory. In some embodiments a non leaf directory is implemented to group selected files or all received files for RAID process. At step all files under the leaf directory are grouped into one or more data stripes. Each data stripe may consist of a plurality of data blocks i.e. data blocks with the same or different sizes of data. At step for each data stripe a predetermined number of parity blocks are generated. All parity blocks corresponding to the two or more files are then concatenated into one parity file at step . At step the data blocks and parity blocks corresponding to the two or more files in the leaf directory are written to separate partitions and or separate storage drives of the database .

While the method of is described in the context of a single database the present disclosure contemplates a plurality of synchronous databases. The plurality of synchronous databases can be located at a single location or a variety of locations.

With particular types of memory devices such a physical transformation may comprise a physical transformation of an article to a different state or thing. For example but without limitation for some types of memory devices a change in state may involve an accumulation and storage of charge or a release of stored charge. Likewise in other memory devices a change of state may comprise a physical change or transformation in magnetic orientation or a physical change or transformation in molecular structure such as from crystalline to amorphous or vice versa. The foregoing is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all examples in which a change in state for a binary one to a binary zero or vice versa in a memory device may comprise a transformation such as a physical transformation. Rather the foregoing are intended as illustrative examples.

A storage medium typically may be non transitory or comprise a non transitory device. In this context a non transitory storage medium may include a device that is tangible meaning that the device has a concrete physical form although the device may change its physical state. Thus for example non transitory refers to a device remaining tangible despite this change in state.

The computer may be but is not limited to a server computer a client computer a personal computer PC a tablet PC a laptop computer a set top box STB a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular telephone an iPhone an iPad a processor a telephone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine.

In alternative embodiments the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines. In a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in a client server network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment.

Some portions of the detailed description may be presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as processing or computing or calculating or determining or displaying or generating or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the methods of some embodiments. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition the techniques are not described with reference to any particular programming language and various embodiments may thus be implemented using a variety of programming languages.

In general the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the disclosure may be implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as programs. The programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processing units or processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations to execute elements involving the various aspects of the disclosure.

Moreover while embodiments have been described in the context of fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms and that the disclosure applies equally regardless of the particular type of computer readable medium used to actually effect the distribution.

Unless the context clearly requires otherwise throughout the description and the claims the words comprise comprising and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense that is to say in the sense of including but is not limited to. As used herein the terms connected coupled or any variant thereof means any connection or coupling either direct or indirect between two or more elements the coupling of connection between the elements can be physical logical or a combination thereof. Additionally the words herein above below and words of similar import when used in this application shall refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. Where the context permits words in the above Detailed Description using the singular or plural number may also include the plural or singular number respectively. The word or in reference to a list of two or more items covers all the following interpretations of the word any of the items in the list all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list.

The above detailed description of embodiments of the disclosure is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the teachings to the precise form disclosed above. While specific embodiments of and examples for the disclosure are described above for illustrative purposes various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the disclosure as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize. For example while processes or blocks are presented in a given order alternative embodiments may perform routines having steps or employ systems having blocks in a different order and some processes or blocks may be deleted moved added subdivided combined and or modified to provide alternative or sub combinations. Each of these processes or blocks may be implemented in a variety of different ways. Also while processes or blocks are at times shown as being performed in series these processes or blocks may instead be performed in parallel or may be performed at different times. Further any specific numbers noted herein are only examples alternative implementations may employ differing values or ranges.

The teaching of the disclosure provided herein can be applied to other systems and not necessarily to the system described above. Any patents and applications and other references noted above including any that may be listed in accompanying filing papers are incorporated herein by reference. Aspects of the disclosure can be modified if necessary to employ the systems functions and concepts of the various references described above to provide yet further embodiments of the disclosure.
