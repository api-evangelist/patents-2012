Despite the ubiquitous presence of automobiles and airplanes railway trains still remain an important means of transportation for both passengers and cargo. Each day thousands of trains travel across diverse routes and some over great distances along railroad tracks. While traveling these routes trains may encounter numerous railroad crossings or junctions where the railroad tracks intersect a roadway. In most cases flashing lights boom barriers and other warning systems devices are used to notify vehicles and pedestrians of approaching trains at a particular railroad crossing. However the approximate arrival time of train and the approximate duration for clearing these railroad crossings are not readily known in advance such that emergency security freight passenger and other vehicles may plan alternate travel routes.

The following discussion is directed to various embodiments. Although one or more of these embodiments may be discussed in detail the embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted or otherwise used as limiting the scope of the disclosure including the claims. In addition one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be an example of that embodiment and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure including the claims is limited to that embodiment. Furthermore as used herein the designators A B and N particularly with respect to the reference numerals in the drawings indicate that a number of the particular feature so designated can be included with examples of the present disclosure. The designators can represent the same or different numbers of the particular features.

In addition the proportion and the relative scale of the elements provided in the figures are intended to illustrate the examples of the present disclosure and should not be taken in a limiting sense.

Some prior solutions provide a method for analyzing and determining the arrival time of a train at future passenger or freight drop off and pickup destinations. However these solutions are primarily directed towards various train stoppage and or unload points rather than non stop roadway intersection positions and also does not account for the length of the train in determining the estimated time for clearing a particular traffic intersection. Still other solutions disclose a method for directly communicating data to suitably equipped rail road crossing devices which are configured to display the train arrival information through use of flashing lights and other display means so as to visually alert nearby pedestrians and motorists of a time interval during which it is safe to cross the rail road crossing. However there remains a need in the art to make available the estimated arrival time of trains at railroad crossings and the length of time it will take each train to pass through these crossings to a wider audience so that such information may be taken into account when planning trips.

Examples of the present invention disclose a train traffic advising system and method thereof. According to one example embodiment the train traffic advising system includes a train configured to communicate with a train traffic advisor application hosted by a data center. More particularly the train traffic advisor is configured to collect train data continuously and for a plurality of trains in a data center and then to communicate train traffic information to various clients or subscribers of that data. As a result motorists and pedestrians alike can utilize examples of the present invention in order to avoid identified train traffic hazards and help ease the flow of traffic along busy roadways and intersections.

Referring now in more detail to the drawings in which like numerals identify corresponding parts throughout the views is a simplified illustration of the train traffic advising system according to an example of the present invention. As shown here the train traffic advising system includes a communication device a train or plurality of trains a data center and a plurality of subscriber devices . The communication device represents a wireless transmission device for facilitating telecommunication between the data center train and subscribers and may include a telecommunication satellite cellular telephone tower and the like. As used herein train represents a railway or railroad train having a connected set of vehicles configured to move along a track for transportation of freight and or passengers from one place to another. The train may represent a freight train monorail train high speed rail train commuter train tram rubber tired underground train Maglev or similar transport vehicle that travels along a railway and intersects a public thoroughfare. Data center represents a centralized location for receiving train status information from multiple railway trains and also for forwarding train traffic information to subscribing devices . More specifically subscribers represent vehicles computing devices railroad crossings and or communication channels registered to receive train traffic information from the train traffic advisor application as will be described in further detail below.

In accordance with an example of the present embodiment the data center includes a communication module a web service application programming interface API a train traffic advisor application and databases for storing train crossing data subscriber data and train status information . The communication module represents a wireless communication means for transmitting and receiving data. Programming interface represents a web service application programming interface or similar interface capable of being accessed securely over the internet or across the network. The train traffic advisor application represents a processing unit or software application configured to analyze train status information e.g. train length train speed acceleration train location along with stored train crossing data relating to the position of railroad crossings across a geographical area in order to compute train traffic information. More particularly the data center and advisor application may collect train status information continuously and for a plurality of trains. In one instance the train traffic information details the arrival time and clearance time for a particular train at a particular railroad crossing. The train traffic information pertaining to one or more trains is then communicated and or broadcast to a vehicle subscriber and or other subscriber devices systems identified from the subscriber database .

The vehicle subscriber may include a GPS receiver a communication module a speed monitoring module navigation system and a vehicle control unit . In the present example embodiment the vehicle control unit represents a central processor for the collection and processing of the instantaneous speed via data returned from the speed monitor module and GPS position via positional data from the GPS receiver of the vehicle . This data may be utilized by the vehicle control unit or the train advisor application to derive the travel direction and possible route of the vehicle. Alternatively an on board navigation system may be used to provide details of the vehicle s travel route.

Still further the data center train traffic advisor application may be configured to make the train traffic information available through multiple channels including a web service available to subscribing organizations and or a synthesized voice radio broadcast that could supply the train railroad crossing information to FM channels per geographical area. Moreover the synthesized voice channel may be used in conjunction with an Interactive Voice Response WR computer telephony system to supply the train traffic information in a self service manner. A third publication or advising scenario may involve the built in navigational system of a vehicle automatically acquiring railroad crossing information via proprietary third party channels. Or alternatively the in vehicle telematics or navigational system may directly acquire the train traffic information by accessing the data center s web service API . Depending on the driver s preferences and modalities of usage the telematics system may proactively advise the user via voice or on the display screen of the railroad crossings in the vicinity of the vehicle and a status thereof

Alternatively the driver of a vehicle may call an IVR unit using a portable electronic device e.g. smartphone and inquire about any railroad crossing within the vicinity and the estimated time of arrival of any trains going through these crossings. The IVR through embedded voice menu options and or a speech recognition subsystem for example may retrieve the railroad crossing data and communicate it through synthesized speech to the caller. Another example may involve the caller device furnishing the GPS data and or the instantaneous speed of the vehicle through a built in GPS unit on the portable electronic device e.g. smartphone stand alone GPS unit .

Also within in a web service scenario a service provider e.g. GM OnStar may retrieve the railroad crossing information for all the trains and all the railroad crossings in a particular region e.g. west coast on a regular basis. The train traffic information may then be stored in service provider s databases such that service provider subscribers may access this information through the train traffic advisor application hosted by the service provider. When a subscriber calls the service provider the train traffic advisor application may the look up the subscriber s position instantaneous speed and travel direction may be computed and then advise the subscriber of any trains going through railroad crossings within the subscriber s travel route based on computed present location and speed data .

Example embodiments of the present invention provide a train traffic advisor system and method thereof. Moreover many advantages are afforded by the train traffic advisor system according to embodiments of the present invention. For instance the present system serves to ease the flow of traffic along roadways by publishing or otherwise making available train status information at a particular railroad crossing. Motorists and particularly emergency and security vehicles operating in large cities can thus prepare for any possible traffic congestion or delays caused by the arrival of a lengthy railway train at railroad crossing within the vehicle s travel path.

Furthermore while the invention has been described with respect to example embodiments one skilled in the art will recognize that numerous modifications are possible. For example one possible modification is to add one additional radio transceiver that is suitably selected and installed on the train to broadcast synthesized voice messages on FM AM CB and other frequencies from the train. The voice broadcast may state the length of the train the estimated time it will take for that train to clear the nearest junction s or railroad crossing and the location of the junction s . This message may be repeated until updated by information regarding the length speed and position for the next junction s or until the train has cleared that particular crossing. The frequencies of these public messages may be published and publically available so that a driver may hear these messages e.g. via a radio receiver unit and make travel route decisions in addition to aiding in the safety of pedestrians and drivers who cross these junctions. In such a configuration the data processing and collection unit of the train may be configured to also compute based on the current GPS data or accelerometer and or encoder data as well as internal maps of the railroad crossings of the United States the nearest train junctions and the estimated time of arrival at these crossing. This computation may be accomplished via comparison of the real time position of the train with geo spatial maps that are stored and updated and available to the train s data processing unit. In addition to the data processing and collect unit a software module may be included within the train to transform the data into synthesized speech and to prepare and execute a radio broadcast schedule.

Still further the train could run a web server and publish a web services API so that individual agents could then program to that API and get train status information directly from the train. These agents could be embedded kiosk like systems attached to the existing railroad crossings. In this manner intelligent railroad crossings could inform others about the estimated time of arrival for upcoming trains and the estimated length of time it will take the train to clear the crossing. In this scenario the information could be delivered to the vehicles via short range CB or FM channels or to a subscribing user s portable electronic device e.g. cell phone via a text message from the intelligent railroad crossing.

Moreover examples of the present invention may implemented for ships boats or similar watercraft vehicles for advising subscribers with respect to the estimated arrival and clearance time of the watercraft vehicle at nearby suspension bridges. Thus although the invention has been described with respect to exemplary embodiments it will be appreciated that the invention is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the following claims.
