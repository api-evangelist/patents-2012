This application claims the benefit of U.S. Prov. App. No. 61 680 989 filed on Aug. 8 2012 and U.S. Prov. App. No. 61 719 874 filed on Oct. 29 2012. The entire content of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.

This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13 314 337 filed on Dec. 8 2011 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. References to items in the singular should be understood to include items in the plural and vice versa unless explicitly stated otherwise or clear from the text. Grammatical conjunctions are intended to express any and all disjunctive and conjunctive combinations of conjoined clauses sentences words and the like unless otherwise stated or clear from the context. Thus the term or should generally be understood to mean and or and so forth.

The following description emphasizes three dimensional printers using fused deposition modeling or similar techniques where a bead of material is extruded in a layered series of two dimensional patterns as roads paths or the like to form a three dimensional object from a digital model. It will be understood however that numerous additive fabrication techniques are known in the art including without limitation multijet printing stereolithography Digital Light Processor DLP three dimensional printing selective laser sintering and so forth. Such techniques may benefit from the systems and methods described below and all such printing technologies are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure and within the scope of terms such as printer three dimensional printer fabrication system and so forth unless a more specific meaning is explicitly provided or otherwise clear from the context.

The build platform may include a surface that is rigid and substantially planar. The surface may provide a fixed dimensionally and positionally stable platform on which to build the object . The build platform may include a thermal element that controls the temperature of the build platform through one or more active devices such as resistive elements that convert electrical current into heat Peltier effect devices that can create a heating or cooling affect or any other thermoelectric heating and or cooling devices. The thermal element may be coupled in a communicating relationship with the controller in order for the controller to controllably impart heat to or remove heat from the surface of the build platform .

The extruder may include a chamber in an interior thereof to receive a build material. The build material may for example include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS high density polyethylene HDPL polylactic acid PLA or any other suitable plastic thermoplastic or other material that can usefully be extruded to form a three dimensional object. The extruder may include an extrusion tip or other opening that includes an exit port with a circular oval slotted or other cross sectional profile that extrudes build material in a desired cross sectional shape.

The extruder may include a heater also referred to as a heating element to melt thermoplastic or other meltable build materials within the chamber for extrusion through an extrusion tip in liquid form. While illustrated in block form it will be understood that the heater may include e.g. coils of resistive wire wrapped about the extruder one or more heating blocks with resistive elements to heat the extruder with applied current an inductive heater or any other arrangement of heating elements suitable for creating heat within the chamber sufficient to melt the build material for extrusion. The extruder may also or instead include a motor or the like to push the build material into the chamber and or through the extrusion tip .

In general operation and by way of example rather than limitation a build material such as ABS plastic in filament form may be fed into the chamber from a spool or the like by the motor melted by the heater and extruded from the extrusion tip . By controlling a rate of the motor the temperature of the heater and or other process parameters the build material may be extruded at a controlled volumetric rate. It will be understood that a variety of techniques may also or instead be employed to deliver build material at a controlled volumetric rate which may depend upon the type of build material the volumetric rate desired and any other factors. All such techniques that might be suitably adapted to delivery of build material for fabrication of a three dimensional object are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.

The x y z positioning assembly may generally be adapted to three dimensionally position the extruder and the extrusion tip within the working volume . Thus by controlling the volumetric rate of delivery for the build material and the x y z position of the extrusion tip the object may be fabricated in three dimensions by depositing successive layers of material in two dimensional patterns derived for example from cross sections of a computer model or other computerized representation of the object . A variety of arrangements and techniques are known in the art to achieve controlled linear movement along one or more axes. The x y z positioning assembly may for example include a number of stepper motors to independently control a position of the extruder within the working volume along each of an x axis a y axis and a z axis. More generally the x y z positioning assembly may include without limitation various combinations of stepper motors encoded DC motors gears belts pulleys worm gears threads and so forth. For example in one aspect the build platform may be coupled to one or more threaded rods by a threaded nut so that the threaded rods can be rotated to provide z axis positioning of the build platform relative to the extruder . This arrangement may advantageously simplify design and improve accuracy by permitting an x y positioning mechanism for the extruder to be fixed relative to a build volume. Any such arrangement suitable for controllably positioning the extruder within the working volume may be adapted to use with the printer described herein.

In general this may include moving the extruder or moving the build platform or some combination of these. Thus it will be appreciated that any reference to moving an extruder relative to a build platform working volume or object is intended to include movement of the extruder or movement of the build platform or both unless a more specific meaning is explicitly provided or otherwise clear from the context. Still more generally while an x y z coordinate system serves as a convenient basis for positioning within three dimensions any other coordinate system or combination of coordinate systems may also or instead be employed such as a positional controller and assembly that operates according to cylindrical or spherical coordinates.

The controller may be electrically or otherwise coupled in a communicating relationship with the build platform the x y z positioning assembly and the other various components of the printer . In general the controller is operable to control the components of the printer such as the build platform the x y z positioning assembly and any other components of the printer described herein to fabricate the object from the build material. The controller may include any combination of software and or processing circuitry suitable for controlling the various components of the printer described herein including without limitation microprocessors microcontrollers application specific integrated circuits programmable gate arrays and any other digital and or analog components as well as combinations of the foregoing along with inputs and outputs for transceiving control signals drive signals power signals sensor signals and so forth. In one aspect this may include circuitry directly and physically associated with the printer such as an on board processor. In another aspect this may be a processor associated with a personal computer or other computing device coupled to the printer e.g. through a wired or wireless connection. Similarly various functions described herein may be allocated between an on board processor for the printer and a separate computer. All such computing devices and environments are intended to fall within the meaning of the term controller or processor as used herein unless a different meaning is explicitly provided or otherwise clear from the context.

A variety of additional sensors and other components may be usefully incorporated into the printer described above. These other components are generically depicted as other hardware in for which the positioning and mechanical electrical interconnections with other elements of the printer will be readily understood and appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. The other hardware may include a temperature sensor positioned to sense a temperature of the surface of the build platform the extruder or any other system components. This may for example include a thermistor or the like embedded within or attached below the surface of the build platform . This may also or instead include an infrared detector or the like directed at the surface of the build platform .

In another aspect the other hardware may include a sensor to detect a presence of the object at a predetermined location. This may include an optical detector arranged in a beam breaking configuration to sense the presence of the object at a predetermined location. This may also or instead include an imaging device and image processing circuitry to capture an image of the working volume and to analyze the image to evaluate a position of the object . This sensor may be used for example to ensure that the object is removed from the build platform prior to beginning a new build on the working surface . Thus the sensor may be used to determine whether an object is present that should not be or to detect when an object is absent. The feedback from this sensor may be used by the controller to issue processing interrupts or otherwise control operation of the printer .

The other hardware may also or instead include a heating element instead of or in addition to the thermal element to heat the working volume such as a radiant heater or forced hot air heater to maintain the object at a fixed elevated temperature throughout a build or the other hardware may include a cooling element to cool the working volume.

The data network may be any network s or internetwork s suitable for communicating data and control information among participants in the environment . This may include public networks such as the Internet private networks telecommunications networks such as the Public Switched Telephone Network or cellular networks using third generation e.g. 3G or IMT 2000 fourth generation e.g. LTE E UTRA or WiMax Advanced IEEE 802.16m and or other technologies as well as any of a variety of corporate area or local area networks and other switches routers hubs gateways and the like that might be used to carry data among participants in the environment .

The three dimensional printers may be any computer controlled devices for three dimensional fabrication including without limitation any of the three dimensional printers or other fabrication or prototyping devices described above. In general each such device may include a network interface comprising e.g. a network interface card which term is used broadly herein to include any hardware along with software firmware or the like to control operation of same suitable for establishing and maintaining wired and or wireless communications. The network interface card may include without limitation wired Ethernet network interface cards NICs wireless 802.11 networking cards wireless 802.11 USB devices or other hardware for wireless local area networking. The network interface may also or instead include cellular network hardware wide area wireless network hardware or any other hardware for centralized ad hoc peer to peer or other radio communications that might be used to carry data. In another aspect the network interface may include a serial or USB port to directly connect to a computing device such as a desktop computer that in turn provides more general network connectivity to the data network .

The printers might be made to fabricate any object practical or otherwise that is amenable to fabrication according to each printer s capabilities. This may be a model of a house or a tea cup as depicted or any other object such as a bunny gears or other machine hardware replications of scanned three dimensional objects or fanciful works of art.

Client devices may be any devices within the environment operated by users to initiate manage monitor or otherwise interact with print jobs at the three dimensional printers . This may include desktop computers laptop computers network computers tablets or any other computing device that can participate in the environment as contemplated herein. Each client device generally provides a user interface which may include a graphical user interface a text or command line interface a voice controlled interface and or a gesture based interface to control operation of remote three dimensional printers . The user interface may be maintained by a locally executing application on one of the client devices that receives data and status information from e.g. the printers and print servers concerning pending or executing print jobs. The user interface may create a suitable display on the client device for user interaction. In other embodiments the user interface may be remotely served and presented on one of the client devices such as where a print server or one of the three dimensional printers includes a web server that provides information through one or more web pages or the like that can be displayed within a web browser or similar client executing on one of the client devices . In one aspect the user interface may include a voice controlled interface that receives spoken commands from a user and or provides spoken feedback to the user.

The print servers may include data storage a network interface and a processor and or other processing circuitry. In the following description where the functions or configuration of a print server are described this is intended to include corresponding functions or configuration e.g. by programming of a processor of the print server . In general the print servers or processors thereof may perform a variety of processing tasks related to management of networked printing. For example the print servers may manage print jobs received from one or more of the client devices and provide related supporting functions such as content search and management. A print server may also include a web server that provides web based access by the client devices to the capabilities of the print server . A print server may also communicate periodically with three dimensional printers in order to obtain status information concerning e.g. availability of printers and or the status of particular print jobs any of which may be subsequently presented to a user through the web server or any other suitable interface. A print server may also maintain a list of available three dimensional printers and may automatically select one of the three dimensional printers for a user submitted print job or may permit a user to specify a single printer or a group of preferred printers for fabricating an object. Where the print server selects the printer automatically any number of criteria may be used such as geographical proximity printing capabilities current print queue fees if any for use of a particular three dimensional printer and so forth. Where the user specifies criteria this may similarly include any relevant aspects of three dimensional printers and may permit use of absolute criteria e.g. filters or preferences which may be weighted preferences or unweighted preferences any of which may be used by a print server to allocate a print job to a suitable resource.

In one aspect the print server may be configured to support interactive voice control of one of the printers . For example the print server may be configured to receive a voice signal e.g. in digitized audio form from a microphone or other audio input of the printer and to process the voice signal to extract relevant content such as a command for the printer. Where the command is recognized as a print command the voice signal may be further processed to extract additional context or relevant details. For example the voice signal may be processed to extract an object identifier that specifies an object for printing e.g. by filename file metadata or semantic content. The voice signal may also be processed to extract a dimensional specification such as a scale or absolute dimension for an object. The print server may then generate suitable control signals for return to the printer to cause the printer to fabricate the object. Where an error or omission is detected the print server may return a request for clarification to the printer which may render the request in spoken form through a speaker or within a user interface of the printer or an associated device.

Other user preferences may be usefully stored at the print server to facilitate autonomous unsupervised fabrication of content from content sources . For example a print server may store a user s preference on handling objects greater than a build volume of a printer. These preferences may control whether to resize the object whether to break the object into multiple sub objects for fabrication and whether to transmit multiple sub objects to a single printer or multiple printers. In addition user preferences or requirements may be stored such as multi color printing capability build material options and capabilities and so forth. More generally a print queue which may be a printer specific or user specific queue and which may be hosted at a printer a server or some combination of these may be managed by a print server according to one or more criteria from a remote user requesting a print job. The print server may also store user preferences or criteria for filtering content e.g. for automatic printing or other handling. While this is described below as a feature for autonomous operation of a printer such as a printer that locally subscribes to a syndicated model source any criteria that can be used to identify models of potential interest by explicit type e.g. labeled in model metadata implicit type e.g. determined based on analysis of the model source and so forth may be provided to the print server and used to automatically direct new content to one or more user specified ones of the three dimensional printers .

In the context of voice controlled printing the print server may usefully store user specific data such as training for a voice recognition model. The print server may also or instead store voice rendering data to use in generating spoken output by the printer . This may for example include voice type data voice model data voice sample data and so forth. Thus for example a user may purchase or otherwise obtain a voice style e.g. a celebrity voice or other personality to render spoken commands and maintain the voice style on the print server . The print server may also or instead store data characterizing capabilities of the printer so that voice commands received at the print server can be analyzed for suitability accuracy and so forth according to the capabilities of the printer from which the voice command was received. More generally any data or processing for voice interaction that can be usefully stored or executed remotely from the printer may be located at the printer server . It will be understood that any such data may also or instead be stored on a client device a printer or some combination of these.

In one aspect the processor of the print server may be configured to store a plurality of print jobs submitted to the web server in a log and to provide an analysis of print activity based on the log. This may include any type of analysis that might be useful to participants in the environment . For example the analysis may include tracking of the popularity of particular objects or of particular content sources. The analysis may include tracking of which three dimensional printers are most popular or least popular or related statistics such as the average backlog of pending print jobs at a number of the three dimensional printers . The analysis may include success of a particular printer in fabricating a particular model or of a particular printer in completing print jobs generally. More generally any statistics or data may be obtained and any analysis may be performed that might be useful to users e.g. when requesting prints content sources e.g. when choosing new printable objects for publication providers of fabrication resources e.g. when setting fees or network facilitators such as the print servers .

A print server may also maintain a database of content along with an interface for users at client devices to search the database and request fabrication of objects in the database using any of the three dimensional printers . Thus in one aspect a print server or any system including the print server may include a database of three dimensional models and the print server may act as a server that provides a search engine for locating a particular three dimensional model in the database . The search engine may be a text based search engine using keyword text queries plain language queries and so forth. The search engine may also or instead include an image based search engine configured to identify three dimensional models similar to a two dimensional or three dimensional image provide by a user.

In another aspect the printer server may periodically search for suitable content at remote locations on the data network which content may be retrieved to the database or have its remote location e.g. a URL or other network location identifier stored in the database . In another aspect the print server may provide an interface for submission of objects from remote users along with any suitable metadata such as a title tags creator information descriptive narrative pictures recommended printer settings and so forth. In one aspect the database may be manually curated according to any desired standards. In another aspect printable objects in the database may be manually or automatically annotated according to content type popularity editorial commentary and so forth.

The print server may more generally provide a variety of management functions. For example the print server may store a location of a predetermined alternative three dimensional printer to execute a print job from a remote user in the event of a failure by the one of the plurality of three dimensional printers . In another aspect the print server may maintain exclusive control over at least one of the plurality of three dimensional printers such that other users and or print servers cannot control the printer. In another aspect the print server may submit a print job to a first available one of the plurality of three dimensional printers .

In another aspect a print server may provide an interface for managing subscriptions to sources of content. This may include tools for searching existing subscriptions locating or specifying new sources subscribing to sources of content and so forth. In one aspect a print server may manage subscriptions and automatically direct new content from these subscriptions to a three dimensional printer according to any user specified criteria. Thus while it is contemplated that a three dimensional printer may autonomously subscribe to sources of content through a network interface and receive new content directly from such sources it is also contemplated that this feature may be maintained through a remote resource such as a print server .

A print server may maintain print queues for participating three dimensional printers . This approach may advantageously alleviate backlogs at individual printers which may have limited memory capacity for pending print jobs. More generally a print server may by communicating with multiple three dimensional printers obtain a view of utilization of multiple networked resources that permits a more efficient allocation of print jobs than would be possible through simple point to point communications among users and printers. Print queues may also be published by a print server so that users can view pending queues for a variety of different three dimensional printers prior to selecting a resource for a print job. In one aspect the print queue may be published as a number of print jobs and size of print jobs so that a requester can evaluate likely delays. In another aspect the print queue may be published as an estimated time until a newly submitted print job can be initiated.

In one aspect the print queue of one of the print servers may include one or more print jobs for one of the plurality of three dimensional printers . The print queue may be stored locally at the one of the plurality of three dimensional printers. In another aspect the print queue may be allocated between the database and a local memory of the three dimensional printer . In another aspect the print queue may be stored for example in the database of the print server . As used here the term print queue is intended to include print data e.g. the three dimensional model or tool instructions to fabricate an object for a number of print job which may be arranged for presentation in order of expected execution as well as any metadata concerning print jobs. Thus a portion of the print queue such as the metadata e.g. size status time to completion may be usefully communicated to a print server for sharing among users while another portion of the print queue such as the model data may be stored at a printer in preparation for execution of a print job.

Print queues may implement various user preferences on prioritization. For example for a commercial enterprise longer print jobs may be deferred for after normal hours of operation e.g. after 5 00 p.m. while shorter print jobs may be executed first if they can be completed before the end of a business day. In this manner objects can be identified and fabricated from within the print queue in a manner that permits as many objects as possible to be fabricated before a predetermined closing time. Similarly commercial providers of fabrication services may charge explicitly for prioritized fabrication and implement this prioritization by prioritizing print queues in a corresponding fashion.

In another aspect a print server may provide a virtual workspace for a user. In this virtual workspace a user may search local or remote databases of printable objects save objects of interest or links thereto manage pending prints specify preferences for receiving status updates e.g. by electronic mail or SMS text manage subscriptions to content search for new subscription sources and so forth. In one aspect the virtual workspace may be or may include web based design tools or a web based design interface that permits a user to create and modify models. In one aspect the virtual workspace may be deployed on the web while permitting direct fabrication of a model developed within that environment on a user specified one of the three dimensional printers thus enabling a web based design environment that is directly coupled to one or more fabrication resources.

The content sources may include any sources of content for fabrication with a three dimensional printer . This may for example include databases of objects accessible through a web interface or application programming interface. This may also or instead include individual desktop computers or the like configured as a server for hosted access or configured to operate as a peer in a peer to peer network. This may also or instead include content subscription services which may be made available in an unrestricted fashion or may be made available on a paid subscription basis or on an authenticated basis based upon some other relationship e.g. purchase of a related product or a ticket to an event . It will be readily appreciated that any number of content providers may serve as content sources as contemplated herein. By way of non limiting example the content sources may include destinations such as amusement parks museums theaters performance venues or the like any of which may provide content related to users who purchase tickets. The content sources may include manufacturers such as automobile computer consumer electronics or home appliance manufacturers any of which may provide content related to upgrades maintenance repair or other support of existing products that have been purchased. The content sources may include artists or other creative enterprises that sell various works of interest. The content sources may include engineering or architectural firms that provide marketing or advertising pieces to existing or prospective customers. The content sources may include marketing or advertising firms that provide promotional items for clients. More generally the content sources may be any individual or enterprise that provides single or serial objects for fabrication by the three dimensional printers described herein.

One or more web servers may provide web based access to and from any of the other participants in the environment . While depicted as a separate network entity it will be readily appreciated that a web server may be logically or physically associated with one of the other devices described herein and may for example provide a user interface for web access to one of the three dimensional printers one of the print servers or databases coupled thereto one of the content sources or any of the other resources described below in a manner that permits user interaction through the data network e.g. from a client device or mobile device .

The mobile devices may be any form of mobile device such as any wireless battery powered device that might be used to interact with the networked printing environment . The mobile devices may for example include laptop computers tablets thin client network computers portable digital assistants messaging devices cellular phones smart phones portable media or entertainment devices and so forth. In general mobile devices may be operated by users for a variety of user oriented functions such as to locate printable objects to submit objects for printing to monitor a personally owned printer and or to monitor a pending print job. A mobile device may include location awareness technology such as Global Positioning System GPS which may obtain information that can be usefully integrated into a printing operation in a variety of ways. For example a user may select an object for printing and submit a model of the object to a print server such as any of the print servers described above. The print server may determine a location of the mobile device initiating the print job and locate a closest printer for fabrication of the object.

In another aspect a printing function may be location based using the GPS input or cellular network triangulation proximity detection or any other suitable location detection techniques . For example a user may be authorized to print a model only when the user is near a location e.g. within a geo fenced area or otherwise proximal to a location or only after a user has visited a location. Thus a user may be provided with printable content based upon locations that the user has visited or while within a certain venue such as an amusement park museum theater sports arena hotel or the like. Similarly a matrix barcode such as a QR code may be employed for localization.

The other resources may include any other software or hardware resources that may be usefully employed in networked printing applications as contemplated herein. For example the other resources may include payment processing servers or platforms used to authorize payment for content subscriptions content purchases or printing resources. As another example the other resources may include social networking platforms that may be used e.g. to share three dimensional models and or fabrication results according to a user s social graph. In another aspect the other resources may include certificate servers or other security resources for third party verification of identity encryption or decryption of three dimensional models and so forth. In another aspect the other resources may include online tools for three dimensional design or modeling as well as databases of objects surface textures build supplies and so forth. In another aspect the other resources may include a desktop computer or the like co located e.g. on the same local area network with or directly coupled to through a serial or USB cable with one of the three dimensional printers . In this case the other resource may provide supplemental functions for the three dimensional printer in a networked printing context such as maintaining a print queue or operating a web server for remote interaction with the three dimensional printer . Other resources also include supplemental resources such as three dimensional scanners cameras and post processing finishing machines or resources. More generally any resource that might be usefully integrated into a networked printing environment may be one of the resources as contemplated herein.

It will be readily appreciated that the various components of the networked printing environment described above may be arranged and configured to support networked printing in a variety of ways. For example in one aspect there is disclosed herein a networked computer with a print server and a web interface to support networked three dimensional printing. This device may include a print server a database and a web server as discussed above. The print server may be coupled through a data network to a plurality of three dimensional printers and configured to receive status information from one or more sensors for each one of the plurality of three dimensional printers. The print server may be further configured to manage a print queue for each one of the plurality of three dimensional printers. The database may be coupled in a communicating relationship with the print server and configured to store print queue data and status information for each one of the plurality of three dimensional printers. The web server may be configured to provide a user interface over the data network to a remote user the user interface adapted to present the status information and the print queue data for one or more of the plurality of three dimensional printers to the user and the user interface adapted to receive a print job from the remote user for one of the plurality of three dimensional printers.

The three dimensional printer described above may be configured to autonomously subscribe to syndicated content sources and periodically receive and print objects from those sources. Thus in one aspect there is disclosed herein a device including any of the three dimensional printers described above a network interface and a processor which may without limitation include the controller for the printer . The processor may be configured to subscribe to a plurality of sources of content such as the content sources described above selected by a user for fabrication by the three dimensional printer through the network interface. The processor may be further configured to receive one or more three dimensional models from the plurality of content sources and to select one of the one or more three dimensional models for fabrication by the three dimensional printer according to a user preference for prioritization. The user preference may for example preferentially prioritize particular content sources or particular types of content e.g. tools games artwork upgrade parts or content related to a particular interest of the user .

The memory of a three dimensional printer may be configured to store a queue of one or more additional three dimensional models not selected for immediate fabrication. The processor may be programmed to periodically re order or otherwise alter the queue according to pre determined criteria or manual user input. For example the processor may be configured to evaluate a new three dimensional model based upon a user preference for prioritization and to place the new three dimensional model at a corresponding position in the queue. The processor may also or instead be configured to retrieve content from one of the content sources by providing authorization credentials for the user which may be stored at the three dimensional printer or otherwise accessible for presentation to the content source . The processor may be configured to retrieve content from at least one of the plurality of content sources by authorizing a payment from the user to a content provider. The processor may be configured to search a second group of sources of content such as any of the content sources described above according to one or more search criteria provide by a user. This may also or instead include demographic information for the user contextual information for the user or any other implicit or explicit user information.

In another aspect there is disclosed herein a system for managing subscriptions to three dimensional content sources such as any of the content sources described above. The system may include a web server configured to provide a user interface over a data network which user interface is adapted to receive user preferences from a user including a subscription to a plurality of sources of a plurality of three dimensional models a prioritization of content from the plurality of sources and an identification of one or more fabrication resources coupled to the data network and suitable for fabricating objects from the plurality of three dimensional models. The system may also include a database to store the user preferences and to receive and store the plurality of three dimensional models as they are issued by the plurality of sources. The system may include a processor e.g. of a print server or alternatively of a client device interacting with the print server configured to select one of the plurality of three dimensional models for fabrication based upon the prioritization. The system may include a print server configured to communicate with the one or more fabrication resources through the data network to determine an availability of the one or more fabrication resources and to transmit the selected one of the plurality of three dimensional models to one of the one or more fabrication resources.

In another aspect there is disclosed herein a network of three dimensional printing resources comprising a plurality of three dimensional printers each one of the plurality of three dimensional printers including a network interface a server configured to manage execution of a plurality of print jobs by the plurality of three dimensional printers and a data network that couples the server and the plurality of three dimensional printers in a communicating relationship.

In general as described above the server may include a web based user interface configured for a user to submit a new print job to the server and to monitor progress of the new print job. The web based user interface may permit video monitoring of each one of the plurality of three dimensional printers or otherwise provide information useful to a remote user including image based simulation based textual based or other information concerning status of a current print. The web based user interface may include voice input and or output for network based voice control of a printer.

The fabrication resources may for example include any of the three dimensional printers described above. One or more of the fabrication resources may be a private fabrication resource secured with a credential based access system. The user may provide as a user preference and prior to use of the private fabrication resource credentials for accessing the private fabrication resource. In another aspect the one or more fabrication resources may include a commercial fabrication resource. In this case the user may provide an authorization to pay for use of the commercial fabrication resource in the form of a user preference prior to use of the commercial fabrication resource.

Many current three dimensional printers require significant manufacturing time to fabricate an object. At the same time certain printers may include a tool or system to enable multiple sequential object prints without human supervision or intervention such as a conveyor belt. In this context prioritizing content may be particularly important to prevent crowding out of limited fabrication resources with low priority content that arrives periodically for autonomous fabrication. As a significant advantage the systems and methods described herein permit prioritization using a variety of user specified criteria and permit use of multiple fabrication resources in appropriate circumstances. Thus prioritizing content as contemplated herein may include any useful form of prioritization. For example this may include prioritizing the content according to source. The content sources may have an explicit type that specifies the nature of the source e.g. commercial or paid content promotional content product support content non commercial or the type of content provided e.g. automotive consumer electronics radio control hobbyist contest prizes and so forth . Prioritizing content may include prioritizing the content according to this type. The three dimensional models themselves may also or instead include a type e.g. tool game home art jewelry replacement part upgrade part etc. or any other metadata and prioritizing the content may includes prioritizing the content according to this type and or metadata.

In one aspect the processor may be configured to select two or more of the plurality of three dimensional models for concurrent fabrication by two or more of the plurality of fabrication resources based upon the prioritization when a priority of the two or more of the plurality of three dimensional models exceeds a predetermined threshold. That is where particular models individually have a priority above the predetermined threshold multiple fabrication resources may be located and employed to fabricate these models concurrently. The predetermined threshold may be evaluated for each model individually or for all of the models collectively such as on an aggregate or average basis.

In one aspect the processor may be configured to adjust prioritization based upon a history of fabrication when a number of objects fabricated from one of the plurality of sources exceeds a predetermined threshold. Thus for example a user may limit the number of objects fabricated from a particular source giving subsequent priority to content from other sources regardless of an objectively determined priority for a new object from the particular source. This prevents a single source from overwhelming a single fabrication resource such as a personal three dimensional printer operated by the user in a manner that crowds out other content from other sources of possible interest. At the same time this may enable content sources to publish on any convenient schedule without regard to whether and how subscribers will be able to fabricate objects.

In another aspect the processor may be configured to identify one or more additional sources of content based upon a similarity to one of the plurality of sources of content. For example where a content source is an automotive manufacturer the processor may perform a search for other automotive manufactures related parts suppliers mechanics and so forth. The processor may also or instead be configured to identify one or more additional sources of content based upon a social graph of the user. This may for example include analyzing a social graph of relationships from the user to identify groups with common interests shared professions a shared history of schools or places of employment or a common current or previous residence location any of which may be used to locate other sources of content that may be of interest to the user.

The display may include any suitable components for displaying visual data in two or three dimensions including without limitation commonly available display technologies such as a cathode ray tube a light emitting diode LED display a liquid crystal display LCD or any other display using any other display technology as well as combinations of the foregoing. In one aspect the display may be a surface that receives a projection in which case the surface may include any coating necessary or desired to obtain a suitably visible display area within or adjacent to the working volume . It will also be appreciated that the display may be hardware integrated into a three dimensional printer or the display may be a modular display or a computing device with a display such as a tablet or other mobile computing device that is positioned as illustrated in the figure and coupled in a communicating relationship with a remote processor to display desired visual information on a screen thereof. In general the display may be a touch screen or the like that provides a user interface permitting direct touch based user interactions. All such combinations that can yield a controllable display surface in the desired position and orientation relative to the working volume may serve as the display contemplated herein.

In one aspect the display may be vertically oriented as described above. The display may also be positioned on a back panel of an enclosure where for example a front of the enclosure is on the right side of the working volume depicted in and the back panel of the enclosure is on the left side of the working volume as depicted in . The display may instead be positioned away from and parallel with a back panel and immediately adjacent to the working volume or in any other suitable position. AS noted above the enclosure may be omitted in its entirety or may not have a back panel in which case the display may be positioned in any suitable location facing the working volume and visible from a front of the printer.

In general a processor such as a processor controller or other control circuitry of the three dimensional printer may be coupled in a communicating relationship with the display and configured to display information on the display related to operation of the three dimensional printer.

The display may generally display information related to a three dimensional printer an object being fabricated and or a user of the three dimensional printer and so forth. This may include text graphics animations images video web content simulations renderings of three dimensional models and so forth. Various types of information that might be usefully presented in the display are discussed later in this document by way of non limiting examples.

In addition to an interior display facing the working volume as described above the printer may include a display on an exterior of the enclosure and facing away from the working volume to provide a conventional control panel for the printer.

In one aspect the enclosure may include a front panel with an opening for visual and physical access to the working volume. A display may be positioned within the enclosure e.g. adjacent to a rear panel of the enclosure and oriented so that a display surface of the display is visible through the opening in the front panel . That is the display may be on a back side of the working volume and or the enclosure as viewed from the front in and visible from the front through the opening in the front panel .

A display for a printer as generally described above may provide a wide range of useful information to a user of a printer such as any information relating to operation of the printer or information directed to a specific or general user of the printer.

For example the display may present information including diagnostic information for the three dimensional printer such as any information for calibration or information characterizing proper or improper functioning of the three dimensional printer or its various components. The information may also or instead include status information for the three dimensional printer. For example status information may include one or more of an x position a y position a z position or an extrusion temperature of a tool or other component movable within the working volume. The status information may include a temperature of the working volume a temperature of a build platform a temperature of an object being fabricated by the three dimensional printer or an ambient temperature outside an enclosure for the three dimensional printer or within the working volume. The status information may also or instead include any information or data relating to a build executing on the three dimensional printer such as a percentage completion a time to completion a material type an amount of build material remaining in a supply a current material cost for a current state of fabrication an expected material cost for a completed fabrication and so forth.

In another aspect the display may present registration marks for calibration. These marks may be used for example to manually calibrate x position y position and or z position of a tool for the three dimensional printer. In another aspect where the three dimensional printer includes a camera or the like registration marks may be displayed and captured by the camera for use in an automated calibration procedure. In another aspect the registration marks may be used for calibration of the camera such as to determine a position and orientation of the camera relative to a working volume. Thus for example a horizontal build platform may display a variety of machine recognizable features which may be imaged by the camera and used to determine a position of the build platform relative to the camera or a position of a camera relative to the build platform. Similarly the registration marks may be used for calibration of a three dimensional scanner machine vision system or other device coupled to the three dimensional printer.

The registration marks may also or instead be used for a variety of two dimensional or three dimensional processing tasks. For example the registration marks may be used as a reference for measuring objects within a field of view. to detect edges of an object to locate occlusions of a camera or scanner view to mechanically center or position a movable camera to identify an expected starting or stopping point for an extrusion process or for any other process that might be augmented with a display of marks patterns or the like on a plane adjacent to or within a build volume.

In another aspect the display may provide a rendering of an object being fabricated by the three dimensional printer. For example this may include a two dimensional rendering of a digital model of the object a silhouette of the object an outline of the object or any other rendering that permits visual comparison of the physical object to a digital model therefore.

Other information may also or instead be usefully provided in visual form on the display. For example the information may include a representation of temperature for one or more regions of the build platform. Thus where the build platform is instrumented to detect local temperatures or where an infrared camera or other spatial heat detection system can provide data a thermal map of the build platform may be created and corresponding colors may be displayed such as on a vertical display on or behind the build platform or projected directly on to the build platform using any suitable projector s .

In another aspect the information may include media synchronized to a fabrication of an object by the three dimensional printer. This may without limitation include any suitable synchronized video or the like as well as accompanying media such as music or narration providing information about the object including uses for the object a history of the object information about an author of the object and so forth. The information may also or instead include computer generated images. For example this may include visualizations such as a simulation of a tool path in two dimensions i.e. for a current layer or three dimensions which may be synchronized to a current print. In another aspect this may include fanciful visualizations triggered e.g. by sounds from printer motors or other hardware or controlled by x y z positioning control signals or the like.

In another aspect the display may present an advertisement. The advertisement may be selected for example based upon an object that is being currently fabricated by the three dimensional printer and may relate for example to other related objects that can be fabricated an author or publisher of a digital model for the object and the author s related works and so forth. In another aspect the advertisement may be selected based upon a history of printing activity for the three dimensional printer or based upon a history of printing activity for a user of the three dimensional printer. The advertisement may also or instead be selected based upon one or more capabilities of the three dimensional printer. The advertisement may be for various consumables such as build material suited to the printer. The advertisement may also or instead be targeted based upon the manufacturer or model of the printer printer capabilities a user profile and so forth.

Other information may also or instead be presented such as a user notification of a three dimensional model that is available for download. For example where a content publisher provides syndicated publication or the like a user may subscribe to a source from the publisher. When a new item of content is published meeting one or more user selected criteria a corresponding notice may be displayed on the display for viewing at the printer. As another example a user history of printing activity may be monitored and a notification may be sent to the printer for display when a new item of potential interest is identified either by a search from the printer or by a remote print server or other web based print management tool. Similarly a user may define one or more filters or criteria of interest and responsive items may be displayed on the display when they become available.

The information may relate to software for the three dimensional printer. For example this may include a firmware update available for the three dimensional printer a software update available for a device associated with the three dimensional printer or a website containing information related to the three dimensional printer. The website may e.g. contain software for three dimensional printing three dimensional modeling and so forth which may be software specifically created for the three dimensional printer or software generally applicable to three dimensional printing modeling or other tasks associated with a user of the three dimensional printer. The website may also or instead contain other relevant information such as sources of material for purchase models for fabrication and so forth.

The information may include images captured by a camera and related to a current print job. For example this may include current images from a camera or other imaging device coupled to the printer. This may for example include a top view of an object or a birds eye view from a tool head of the printer. This may also or instead include a thermal image of an object being fabricated or related hardware such as a build platform tool head or the like. In another aspect the image s may include animations or slide shows of previously completed prints of an object either by the printer that is displaying the images or by other users and or remote printers.

The information may include a user interface for operating the printer. This may for example include various menus and so forth which may be accessed e.g. from a keypad or buttons on the printer or with a mouse or the like coupled to the printer or to a computer or other device that is locally connected to the printer. This may include menus for printer configuration printer utilities calibration load or unload build material etc. print selection print queue management and so forth.

The information may also be related to current usage of a printer in a variety of ways. For example where a printer is inactive for a predetermined period of time or where a printer is active with a print job and not available for other interaction a screen saver may be presented. Similarly

In one aspect the information may include social network information. This may for example include printable objects of potential interest to a user based upon e.g. the user s social graph and an object that is currently being printed. This may also include social information related to an object that is selected for printing or currently being printed. For example the display may show likes shares followers or any other indications of interest in an object or an author of an object by other users. Similarly this may include ratings rankings or other individual or aggregated user feedback as well as individual comments and the like available through a social network or other online resource relating to three dimensional fabrication. Similarly the information may include feedback specific to the user. For example the feedback may include badges trophies or other similar awards or notifications related to a user s printing activity. More specific acknowledgements may be provided such as Congrats This is your 100print Similarly information such as recommended print settings assembly instructions or the like that is available for an object may be retrieved from a social media site and displayed on the display. The display may more specifically show a web page or other web content from a social media site that hosts the object being fabricated. Such a web page may include the various types of information described herein and may be tailored to particular user where the user is a registered user of the social media site.

In one aspect a social network for printing may aggregate printability statistics based upon detection of completed builds and rank models e.g. as easy medium and hard or using any other categories rankings or score to indicate printability which information may be presented on the display during a print or before the print is initiated. Additional flow control may be added. For example the display may show text such as This model is nearly impossible to print based upon user feedback. Are you sure you want to proceed Similarly the social network may aggregate useful metadata which may also be helpful. For example the display may show text such as This object is most successful when using medium quality print settings or This object is most successful when using 0.1 mm layer height. Would you like to change the default settings for this print More generally any useful information that can be obtained from user created rankings commentary or from an automated analysis or evaluation of prints of an object might be used to generate helpful text that can be displayed as information to a user on the displays described herein. In this context feedback may be specific to a particular type of machine so that relevant feedback can be more closely tailored to a user who is receiving the displayed information.

A social network may in general include a network hosted by a social website dedicated to three dimensional printing where data such as rankings statistic printability data and the like may be aggregated for various users. A social network may also or instead include any other social network that permits creation of explicit social links people that are liked people that are followed e.g. for commentary people that are known and so forth or explicit assertions of identity through which users of three dimensional printers can share or exchange information any of which may provide or extend a social graph for operators of three dimensional printers in a manner that permits inferences about social relationships professional relationships affinity groups likes and dislikes and so forth. Social network information may include any such relationships and or any information shared through such relationships.

In another aspect there is disclosed herein a method that includes aggregating printability information through a social network and displaying the printability information to a user who is viewing or has selected an object or model for fabrication on a three dimensional printer. This may include automated aggregation such as through detecting completion of builds of an object by members of the social network. The feedback may include print metadata such as printer type print settings and so forth. This may also or instead include aggregation of user created feedback rankings evaluations and the like. The information displayed may include any such social network information. For example this may include a ranking such as any of the scores evaluations ranking categories or the like described above. The information may include a printability statistic for the object which may for example be based on aggregated success rates or the like from other users in the social network. The information may include recommended print settings or other comments provided through a social network site. The information may also or instead include user specific feedback for the object such as the congratulatory messages described above.

In another aspect the display may present information including descriptive information for an object being fabricated such as a title author creator source and the like. Other descriptive information may include any narrative or text relating to the object a thumbnail or other image of the object and so forth. Where the object is a part of a multi part object the information may include a depiction of the entire multi part object e.g. with the current object highlighted or the information may include a depiction of a next object to be printed for the multi part object.

In another aspect the printer may include an integrated payment processor and the display may provide an interface for processing payments. This may be particularly useful where for example the printer is located at a retail site where users operate the printer on a time material or other pay as you go basis.

It will be appreciated that the various types of information described above may also or instead be displayed on a computer or other resource locally coupled to the printer. Thus various user interfaces and features are further contemplated independent of the positioning of a display that is used to present the information. All such variations are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.
