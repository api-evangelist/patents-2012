The present non provisional patent application patent claims the benefit of priority of co pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 550 900 filed on Oct. 24 2011 and entitled LINKING COMPANY AND RECEIPT DATA WITH PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS the contents of which are incorporated in full by reference herein.

Generally the field of art of the present disclosure pertains to payment systems and methods and more particularly to an enhanced customer interaction channel where the identity of the customer may or may not be known before a payment transaction begins and without prior acceptance opt in or participation of the customer with a merchant or seller desiring to utilize the channel.

There exists a great deal of knowledge experience data and operational experience in the prior art surrounding the field generally known as electronic payment transaction processing and the corresponding systems and methods that operate the various electronic payment networks. Exemplary payment transactions systems include well known brands such as Visa MasterCard Discover American Express a.k.a Amex and other networks such as the Automated Clearinghouse ACH system operated by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association NACHA paper check and check image processing system coupon redemption systems customer loyalty or reward aka points systems and the like. Traditionally these systems are intended to efficiently and securely facilitate the transfer of monetary value from a buyer to a seller who provided a product good or service to the buyer for the agreed upon value amount. Typically the buyer and seller or customer business or other entity relationship have utilized a variety of electronic transaction processing methods electronic messages electronic data formats machine formats and the like to accomplish the value or payment transfer and then typically they utilize a second separate system to deliver the physical or digital item good or service to the buyer. Thus these electronic payment transaction processing systems do not facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the customer to the buyer and instead focus on monetary accuracy speed reliability and being a guaranteed source of known good funds.

However to facilitate future sales or to enhance existing or future transactions between a buyer and the seller it would be advantageous for the seller to know how to reach customers via a known good transaction information channel which exists outside of the payment or value transfer systems. Historically sellers reached out or communicated to prospective customers via advertising and marketing systems and methods which are separate from and distinct from the payment processing channels or systems. Thus to drive sales and increase business a seller or company must know how to reach their existing customers or utilize broad reach mass market advertising and sales methods with unsure or unproven results in terms of effectiveness in reaching the desired or targeted customer. This fact may be mitigated when companies or sellers utilize channels which are based on personally identifiable data provided by their existing or previous customers during a prior transaction. Systems which are based on voluntary personal or identifiable customer data or knowledge that was gathered provided or agreed to by a customer during or after previous transactions are generally considered or known as rewards programs or loyalty programs. These reward programs are seen as valuable by customers who wish to make repeat purchases from the same seller or company and historically companies utilize these systems to track existing customer behavior patterns preferences and general statistical knowledge about their customers for use in planning future sales marketing or various other business methods goals or objectives. Even with these existing loyalty or reward type systems and methods sellers or companies who wish to reach their previous customers must depend on personally identifiable data which has provided by the customer under a voluntary or opt in process. Typically this information is provided by their customer during previous sales transactions which may or not be provided to the company or seller during the payment transaction processing method used at the time of their prior purchase. Disadvantageously loyalty or reward type systems and methods require voluntary participation from previous customers and are not able to target new customers and those customers who opt out. 

Based on the foregoing it would be advantageous to have a new type of engagement channel which could enhance the type level and amount of communication and data exchange between customers buyers and sellers companies. Such a new type of channel would overcome the unsure or unproven results associated with broad reach mass market advertising and sales methods and the limited audience reach associated with loyalty or reward type systems and methods. Designing and developing a new engagement channel or system requires overcoming the errors limitations or weaknesses of prior art systems or methods which may have attempted similar results but failed to achieve them given their inability to deal with the unpredictable and widely varying set of data elements that may be produced by the various transaction processing systems as well as the location of these systems within the payment transaction processing marketplace or the scope or reach of these systems not being universal such as the present invention.

There are existing business methods patents or applications that are known to those in the industry which attempt to do similar sounding but different aspects of processing matching inspecting sorting organizing data and the like from customer and company transaction or payment data. Some of the more notable of these prior art inventions will be described herein in order to clearly differentiate the current invention from their similar sounding names concepts or ideas. None of these existing or known systems or methods should be inferred to teach suggest or make obvious any of the current inventions novel or key aspects ideas and inventive steps or elements.

US Patent Publication Number 2011 0022628 Matching Merchant Names from Transaction Data application Ser. No. 12 900 261 by Kramer. The Kramer reference describes a computer system process to determine a matched merchant name from transaction data. This method requires and depends on a previously processed merchant name from a retrieved merchant name in order to match the processed merchant name to one of a collection of standard merchant names . Further it declares that at least one character of the retrieved merchant name may be altered to obtain the processed merchant name for example characters may be deleted or ignored to make a match. Some of the key deficiencies of the Kramer reference include 

Additionally another conventional solution includes U.S. Pat. No. 7 908 170 by Asmar titled System and Method for Facilitating Commercial Transactions which provides a system that provides vital marketing information to participating merchants and purchasing records to customers while offering the most efficient and effective system to deliver the best terms and conditions for the products and services requested by customers . Note that this system does not contemplate matching Merchant Names or IDs to transaction data nor does it provide the other embodiments or features as it depends on real time approval of a transaction at checkout. Another element of the prior art is US2012 0084135 application Ser. No. 12 896 442 by Nissan titled System and Method for Tracking Transaction Records in a Network which provides a system for processing a transaction record of a transaction between a merchant and a user . This system updates Customer records based on specified and well defined terminals which enable the processing of transaction sales data by Merchants who participate in the network provided by this invention. Note that this method again requires real time participation in the checkout transaction by specified hardware or terminals that connect to a proprietary network. This method cannot work with data generated outside of the network nor can it work with data after the fact as may be enabled by a Customer statement provider. Finally there is US2008 0103912 application Ser. No. 11 924 323 by Naccache which describes a Method of Providing Transaction Data Terminal Transaction Method Method of Enhancing Bank Statements Server Signals and Computer Program Products Corresponding Thereto which as the name implies requires a specialized terminal or device to generate enhanced data for statements such as pictures or images. The method provides for each transaction a statement line containing at least one reference for a specified transaction with the image being provided of the merchant store exterior location and or item purchased. This system cannot work with Transaction data generated by outside systems and methods nor can it provide the other benefits.

As it can be seen by those of ordinary skill in the art these existing systems methods and well known prior art do not utilize the unique method to identify Customers based on known Company identifiers based on transaction data. Additionally these existing systems cannot provide the same level of interaction with customers whether they are known or unknown and they cannot create the interactive and real time Customer interaction or engagement channel.

In an exemplary embodiment a computer implemented method includes determining a payment key associated with a specific company location and device wherein the payment key includes one or more attributes of Payment Data Company Payment Data or Merchant Data either in a native form or in a derivative form that is configured to uniquely identify the specific company location and device determining transaction data matches the payment key thereby indicating a customer had a transaction with the specific company at the location creating an engagement channel between the customer and the specific company based on the matching of the transaction data and the payment key and providing unique or enhanced data to the customer by the specific company through the engagement channel wherein the data includes one of data related to a transaction associated with the transaction data and or data related to a future transaction

In another exemplary embodiment a server includes a network interface communicatively coupled to at least one customer and at least one company a processor communicatively coupled to the network interface and memory storing instructions that when executed cause the processor to register a specific company and location derive a payment key associated with the specific company and location wherein the payment key includes one or more attributes of Payment Data Company Payment Data or Merchant Data either in a native form or in a derivative form that is configured to uniquely identify the specific company and the location receive an indication from a customer that transaction data matches the payment key thereby indicating the customer had a transaction with the specific company at the location create an engagement channel between the customer and the specific company based on the matching of the transaction data and the payment key provide data to the customer by the specific company through the engagement channel wherein the data includes one of data related to a transaction associated with the transaction data and or data related to a future transaction.

In yet another exemplary embodiment a computer includes a network interface communicatively coupled to a server on a network a processor communicatively coupled to the network interface and memory storing instructions that when executed cause the processor to execute an application or browser add in display transaction data associated with a transaction between a customer and a specific company and location match the transaction data to a predetermined payment key wherein the predetermined payment key includes one or more attributes of Payment Data Company Payment Data or Merchant Data either in a native form or in a derivative form that is configured to uniquely identify the specific company and the location display an engagement channel between the specific company and the customer and provide data to the customer from the specific company through the engagement channel wherein the data includes one of data related to a transaction associated with the transaction data and or data related to a future transaction.

In various exemplary embodiments an enhanced customer interaction channel is described where the identity of the Customer may or may not be known before the Transaction begins and without prior acceptance opt in or participation of the Customer with a Company or seller desiring to utilize the channel. The systems and methods describe the ability to match Customer transactions to Companies or merchants utilizing the system to continue and enhance their interaction with their existing Customers as well as prospective or unknown Customers. Various embodiments describe how this new customer seller interaction channel or engagement channel may be utilized and extended by Companies to enhance their interactions with Customers beyond the transaction value used to create the original match or transaction entity.

Thus the creation of a new type of channel which could enhance the type level and amount of communication and data exchange between Customers buyers and Companies sellers would be desirable in the broadest economic sense to enhance all transactions and sales efforts both past present and future Customer interactions sales support education and the similar efforts. This new type of customer engagement channel is novel and unique in particular because this channel can be used by Companies sellers to reach Customers buyers whether they are existing prior customer or new unknown Customers and without requiring prior presentment of personally identifiable data by the Customer buyer to the system operating the new channel or to the Company seller. Further it would be more desirable that this new information data communication and value transfer or exchange system could be generated automatically using prior payment or transaction history or data to match with known or identifiable data sources and without requiring any effort by the Customer buyer and not requiring pre approved opt in or consent before interaction occurs. Therefore the creation of this new channel could be enhanced if it were created by a matching system that could look at watch monitor or inspect Customer transactions without personally identifiable data being provided to Companies sellers who are members or subscribers of this new system. This new customer seller value channel would provide a new way to reach Customers via both broad based anonymous non opt in e.g. anonymous methods as well as being utilizable for direct or one to one highly targeted channels to well known identified preselected Customers and or to customers who opt in to the new channel to receive optional or additional value based on their existing and future buying or selling activities and transactions. Finally the new customer engagement channel developed by this invention can be used to enhance communication between Companies and Customers for existing items goods or services both for previously purchased items such as warranties product manuals or help product support in addition to delivering new information or offers regarding future or possible sales transactions.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a description of the high level and well known identifiable five parties of an electronic payment processing network may be labeled as follows a first party in these systems is the holder of a payment form or branded network payment account holder i.e. a customer buyer or payor the second party is the payment acceptor or merchant i.e. a merchant seller company or payee the third party is an acquiring bank or the bank which accepts and facilitates the clearing of payments on behalf of or for the benefit of the merchant the payee the fourth party is an issuing bank i.e. the bank that issued the card or payment form to the payor who may or may not extend credit to them who may provide customer support billing and collection of the actual payment flow from the payment account holder or customer or payor to the other parties and finally the fifth party is an actual brand or payment network system operator e.g. Visa V MasterCard MC Discover D American Express Amex and the like which connects all of the parties together under a well known brand identity with defined operating pricing processing and settlement rules. Note that the American Express card network operates a modified version of the five party network for card payments i.e. it is a three party model including payor merchant and Amex in that Amex traditionally has performed the roles of both the issuing bank and the acquiring bank as well as the network operator who sets the payment issuing and acceptance rules the network rules of all card payment forms are herein included in full by reference . Additionally ATM network or PIN debit card network operators function in a similar manner facilitating origination routing and settlement of payment requests between customer merchant bank or ATM operator and other payment networks or alternative payment processors originators or recipients and the like.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment an Automated Clearing House ACH network follows a related business and processing model for its electronic payment services using a four 4 party model the payor the payee an Originating bank or Originating Depository Financial Institution ODFI who is the processor and or sponsoring bank of the payee and a Receiving bank or Receiving Depository Financial Institution RDFI who debits the payor s bank account to initiate the payment transfer back to the ODFI who processes it on behalf of the payee. In the case of ACH payments the National ACH Association NACHA provides the processing and settlement rules herein included in full by reference in a similar manner to the Visa MasterCard or American Express network model. Various network operators with the Federal Reserve being the largest provide connectivity to clear or exchange NAHCA files between ODFI and RDFI. The most common payment usage of the ACH method is for Online Bill Payments OLBP or Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment EBPP ecommerce and or person to person payment PayPal and the like and all of these payment forms may be seen to function at a high level using a similar business method pricing and sales as well as risk management models to the card payment methods. Additionally the Federal Reserve and private third party networks facilitate the check payment settlement network including the image settlement rules set by ECCHO herein included by reference in full in a role similar to ACH networks and or card or electronic payment network systems.

Thus at an overall or high level the payments marketplace can be seen to be a collection of cooperating parties working together to provide customers payors and payees with a comprehensive set of payment processing services that operate under a consistent set of business rules pricing or fee structures and common standards or rules such as risk management or security requirements electronic file formats electronic messages or records and the like to facilitate payment transactions while minimizing risk of fraud and maximizing customer and merchant acceptance of their payment form in the marketplace. One example of a cooperating set of operating rules is the compliance rules of the Payments Card Industry PCI Data Security Standards herein included in full by reference including the newest forms or modifications or custom system rules. Another example is the Industry Standards Organization ISO electronic messaging standards for financial transaction card originated messages Interchange message specifications such as the ISO 8583 format and the like. Note that business models rules pricing and often compliance security and risk management specifications may vary by payment form or provider or operating party within a network system but often these elements may be dictated by the branded payment network operator as a requirement on all or some of the participating parties.

Beyond the five well known parties that are commonly identified in the card payment networks there are additional parties that help connect or operate components of a payment or transaction processing network to facilitate key aspects of the processing lifecycle. These additional parties provide critical or value added services for or on behalf of one of the existing five parties. Some examples of these additional parties or vendors are Point of Sale POS equipment providers who facilitate magnetic stripe card swipe transactions including the swipe box terminal providers such as VeriFone Hypercom Ingenico and the like. Other examples include electronic network connection switch services which acquire payment messages and process and or route them to appropriate processing operators which link POS transaction swipes to the acquiring and issuing banks examples of these are vendors such as First Data TSYS Global Payments and the like. Additionally non POS environments such as ATM or PIN debit networks Internet websites ecommerce transactions and the like may flow through ATM machines PIN debit keypad devices ecommerce shopping carts and or payment gateways aggregators or network providers such as NYCE Star CyberSource PayPal Square Google Checkout Authorize.NET and the like who facilitate payment transactions by routing the transaction details to switches and or other vendors or processors in order to reach banks and or payment networks. Businesses or merchants may also purchase or utilize other business transaction processing services such as invoice or lockbox services loyalty or rewards points tracking and processing or rebate or coupon redemption processing services all of which may flow through similar acquiring and processing networks or new alternative payment processing services and the like. Finally new mobile transactions may be made by customers payors or received by merchants payees using cell phones or smart phones or tablet devices or PDAs such as the Apple iPad or other digital assistants and the like which may use one of a variety of near field communication NFC methods barcode scanning human biometric methods as well as the more traditional card swipe models to initiate a payment transaction. These transactions allow the merchant payee to charge the customer payor for goods and or services and facilitate their purchase s by one of a variety of card or account numbers tokens one time use numbers pseudo IDs GUIDs stored value identifiers e wallets and the like which may perform a similar if not identical function to the traditional plastic card payment swipe transactions.

Finally there are various sales service and support parties widely known as Independent Sales Service Organizations or ISOs which facilitate the recruitment of and selling to merchants to accept or acquire many of these payment forms along with the delivery training management and operational effectiveness of a payment form or method and any required equipment within a targeted market. ISOs that sell a specific payment form to payment receivers payees usually explain the pricing delivery and operation of these payment services to their customers across the various retail stores merchants or in general any business desiring to have payment processing services. Thus given the interconnectedness complexity and possible combination of parties operating to originate clear and settle a payment transaction it can be seen by those skilled in the art that the understanding of and at times assignment of risk or ultimate responsibility for a transaction across these various entities may be confusing or at times even hidden from the participants and may unfortunately be a variable or subjective matter to some of the parties or unknown to any or each party before a transaction occurs. Additionally it is well known to those in the art that these systems may provide various levels of data information details or knowledge about a specific transaction set of transactions or type of transactions to the merchant company or seller based on the type and level of service purchased by or subscribed to by the merchant or company from the electronic payment transaction system. Thus these existing systems may provide various levels of costs security reliability information and delivery or support and the like to companies who utilize them to facilitate the selling of goods and services to their customers.

Prior attempts to utilize the data results or values from transactions between buyers and sellers to identify track or enhance interactions with Customers are well known to those with experience in these arts. The failure of these prior or existing well known systems to provide automated autonomous and anonymous matching of merchants companies to buyers customers has created the need for the systems and methods described herein. That is in an exemplary embodiment the systems and methods provide an accurate technique to match transactions between buyer and sellers without relying on the actual merchant or seller name. Additionally the current invention avoids the failures of previous systems which failed due to the various and wide ranging inconsistencies in merchant payment and transaction data streams which prevent matching on merchant names standardizing merchant names or standardizing key data elements such as Merchant ID and the like. The current embodiment overcomes the weaknesses in the transaction data stream caused by human error data input error inconsistent application of names or identities in merchant processing and many other errors of the like. Thus the current invention provides confidence to match merchant names and or IDs across key data elements.

1. The invention creates an engagement channel that is agnostic to the source of the Payment Data payment type payment system and processes or Devices used to process payments making it truly universal by overlaying all previous systems.

2. The invention sits in the middle of the various players as a hub versus trying to connect the various entities directly while it also enables a network effect by leveraging the data customers connections and value of all of these players while creating new connections.

3. The invention creates a channel that supports two types of engagements. The first type of engagement allows Companies to publish content to their Customer or an anonymous Customer via connections using various types of Payment Data without a Customer having to register with the System and without the Company needing any PII. The second type of engagement allows Companies to publish content in a variety of ways including through a dedicated portal or social media site such as Facebook and the like if the Customer elects to register with the System.

4. The invention allows Customers to automatically receive all artifacts of a Transaction for both payments and the exchange of value by simply engaging in a Transaction.

5. The invention utilizes a Payment Key established prior to attempting to identify Companies from Payment Data versus using logic and algorithms to make the match based solely on the Payment Data itself. Such logic typically utilizes an external data source such as a list of standardized merchant names for matching whereas the invention does care what fields are used and what the merchant name is because it is using a key derived from static data that could be anything. In the example above the invention could identify and distinguish Joe s Pizza from Pizza by Joe.

6. The invention utilizes more than one field of data for matching versus relying on just the merchant name field. Based on current convention the invention would also use merchant city but again the invention is designed to use all available static field data.

7. The invention is not only able to match a Company but also a Location and Device s at Locations including scenarios where Companies have similar names identical names or units of a chain or franchise operating under identical business names at Locations.

8. The invention is able to merge Payment Data and Transaction Data which are available through disparate systems into one engagement channel. As a result the invention allows for a holistic understanding of a Transaction including both the exchange of value and the exchange of payment.

9. The invention has a specific process for identifying and handling duplicates. Much like a domain name the first merchant to register is assigned the payment key made up of the static data fields. If another merchant wants to register and happens to have the same field values the system will not allow the registration but will instead provide an alternative value for the static fields which it will hold so the merchant can have it changed with its acquirer. This avoids any errors related to duplicates.

10. The invention identifies the payment key in advance using two unique methods. One is to provide a merchant with a payment card to run both with and without a unique card number and the other is to get the data from the merchant account record at their processor or acquirer. These are the only two methods that provide the merchant field and other field values in advance.

11. The invention supports harvesting Payment Data used for matching from both client side software such as a browser extension or via server side software that runs the harvesting without the need of client software which for example can be done by executing server side application upon a page load containing Payment Data whereby the server side code extracts the Payment Data and transmits it to the System without requiring and installation by the Customer. Also the location of the server side process may vary.

12. The invention supplements the data within the engagement channel to add more value beyond the traditional payment data.

13. The invention is able to link any string of characters to identify Products within Transaction Data versus relying on standard product numbers such as GTINs.

14. Based on matching Products from transaction Data the invention can automatically distribute Product Data such as user manuals warranties additional services coupons upgrades and other material and the like.

Before describing the systems and methods it is desirable to define the following terms for use in describing and defining the systems and methods throughout this document. Whenever used in this document whether in capitalized or uncapitalzed form singular or plural form the following words or terms should be generally interpreted to conform to the following ideas concepts or intentions as defined as follows 

a. Category One or more categories e.g. restaurant grocery store etc. that could be used for grouping transactions reporting and or tax purposes.

b. Contact Information One or more addresses which could include latitude and longitude mapping information postal service codes and or geolocation information phone numbers fax numbers email addresses uniform resource locators URLs or any other contact or reference information.

e. Link One or more URLs to other web sites or other web based locations which may include FTP sites blogs portals personal devices tablets PDAs and the like.

f. Message One or more messages consisting of any type of characters and of any length which could be in plain text Hyper Text Markup Language HTML contain graphics or be in any other format.

i. Offer One or more advertisements offers promotions or other related marketing materials methods or systems.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a block diagram illustrates a real time engagement channel enabled by the systems and methods described herein. In the general course of commerce or buying and selling customers engage in transactions with companies every day where they exchange money a payment in some monetary form for some product good or service or something of value provided to them by the company . The type of value and payment used to facilitate these transactions can vary but the process is universally understood and accepted and it is understood by those in the art how these well known transaction processing systems produce sets of payment data which describe define or identify the act value exchange transaction between the buyer and seller. For example two exemplary processes are described in although any process is contemplated herein.

Typically the level of transaction detail or knowledge encompassing a transaction is at an anonymous level especially for companies operating from brick and mortar store locations where the customers walk in purchase something and walk out without the company ever knowing who they were. However regardless of the type of company there is one constant which is needed in order to engage customers in future transactions which is that the company must obtain some type of personal information or PII typically an address of some type such as an email address fax number phone number and the like to reach out and communicate with the customer . In order to have such a personal contact point the customer must take action to opt in or volunteer to set it up or provide this data and then they must actually follow through and provide this data to the company . So in order to allow the company to engage the customer two things must happen the customer must establish a personal address or point of contact or other PII data and the company must obtain one or more of the customers personal addresses. Typically this type of information and communication is provided under some type or form of customer loyalty or rewards system where the customer is incented to provide such information in the hope that they will accumulate some level of value for participating in the system. Such a system of communication has worked well but has many limitations and requires active participation by the parties the customer and the company . Further statistics show that the customers are not eager to provide personal addresses or PII to the company and in fact many states are passing laws that restrict companies from even asking for them. So what was a difficult process of establishing a relationship between the company and the customer is only getting harder.

There are other engagement options such as television and radio or other well known marketing and sales methods which do not require the two steps listed above but in those cases the company is not specifically engaging the customer but widely sending out a broadcast message or offer for anyone with a TV or radio phone mailbox or email box and the like to see or hear. So while such forms of engagement do eliminate the two requirements above the content is not able to be addressed to a specific audience or targeted audience by a company which makes sense because there is no personal address available to do so.

The systems and methods described herein not only eliminate the two requirements described above but also allow the company to provide content to only their customers for example such as to those who have previously purchased certain goods and services from them as well as provide content to new unknown or anonymous customers. The systems and methods create a brand new channel i.e. the real time engagement channel directly between the company and the customer without any of the limitations and or requirements currently in place today. Specifically the systems and methods do this by applying processes and technology to the existing and well establish system of electronic payment processing. Unlike cash or other similar instruments electronic payments such as credit or debit card payments and the like have data artifacts and this data typically flows through various networks and systems i.e. payment data. The payment data associated with electronic payments has both static and dynamic data elements. For instance a dynamic data element may be the Payment Amount because that changes for each transaction whereas Merchant Name and Merchant City may be static data that is associated with every Payment. The systems and methods are able to use the static data to identify the company such that when the customer views the Payment Data on a Statement the company can then distribute information to and or engage with the customer . So the systems and methods leverage the transaction data to create the new channel on top of the existing payment process.

As shown in one of the key aspects of the systems and methods is that it does not require any changes in the systems used to process payments or the processing itself. It lays on top of the existing infrastructure making it universally available to all Companies and Customers . At a high level once the Customer makes a Payment to the Company that Customer can view basically any type of information offered or published from the Company and Third Parties such as manufacturers and the like when viewing their Statement.

Even if the payment system included more data in the Payment Data the data is still static and at one point in time. For instance if Payment Data included the street address of the Company which is actually a possibility that is still static information versus having a channel that allows the Company to publish content in real time and on a dynamic and changing basis. Again the systems and methods establish the channel and do not seek to simply add more information to the current Payment Data. That is the channel uses whatever Payment Data is included in the current payment process without changes thereto.

While the systems and methods utilize the current payment process there are two key differences. First the channel can be used to display any dynamic content related to Payment Data whereas the payment process can only display static information. Second the channel can be used to link the Company and the Customer such that after a single purchase the Company can continue to engage the Customer without Payment Data such as through a portal or PFM whereas the payment process does not link Companies and Customers other than to exchange payment for value.

As described above the systems and methods seek to establish the new channel between the Company and the Customer that does not require the Customer to establish a personal address or the Company to obtain said personal address. Further the systems and methods seek allow the channel to be used by the Company to deliver content only to their Customers versus a broadcast that could be received by anyone. Once the channel is established there are a variety of forms of engagement that can take place not only between the Company and its Customers but can also include Third Parties.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment an exemplary transaction and an exemplary screen shot of using the channel with the transaction are illustrated. The transaction includes data the customer may see when viewing a statement such as online or the like. Note the transaction is shown for illustration purposes and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the transaction could take various different forms with different static and dynamic data included therein.

In various exemplary embodiments the systems and methods provided layer the channel on the transaction . This can take various forms as will be described herein such as software included on the customer s computer or device viewing the transaction that keys in on the data associated therewith to bring up details such as the exemplary screen shot . The exemplary screen shot shows an exemplary client side graphical user interface GUI based on the transaction . Generally the channel is based on connecting the customer and the company through the Payment Data included in the transaction with the exemplary screen shot being one exemplary interaction over the channel .

For example the customer can view the transaction in whatever format it is available in such as without limitation a secure website e.g. visa.com bankofamerica.com wellsfargo.com etc. a financial website or PFM e.g. mint.com accounting software e.g. Quicken Quickbooks etc. and the like. The customer can have software installed that parses the transaction and enables the customer to bring up the screen shot which can be located in another server hosting the channel . Through the channel the company can interact with the customer based on the transaction . If the channel is used to link the Company and the Customer the same dynamic information shown above could be displayed basically anywhere.

When Payment Processing is performed the resulting Payment Data or transaction data has both static and dynamic data elements that can vary by Location and Device. Dynamic data elements could be the Payment Amount while the static elements could be Merchant Name and Merchant City. In various exemplary embodiments the systems and methods include a system to operate the channel using the payment data. In order to identify a Company Location and or Device from Payment Data the static data elements of Payment Data must be associated to a specific Company Location and Device. As an example if the only static elements of the Payment Data are Merchant Name and Merchant City then the value of Merchant Name and Merchant City together form a unique identifier herein referred to as a Payment key . When the Payment Key is associated in System with a specific Company Location and Device the System can identify that same Company Location and Device within Payment Data provided by a variety of sources in the future. Once that capability is established Company and Third Parties can publish Content or Offers to Customers by either attaching the Content which is established in Data Exchange and Data Processing see below to the Payment Data or displaying it elsewhere such as in System directly or in Third Party Systems.

For example conventionally systems use the merchant name solely to identify the merchant from the transaction . However the Merchant Name used for Payment Processing does not need to match the actual business name. Unlike systems such as used for domain names because Merchant Name is not used as the identifier for Payment Processing i.e. Merchant Number and Payment Number are typically used to fulfill payments and Merchant Name is typically used just to provide the Customer information regarding the Transaction there is no requirement for Merchant Names that flow through Payment Processing to be unique and as such there may be duplicate Merchant Names. Using Merchant Names to match Companies with Payment Data and transaction data is limited in its capacity e.g. if Joe s Pizza s Merchant Name used for Transactions is Pizza by Joe no match is possible . Using Merchant Names to match Companies with Transactions is prone to errors and matching the wrong merchant to the wrong transaction e.g. if there are two Joe s Pizzas the matching may match the wrong transaction with the wrong Joe s Pizza given the lack of clarity between merchant name and which location and device generated the transaction. If the message format for Payment Processing ever changes whereby a Merchant Name is not used for some reason e.g. Merchant Name is replaced with an ID number using Merchant Names to match Companies with Payment Data would not work at all.

The systems and methods identify the value of all useable i.e. the minimum data fields that are universally or mostly presented on Statements realizing more fields of data are available and may be used in the future static fields which can include the Merchant Name field that is passed as part of Payment Processing in advance of Transactions so it is not reliant on the Merchant Name matching or having a similar value as the Companies business names to match Companies to Transactions. In fact the systems and methods do not care which fields are used and what the Merchant Name is because it is using a key derived from static data that could be anything. In the example above the systems and methods could identify Joe s Pizza from Pizza by Joe because it is not reliant on the Merchant Name being similar or the same as the Company s business name which in this case is Joe s Pizza. The systems and methods utilize more than one field of data for matching versus relying on just the Merchant Name field. In some cases Merchant name could be the only static data that can be used for matching but that is not typically the case. And even if it was the systems and methods can identify a Company with a Merchant Name value even if it is not even close to the Company s business name because the systems and methods identify the value of Merchant Name whatever it is prior to performing a matching. In an exemplary embodiment the systems and methods would also use Merchant City but again the systems and methods are designed to use all available static field data which includes both Merchant ID and Payment Number even though those are not traditionally displayed on Statements for privacy and security reasons. The systems and methods have a specific process for identifying and handling duplicate Payment Keys. Again because typically Merchant ID and Payment Number both of which are required to be unique within a given payment system are used for identifying the Customer and Company related to a Payment there is no requirement that remaining static fields which are the fields primarily used to populated Statements need to be unique. In order for the systems and methods to match in such an unstructured environment duplicate detection and handling is required. Much like a domain name Payment Keys are associated with Companies on a first come first served basis meaning once a Payment Key is assigned to one Company it cannot be assigned to another except if certain situations such as the original company is no longer in business decided not to use it etc. or if the format of the Payment Key changed e.g. new static field become available thereby making the Payment Keys between the two companies unique . If another Company wants to register and happens to have the same field values i.e. the same Payment Key value the System will not allow the registration or assignment of the Payment Key but will instead provide an alternative value for the static fields which it will hold so the Company can have it changed with its Acquirer. This avoids any errors related to duplicates.

The systems and methods identify the payment key in advance using two unique methods. One is to provide a merchant with a payment typically a debit credit card that has either a unique Payment Number and or Payment Amount such that the System can identify the Company that processes the payment. As an example the System could provide a Company with a credit card 1234 1234 1234 1234 and instruct the Company to run a charge of 0.17. In this example the charge amount is unique to the Company such that when System received the Statement for the credit card it can identify the Company based on the 0.17 charge. This procedure can be done for each Device and each Location using the same principle. Further a unique credit card number could be assigned versus a unique charge amount. The other method is to get the data from the Merchant Account record on file at the merchant s Acquirer processor or the like. These are the only two methods that provide the Merchant Name field and other field values in advance which allow the system to generate the unique Payment Key.

While the systems and methods utilize known values that do not need to match a business name the Payment Key can appear in different places within the Payment Data and Statements on an Issuer by Issuer basis. Therefore in addition to its unique approach and systems for matching the Companies the systems and methods also employ logic to find the matching value within a set of data. Typically it can be done with a wild card search but can employ other methods. In addition while the systems and methods can rely on multiple data fields not just the Merchant Name field some of the static fields can be truncated by the issuer. For example if one of the static fields used in the Payment Key is Merchant City and the city value is Anywhere it is possible that one Issuer may display Anywhere on a Statement whereas another Issuer may display Anywhe . Therefore the systems and methods could employ logic to identify the probability of a match based on the number of fields matched and the number of characters within the field matched or similar systems and methods which would produce unique results.

To perform the aforementioned matching of the transaction to the customer and the company a Payment Key the static data field values derived using the two methods listed above must be known by the system and Payment Data must be received by the system to make a match.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a Company Payment method for deriving a Payment Key. The payment key is used by the system to link the transaction to the Customer Company in the channel . The method utilizes a Payment with characteristics associated with a specific Company and Location herein referred to as Company Payment to be used to not only identify the Company Location and Device related to Company Payment but also to identify the Payment Key needed to identify Company Location and Device within Payment Data provided by various sources in the future. Once the System has identified the Company Locations and Devices it can extract the Payment Key from the Payment Data and associate those unique Payment Keys with the Company Locations and Devices. There is a possibility that two Companies could have the same Payment Key. In that case System will not link the duplicate Payment Key if one exists in the System but will instead recommend a new Payment Key that the Company can set up with its Acquirer.

Company Payment Submission step the act of Payment Processing being performed for Company Payment occurs. Based on the assumptions above a Payment of 0.12 is processed by Company ABC using a Device at Location 1. Next Company Payment Analysis step the act of using Company Payment Data to identify associated Company Payment Key and or Account occurs. Based on the assumptions above when the System sees a Payment Amount of 0.12 in Company Payment Data i.e. the data associated with the Company Payment it knows the Company Payment is associated with Company ABC Location 1 and as well the System could now uniquely knows the Merchant ID for that location and or Device ID used to generate the transaction. Additional the System identifies the Payment Key from the Company Payment Data which in this example assuming the static data elements used for the Payment Key are Merchant Name and Merchant City would be ABC 1 San Diego . Typically the Payment Key would be stored as two blocks of data that related to the static fields used but that is not always the case. Further the Payment Key could be changed to one or more derivative forms using encryption or other methods. Next the Payment Key Analysis step the act of comparing a Payment Key identified during Company Payment Analysis Merchant Data Analysis and or Payment Data Analysis with Payment Keys that exist in System to identify if there is a match occurs. Based on the assumptions above the System would be looking for a match of ABC 1 San Diego . If the Payment Key identified for Company ABC Location 1 ABC 1 San Diego based on the assumptions above does not exist within System then Payment Key Linking step the act of associating Payment Key with a specific Company and or Account occurs. Based on the assumptions above the Payment Key of ABC 1 San Diego would be associated with Company ABC Location 1 such that when the System then receives Payment Data from any source in the future and it sees ABC 1 San Diego it can associate link or establish a channel knowing Payment with Company ABC Location 1 thereby allowing the Company as well as Third Parties the ability to send and receive data from the Customer without ever having any PII of the Customer. The system establishes this engagement channel by attaching said data to the Payment that was matched to Company ABC Location 1 or displaying the data elsewhere such as in the System itself. If the Payment Key identified for Company ABC Location 1 ABC 1 San Diego based on the assumptions above already exists within System Payment Key Processing step the act of forgoing Payment Key Linking when a match is found during Payment Key Analysis which could include a routing in which the System identifies a new Payment Key value that would be unique in the System hold that new Payment Key in reservation for the Company to change with their Acquirer and then wait for the Company Payment Submission to occur again occurs.

In an exemplary embodiment the method can be performed using a payment method i.e. credit card provided to the company or merchant by the system solely for creating a transaction to derive the payment key therefrom.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a Merchant Data method for deriving a Payment Key. The method does not require Payment Processing of a Company Payment but instead utilizes the data associated with a Merchant Account herein referred to as Merchant Data to identify the Payment Key for a specific Company Location and Device. The Payment Key can be identified from a single record or group of Merchant Data records. Since the Payment Key should be linked with a specific Company Location and Device this method employs a different means for identifying the Company. That is because the Payment Keys could be extracted from one or more Merchant Data records without the System knowing which Companies to LINK them to. Unlike the Company Payment Method which utilized a Company Payment with specific attributes associated with a specific Company that was used by System to identify said Company the Merchant Data Method can employ a variety of techniques to identify the Company. Some techniques may include assigning the Company a unique number that is provided to the Company s Acquirer to send along with the Merchant Data records or to use the Merchant ID that is part of Merchant Data since that is unique or use the email or phone numbers in the Merchant Data because those are also unique. There is a possibility that two Companies could have the same Payment Key. In that case System will not link the duplicate Payment Key if one exists in the System but will instead recommend a new Payment Key that the Company can set up with its Acquirer.

The Merchant Data Submission step the act of Merchant Data being received by System occurs. Next Merchant Data Analysis step the act of using Merchant Data to identify associated Company Payment Key and or Account occurs. Based on the assumptions above the Merchant ID is used to identify the Merchant Data is associated with Company ABC Location 1 and as well the system could now uniquely know the Device IDs for Devices used at that Location. Additional the System identifies the Payment Key from the Merchant Data which in this example assuming the static data elements used for the Payment Key are Merchant Name and Merchant City would be ABC 1 San Diego . Typically the Payment Key would be stored as two blocks of data that related to the static fields used but that is not always the case. Further the Payment Key could be changed to one or more derivative forms using encryption or other methods. Next Payment Key Analysis step the act of comparing a Payment Key identified during Company Payment Analysis Merchant Data Analysis and or Payment Data Analysis with Payment Keys that exist in System to identify if there is a match occurs. Based on the assumptions above the System would be looking for a match of ABC 1 San Diego . If the Payment Key identified for Company ABC Location 1 ABC 1 San Diego based on the assumptions above does not exist within System then Payment Key Linking step the act of associating Payment Key with a specific Company and or Account occurs. Based on the assumptions above the Payment Key of ABC 1 San Diego would be associated with Company ABC Location 1 such that when the System then receives Payment Data from any source in the future and it sees ABC 1 San Diego it can associate that Payment with Company ABC Location 1 thereby allowing the Company as well as Third Parties the ability to send and receive data from the Customer without ever having any PII of the Customer. The system establishes this engagement channel by attaching said data to the Payment that was matched to Company ABC Location 1 or displaying the data elsewhere such as in the System itself. If the Payment Key identified for Company ABC Location 1 ABC 1 San Diego based on the assumptions above already exists within System Payment Key Processing step the act of forgoing Payment Key Linking when a match is found during Payment Key Analysis which could include a routing in which the System identifies a new Payment Key value that would be unique in the System hold that new Payment Key in reservation for the Company to change with their Acquirer occurs.

When a Transaction is performed there are typically related artifacts such as a receipt bill of sale or an invoice and the like. Like Payment Data on Statements where the Merchant Name may not actually be the Company s business name the information related to Products presented on Transaction artifacts may not accurately reflect the related Products. For instance if a Customer buys a Samsung TV Model 123 from a Company and the receipt only lists TV as the description the Customer is unable to know from looking at the receipt that the TV purchased was a Samsung let alone the Model number. In addition to possible confusion not being able to clearly identify Product inhibits the Customer from identifying and gathering Product Data such as user manuals and warranties. Because there are no standards related to what a Transaction artifact must show use of a known value related to a specific product herein referred to a Product Key can allow Products to be identified on Transaction artifacts. Using the same example as above if the value TV was linked to Samsung TV Model 123 for a Company then by simply knowing TV the specific Product can be identified and Product data can be associated with said Product. Once that capability is established Company and Third Parties can publish Content or Offers to Customers by either attaching the Content which is established in Data Exchange and Data Processing see below to the Payment Data or displaying it elsewhere such as in System directly or in Third Party Systems.

While GTIN s exist there is no required product numbering systems for all Products that would allow a customer to identify a Product. For instance custom products i.e. those products made to order do not have a GTIN. There is no requirement for Companies to use GTINs even if they exist on receipts of other Transaction artifacts. Some POS and transaction systems cannot support enough characters for GTINs which have been recently expanded. Some POS and other transaction systems do not have enough memory to store all of the GTINs even if they can print them for all Products sold by a Company. Some Companies do not use product numbers and instead just provide descriptions. Some Companies choose to create internal SKU to GTIN links that hide the GTIN from the buyer or otherwise obscure the original manufacture s identifier or GTIN for an item. In addition there is no universal repository for product documentation such as user manuals or warranties nor is there a universal or consistent method to link product GTIN to manuals or documentations outside of the systems and methods of the original manufacturer. Using GTINs for matching is limited in its capacity because not every product has a GTIN and because of the POS limitations cited above. For example if a computer had a GTIN of 987654321 but the transaction data showed 1234 no match is possible. Because of the matching issues distribution of product related materials is limited and prone to error.

Similar to company matching the concept employed here is that the systems and methods know the value of the product number prior to seeing the transaction data thereby avoiding having to match using GTINs. Instead the present invention uses any unique value established by the Company or System which can be unique to a specific Company or unique across multiple Companies to identify a Product from Transaction Data. Unlike Payment Data Transaction Data can come from a variety of sources and is not typically included as part of Payment Data i.e. the payment systems are used for transferring payment and not information about value exchange . As such the systems and methods allow for Transaction data to be part of or separate from Payment Data. Using the example above the systems and methods could identify the product with GTIN 987654321 by seeing 1234 because it is not relying on matching against a known database but rather knowing the matching value in advance. The systems and methods allow any offer information or document to be associated with the unique string value that allows a product match. Therefore the systems and methods allow a customer to get all data associated with a product by simply making a purchase regardless of the number used for identification or system used for processing.

The ultimate outcome would allow a Company and or Third Party such as a manufacturer to provide Product Data which is established in Data Exchange and Data Processing see below to Customers without requiring any change in systems or the way the Company operates by allowing the Company to associate a Product Key with a Product and link data or information such as user manuals or warranties such that when Transaction Data is received by the System it can identify Products without having to rely on GTINs and then distribute the data and information such as product manuals and warranties to the Customer. The Product Key does not need to be a number but could in fact be the product description. As per the example above TV could be used to identify the Samsung TV Model 1234.

Note the systems and methods can support receiving transaction data in any form including email fax etc and the like. The systems and methods can use both machine readable and human readable data in that it can employ OCR technology to extract the data it needs. The system must know the Product Key and the system must know the associated product materials related to the unique number to link them.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a Product Key for deriving a Product Key. This method utilizes a Product Key to identify Products associated with Transactions thereby enabling any form of information or data to be linked to a specific Product.

Product Key Submission step the act of Product Key being received by System along with associated Product Data to be linked to said Product Key occurs. Next Product Key Analysis step the act of comparing a Product Key received during Product Key Submission with Product Keys that exist in System to identify if there is a match occurs. If the Product Key received during the Product Key Submission does not exist within the System Product Key Linking step the act of associating Product Key with a specific Product Product Data Company and or Account occurs. If the Product Key received during the Product Key Submission already exists in the System Product Key Processing step the act of forgoing Product Key Linking when a match is found during Product Key Analysis but a new Product Key value that would be unique in the System is suggested occurs.

Once Companies and Locations can be identified within Payment Data a wide variety of information can be shared between Company Third Parties and Customers without having to collect any PII such as email address from the Customers once the channel is enabled. Such information can be attached to the related Payment Transaction or it may be shared in other ways.

The System leverages the existing payment process to create the new engagement channel whereby the Companies can publish and exchange data with the Customers without ever having to collect any personal information or change the way they do business. If the Customer elects to Register or perform Registration there may be further benefits because all Companies where the Customer made Payments will be linked to the Customer regardless of whether the Customer ever makes another payment to those Companies . So the System provides an anonymous communication channel tied to Payments as well as the ability for Customers to establish permanent links with Companies .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a merchant data method that utilizes Credentials to facilitate Data Exchange. The method can apply to a wide variety of credentials connections and types.

Credential Submission occurs step the act of Credential and optionally Content being received by System occurs. Content may be received with Credential in the case where the method for Data Exchange is email in which the email address can be the Credential and the email would also include Content. Next Credential Analysis step the act of comparing a Credential received during Credential Submission to Credentials that exist in System to identify if there is a match occurs. If the Credential received during Credential Submission exists within System Data Exchange step the act of adding inputting outputting editing deleting viewing moving copying publishing synchronizing and or any other data manipulation of Content occurs as well as the use of optical character recognition OCR to extract machine readable data from human readable data to and or from System occurs. Additionally Data Linking step the act of utilizing one or more characters and or one or more groups of one or more characters of Credential and or Content to associate Content with one or more Accounts and or associate Content with other Content occurs. If the Credential received during Credential Submission does not exist within System the operation ends step typically with an error to the entity submitting the Credentials.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a payment data method . While Credentials may or may not be used to allow Payment Data Submission the key difference with this method is that it uses the Payment Key to identify Company Location and Device for Data Exchange versus relying on Credentials. For example an Issuer may have Credentials to interface with the System but it doesn t have Credentials for Companies so in order to link Payments with Companies the Issuer would supply Payment Data to System which would in turn identify the Companies Locations and Devices and then perform Data Exchange.

Payment Data Submission step the act of Payment Data being received by System occurs. Next Payment Data Analysis step the act of using Payment Data to identify associated Company Payment Key and or Account occurs. Next Payment Key Analysis step the act of comparing a Product Key received during Product Key Submission with Product Keys that exist in System to identify if there is a match occurs. If the Payment Key received during Payment Data Submission exists within System Data Exchange step the act of adding inputting outputting editing deleting viewing moving copying publishing synchronizing and or any other data manipulation of Content as well as the use of optical character recognition OCR to extract machine readable data from human readable data to and or from System occurs. Additionally Data Linking step the act of utilizing one or more characters and or one or more groups of one or more characters of Credential and or Content to associate Content with one or more Accounts and or associate Content with other Content occurs. If the Payment Key received during Payment Data Submission does not exist within System the operation ends step typically with an error to the entity submitting the Credentials.

Once the System has performed Data Exchange the System can perform certain actions on the data to create new data or other value. For instance the data stored in or associated with the System herein referred to as Content can be used to calculate rewards for one or more customers and validate coupons. Further the System can share Content with Third Parties and Third Party Systems to save Customers time by for example automatically registering Products with manufacturers. In summary where Data Exchange focused on the input and output of data Data Processing is related to all of the actions that can be taken on the data.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates an enrichment method . Because the Content is stored and or accessible to the System said Content can be enhanced when paired with additional data provided by or on behalf of System herein referred to as Enrichment Data . Enrichment Data essentially enhances and expands existing Company data providing more value or by creating new data. For example if a zip code is part of Company Data Enrichment Data could be demographic information about that zip code region.

Enrichment Key Analysis step the act of identifying Enrichment Keys that exist in both Company Data and Enrichment Data occurs. Next Enrichment Key Processing step the act of associating Enrichment Data with Company Data using Enrichment Keys occurs.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a reward method . The method utilizes Content and Payment Data to calculate and optionally fulfill Rewards for one or more Customers. One advantage of the methods and systems is its ability to manage a universal Rewards program where Customers could earn Rewards whenever they engage in a Transaction with any Company that utilizes the System versus the traditional process where Rewards are accumulated on a Company by Company basis. Further Rewards can be calculated by aggregating Customer data such that a group of Customers could earn more rewards than a single Customer alone. As an example the concept of a group or clique or a group of Customers that are associated together in some way within the system could allow a Company to increase its sales while allowing the Customers to earn additional Rewards by meeting the Rewards criteria jointly. Finally Rewards can be fulfilled in a variety of ways. For example a credit could be issued to a credit card used or a check could be mailed for the Reward amount.

Rewards Analysis step the act of identifying if any Reward Rules apply occurs. Next Rewards Processing step the act of calculating and or fulfilling Rewards based on Reward Rules occurs.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a coupon method . One advantages of the System is its ability to allow Companies to set thresholds for Coupons which are calculated after each Coupon Validation is done. For instance maybe a Company would like to offer 10 off everything in the store but is only willing to fund up to 500 or maybe the same Company only wants to offer redemptions for the first ten Customers. Once the System validates the Coupon step it can then lower the count available based on the criteria. Further another advantage of the System is that the Coupon Submission can be handled in a variety of ways from SMS to a phone call. If the coupon is not valid step the method ends step otherwise coupon processing is performed step .

Coupon Presentment step the act of presenting a Coupon to a Company occurs. Next Coupon Submission step the act of Coupon ID being received by System occurs. Next Coupon Analysis step the act of comparing a Coupon ID received during Coupon Submission with Coupon IDs that exist is System to identify if there is a match occurs. If the Coupon ID received during Coupon Submission exists within System Coupon Processing step the act of providing approval or decline for Coupon redemption and based on approval or decline adjusting the coupon counts and or other associated data occurs. As mentioned above this step can include reduces the number of Coupons left for redemption. If the Coupon ID received during Coupon Submission does not exist in the System the process would end step and could provide an error.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates a sharing method . The method allows Content to be shared with Third Parties and Third Party Systems based on Sharing Rules. This allows the Content to be used in useful and unique ways. For instance the System could automatically register products with manufacturers when the Product Keys or GTINs are identified on a receipt. Or the Company Data could be shared with social networks such as Facebook and the like allowing the Company to enter information once and have it distributed through multiple channels.

Sharing Analysis step the act of identifying if any Sharing Rules apply occurs. Next Sharing Processing step the act of sharing Content and or Payment Data based on Sharing Rules occurs.

In an exemplary embodiment the server can be part of one or more devices in the cloud offering services to customers and companies to create the channel . For example the server can be a centralized repository of information for the channel . The customers can have applications on their devices i.e. the devices such as a browser plug in that can identify transactions using the Payment Keys and provide access to the channel which is hosted in the cloud and or on the server . The company can interact with the channel through the server providing virtually any type of information to the customer. The customer can activate the channel once the application on their device determines a transaction is associated with the channel . For example assume the customer is viewing transaction data online e.g. on a website in a software package etc. the application can provide some indicia that a particular transaction is part of the channel . For example in a website the browser plug in could display an icon over the transaction. The user could click on or over the icon and information could be displayed in the channel i.e. a pop up a menu a click through etc.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a payment network is illustrated showing an overlaid system implementing the systems and methods described herein to offer the channel on the existing payment network . The payment network includes a customer making a purchase from a retailer which sends the data to an acquirer which sends the data to an issuer . As described herein transaction and or payment data flows between these entities . Of course legal monetary exchange also occurs whereby the retailer receives payment for the goods or services from the customer through the acquirer and the issuer . Note those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the payment network is shown for illustration purposes and any number of different architectures could be used. Further while referred to a customer and retailer these entities could be payor payee merchant company etc. Of note there is payment data that is provided through the payment network in addition to value exchange. It is via this payment data that the systems and methods enable the channel between the customer and the retailer .

The overlaid system implements the various systems and methods described herein with respect to the channel and the associated methods. Of note the overlaid system sits on or is in addition to the existing payment network . There is no requirement to modify the existing payment network which is a key advantage to leverage the channel . The overlaid system can be formed by one or more servers such as the server as well as one or more devices such as the smart devices . That is the overlaid system can be a server for interfacing with the merchants retailers etc. for defining payment keys and the like. The overlaid system can further be client side devices for users to identify transactions that match the payment key to open up the associated channel . The overlaid system is not necessarily tied to the issuer or the acquirer . Rather the overlaid system can interoperate with all issuers or acquires thus expanding the usefulness and scope of the channel . As such the overlaid system focuses on interoperating with existing payment networks within associated confines related to static data as well as being able to operate across many different payment networks concurrently.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flow diagram illustrates an exemplary method using the overlaid system . Customer makes Payment to Company step which enters Payment into Device step . Device then transmits Payment to Processor step . Alternatively Company could utilize Device to transmit Payment to Aggregator step which in turn transmits the Payment to Processor step . The Processor then transmits Payment to Acquirer step which interacts with Issuer through Associations steps . The Issuer then debits the Customer step and the Acquirer credits the Company step . This completes Payment Processing. Next Company populates System with Company Data step . In avoidance of doubt the Company Data and other Content can be provided to System from any authorized entity or system in the process including Devices which could transmits Transaction Data for example. The Customer can receive the content published by Company or Third Parties or Third Party Systems in three primary ways based on this example. First the Customer could use local software such as browser extension to transmit Payment data to System step to match Company and display Company Data. Second Issuer could transmit Payment Data to System step to match Company and display Company data when Customer views Payment Data provided by Issuer via paper or online statement step . Third PFM can gather Payment Data from Issuer step then transmit Payment Data to System step to match Company and display Company data when Customer views Payment Data Customer views Payment Data provided by PFM via paper or online statement step .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flowchart illustrates an exemplary payment method . A Customer makes a Payment to a Company step which enters the Payment into a Device step . For example the Device could be without limitation a point of sale POS device a credit debit card reader a near field communication device a cash register an online payment site and the like. The exemplary method can use a processor or aggregator step . The Device can transmit the Payment to a Processor step . Alternatively the Company could utilize the Device to transmit the Payment to an Aggregator step which in turn transmits the Payment to the Processor step . The Processor then transmits the Payment to an Acquirer step which interacts with an Issuer through Associations step . The Issuer then debits the Customer step and the Acquirer credits the Company step . This completes Payment Processing step . Next the Company populates a System with Company Data step . In avoidance of doubt the Company Data and other Content can be provided to the System from any authorized entity or system in the process including Devices which could transmit Transaction Data for example. The Customer can receive the Payment Data three primary ways based on this example but other ways or methods are contemplated step . First the Customer could use local software such as browser extension to transmit Payment Data to the System to match Company and display Company Data. Second the Issuer could transmit Payment Data to the System to match the Company and display Company Data when Customer views Payment Data provided by the Issuer via paper or online statement. Third A PFM can gather Payment Data from the Issuer then transmit Payment Data to the System to match the Company and display Company Data when Customer views Payment Data Customer views Payment Data provided by the PFM via paper or online statement. When viewing the Payment Data if there is a Payment Key match step the channel can be enabled step .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a flow diagram illustrates a channel method . First a Company publishes content to the overlaid system step . This content can be anything enabled by the channel as described herein. Next a customer logs into an online banking site a personal finance manager PFM site a mobile application etc. step . Payment transaction data is transmitted from the site to the overlaid system for matching step and upon matching the overlaid system returns published content for the matches step . The published content is displayed to the customer step .

While the systems and methods utilize known values that do not need to match a business name the Payment Key i.e. the combination of all static field values can appear in different places within the payment data on an issuer by issuer basis. Therefore in addition to its unique approach and systems for matching the merchants the system also employs logic to find the matching value within a set of data. Typically it can be done with a wild card search.

In addition while the system can rely on multiple data fields not just the merchant name field some fields can be truncated by the issuer. Therefore the system could employ logic to identify probability of a match based on the number of fields matched and the number of characters within the field matched. Again the values are irrelevant and have not to do with the probability . . . it is simply a probability based on the number of characters of a Payment Key present in the payment data. While the system will likely not accept anything less than a 100 probability match the present inventions allows for and contemplates the case of a less than 100 match.

As described herein conventional systems and methods have constraints in being able to accurately identify individual merchants and locations relying on narrow merchant name data solely. Advantageously the systems and methods described herein do not require even a portion of the merchant s business name to be able to identify the merchant from a specified set of transaction data. This novel aspect is a driving factor in enabling creation of the channel since every the transaction data can be completely and accurately correlated to a specific merchant and location. Furthermore the systems and methods described herein are able to not only identify the merchant and location but also the specific device that was involved in the transaction.
