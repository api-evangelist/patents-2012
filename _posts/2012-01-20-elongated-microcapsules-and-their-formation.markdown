This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 442 477 filed on Feb. 14 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and by an employee of the United States Government and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96 517 35 U.S.C. 202 and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202 the contractor elected not to retain title.

The present invention relates generally to microcapsules and their formation. More particularly this invention is related to elongated microcapsules.

Microcapsules have been used for various applications. Normally microcapsules are synthesized in spherical or somewhat spherical shapes. Recently microcapsules have been used for smart coatings for corrosion applications. For instance the pH sensitive microcapsules disclosed by Li and Calle in 2009 NACE International conference paper 09499 and 2007 NACE International conference paper 07228 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 790 225 B1 Luz Calle et al. issued Sep. 7 2010 have been used for the controlled release of a corrosion indicator or a corrosion inhibitor or a self healing agent when corrosion occurs. Mechanically breakable microcapsules are also used in self healing composite disclosed by White et al. in Nature 2001 409 794 797.

There are few disclosures on making elongated capsules around or above 1 mm but not on making elongated microcapsules below 100 microns . For instance Aebischer et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 418 154 prepared elongated seamless capsules containing biological materials by extruding the capsule core content and the polymeric casting solution through two concentric bores. However there are a number of shortcomings in this approach. The size of the capsule is limited by the size of the bores which makes it difficult to form small microcapsules i.e. smaller than 200 microns. The scale up of the process requires additional equipment set up the cost of mass production can be very high and even forbidden for many industries such as the coating industry or composite applications.

Thus there exists a need for better techniques for synthesis of elongated microcapsules for producing microcapsules about or below 200 microns as well as suitable for scale up for industrial production.

This invention permits formation of elongated microcapsules from an emulsion system. Microencapsulation techniques based on emulsion processes are often used to produce microcapsules by incorporating the core content in the dispersed phase and forming solid walls around the dispersed phase droplets. Spherical or somewhat spherically shaped microcapsules are normally formed due to the interfacial tension between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase.

In the present invention elongated microcapsules such as elongated hydrophobic core and hydrophilic core microcapsules may be formed by pulse stirring an emulsion or shearing an emulsion between two surfaces moving at different velocities. The term velocities throughout this document refers to vector velocity including a directional component. Thus two surfaces moving at different velocities may have the same absolute velocity value but different directions.

One embodiment of the invention provides a composition comprising capsules having a solid shell and an interior core wherein at least a portion of the capsules are elongated microcapsules.

Another embodiment provides a method of treating a surface comprising a applying a coating to the surface wherein the coating comprises elongated microcapsules dispersed in a coating vehicle the elongated microcapsules having an interior content comprising a corrosion indicator a corrosion inhibitor a self healing agent or a film forming compound and b releasing the interior content of the elongated microcapsules in the presence of corrosion or upon physical trauma.

Another embodiment provides a method of detecting corrosion comprising a applying a coating on a metal containing surface the coating comprising elongated microcapsules dispersed in a coating vehicle the microcapsules comprising an indicator b releasing the indicator and c detecting the presence of corrosion using the indicator wherein releasing the indicator is caused by an alkaline condition resulting from corrosion that breaks down shells of elongated microcapsules exposed to the alkaline condition or by physical trauma.

Another embodiment provides a method of forming a composite material comprising incorporating elongated microcapsules into a matrix to form a composite material comprising elongated microcapsules dispersed in the matrix wherein the elongated microcapsules have a solid shell and an interior core wherein the interior core comprises a self healing compound.

Another embodiment provides a method of healing a composite material the composite material comprising a matrix and elongated microcapsules dispersed in the matrix wherein the elongated microcapsules have a solid shell and an interior core wherein the interior core comprises a self healing compound the method comprising a releasing the self healing compound from the elongated microcapsules in response to physical trauma that fractures or tears the composite material and breaks some of the elongated microcapsules wherein the self healing compound heals the fracture or tear.

Another embodiment provides a composite material comprising a matrix and elongated microcapsules dispersed in the matrix wherein the elongated microcapsules have a solid shell and an interior core wherein the interior core comprises a self healing compound. In one embodiment the matrix comprises a polymer.

Another embodiment provides a method for forming elongated microcapsules comprising a forming an emulsion b shearing the emulsion between two surfaces moving at different velocities to form a sheared emulsion and c forming solid shells around droplets in the emulsion to form elongated microcapsules. The steps may be performed simultaneously. For instance the steps of forming an emulsion shearing the emulsion could be executed by placing components of the mixture between the two surfaces and then moving the surfaces at different velocities.

Another embodiment provides a method for forming elongated microcapsules comprising a forming an emulsion b stirring the emulsion using pulsed stirring and c forming solid shells around droplets in the emulsion to form elongated microcapsules.

In the following detailed description of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural logical and chemical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Elongated microcapsules may be more efficient at delivering their contents e.g. in response to breaking down when exposed to corrosion e.g. a basic condition or to a mechanical trauma because an elongated microcapsule may be able to release more of their content such as a healing agent corrosion indicator and or corrosion inhibitor than a spherical microcapsule when a crack is initiated in a coating. Elongated microcapsules are particularly suited for releasing their contents in response to a crack or to a mechanical trauma e.g. an impact or scratch . A crack is more likely to intersect an extended hollow fiber at some point than a sphere of the same diameter as the hollow fiber. Likewise it is more likely to intersect an elongated capsule than a spherical capsule with the same diameter as the short axis of the elongated capsule. A trauma or mechanical force is also more likely to break an elongated capsule than a spherical capsule because the elongated capsule has flat and in some cases concave surfaces while a perfect sphere has only convex surfaces which are more structurally stable than flat or concave surfaces.

The film forming compound by forming a solid film on the surface can seal the surface and thereby protect it from water and oxygen and prevent further corrosion.

The elongated microcapsules may also comprise in their interior core a self healing compound. A self healing compound is a compound that on its own or on reaction with another component heals a crack or break in a material. Many of the film forming compounds are also self healing compounds. One example of a self healing compound is a monomer or pre polymer that polymerizes when released from the microcapsules. One example is dicyclopentadiene DCPD in the microcapsules where Grubb s catalyst is embedded in the matrix so when the microcapsules release the DCPD it polymerizes by contact with the catalyst to form a cross linked polymer network White et al. 2001 Nature 409 794 797 . Some of the film forming compounds discussed above are also self healing compounds. Self healing may be used where the matrix is a polymer which may be cross linked by the polymer formed from the self healing compound. Also like the film forming compounds two reacting self healing compounds may be found in separate microcapsules so the two components react when both populations of microcapsules break and release their interior core content.

The term elongated microcapsules refers to capsules where the aspect ratio a b is greater than 1.0 and where the shorter dimension b is about or less than 100 microns. In some embodiments the aspect ratio is greater than 1.1 greater than 1.2 greater than 1.3 greater than 1.4 greater than 1.5 greater than 1.7 greater than 2.0 or greater than 5.

The interior core of the elongated microcapsules may comprise a colorimetric or fluorescent indicator that changes color or fluoresces when corrosion occurs e.g. when exposed to corrosion product . In other embodiments it may comprise a corrosion inhibitor or a film forming compound.

In some embodiments shell is broken down or disintegrates in the presence of a base e.g. at a pH above about 8 and releases interior core . Microcapsules having shells that break down under basic or alkaline conditions are known in the art. For example a microcapsule may be formed by forming an oil e.g. toluene or vegetable oil in water emulsion. A surfactant such as xanthan gum Attagel 40 available from Engelhard Corp. Iselin N.J. USA Petro BAF available from Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. Chicago Ill. USA and or Reax 83 available from MeadWestvaco Corp. Stamford Conn. USA is added to the emulsion to evenly distribute the oil in the water. A pre polymer such as an amino resin pre polymer a cross linking agent having one or more ester or thioester groups that are broken down under basic conditions and interior core are added to the oil phase. An initiator or catalyst such as an inorganic acid is added to the water phase. The oil in water emulsion is heated causing a polymerization reaction to occur at the water oil interface which forms solid shell around interior core . It is the interaction of alkaline conditions with functional groups of the cross linking agent that causes shell to break down under alkaline conditions. Alternatively interior core can be released under physical stress such as by scratching or compressing coating on a surface.

For one embodiment coating is temporarily applied to a metal containing surface e.g. by spraying brushing or rolling to determine whether corrosion has occurred. For this embodiment coating vehicle may be an aqueous gel and interior core may include a suitable corrosion indicator such as the colorimetric or fluorescent indicator as described above. In the presence of corrosion the shells of the microcapsules break down releasing the indicator. The indicator will change color or fluoresce to indicate the presence of corrosion. Coating vehicle is not limited to an aqueous gel but can be a clear paint or varnish opaque paint or varnish etc. It may be substantially permanently applied to the metal containing surface by spraying brushing or rolling. For one embodiment coating may be applied substantially permanently to a bare metal surface as a primer coat that is clear coated. Another example of a temporary coating is a water suspension of microcapsules .

In some embodiments interior core may include the indicator a corrosion inhibitor a film forming compound or some combination thereof. If the shells break down due to exposure to a basic pH condition the interior core is released and the corrosion inhibitor acts to prevent further corrosion while the indicator indicates the location of corrosion. A self healing agent or film forming compound can repair coating damage to help prevent further corrosion or damage to the metal.

In another embodiment a physical trauma such as a scratch or impact to the coating may act to expose the metal. The trauma can also break shells to release the interior core . Elongated microcapsules are particularly suited for release in response to physical trauma because the elongated microcapsules are more susceptible to breakage due to physical force than spherical microcapsules are. Release of a film forming compound and or self healing agents in the interior core after physical trauma can seal or protect the metal containing surface before any corrosion has happened.

Note that if corrosion occurs at locations away from the trauma location e.g. due to small defects in the coating such as air bubbles corrosion inhibitor and film forming compound will be released due to the shells breaking down in the presence of the basic pH condition resulting from corrosion. In other embodiments the indicator will indicate the presence of the corrosion.

For one embodiment a portion of microcapsules in coating may contain a corrosion inhibitor and another portion of microcapsules may contain a corrosion indicator and another portion may contain a film forming compound.

In some embodiments microcapsules having different contents are randomly distributed within coating vehicle so that microcapsules having the different functions of indicating inhibiting and or film forming or sealing may be adjacent to each other as well as microcapsules having like functions being adjacent to each other.

One embodiment of the invention provides a composition comprising capsules having a solid shell and an interior core wherein at least a portion of the capsules are elongated microcapsules.

In particular embodiments the interior core of the elongated microcapsules comprises a colorimetric or fluorescent indicator that changes color or fluoresces when exposed to corrosion or the interior core comprises a corrosion inhibitor a film forming compound or a self healing compound. For instance the colorimetric or fluorescent indicator may change color or become fluorescent when exposed to alkaline pH resulting from corrosion or when exposed to metal ions resulting from corrosion.

In particular embodiments the composition is adapted to release the interior core content of the microcapsules in response to physical trauma i.e. mechanical forces . For example the trauma may be an impact or a scratch.

In particular embodiments the composition is a coating composition adapted to cover and adhere to a metal containing surface. This refers to a coating that is permanent or semi permanent such as a paint varnish or sealant.

In particular embodiments the solid shell of the elongated microcapsules comprises a polymer wherein the shell does not comprise a component that breaks down under basic pH.

In specific embodiments the shell of the microcapsules breaks down when exposed to alkaline conditions. An example is shells made with a cross linker that contains ester or thioester bonds. The ester and thioester bonds hydrolyze at an appreciable rate at alkaline pH causing the shell to break down and release the interior core volume.

Thus in more specific embodiments the solid shell comprises polymer segments interconnected with each other by a cross linker wherein the cross linker hydrolyzes in an alkaline condition. An example is penta erythritol tetrakis 3 mercaptopropionate PTT . In other embodiments the solid shell may not comprise a polymer. For instance microcapsules with a wax shell can be made by methods known in the art.

Preferably at least 50 volume percent of the capsules in the composition are elongated microcapsules. In other specific embodiments at least 30 volume percent at least 40 volume percent at least 60 volume percent at least 70 volume percent at least 80 volume percent or at least 90 volume percent of the capsules are elongated microcapsules.

One embodiment provides a method for forming elongated microcapsules comprising a forming an emulsion b stirring the emulsion using pulsed stirring and c forming solid shells around droplets in the emulsion to form elongated microcapsules.

As described in Example 1 below droplet size in an emulsion is directly affected by mixing speed the higher the mixing speed the smaller the dispersed phase droplets are. In an emulsion system with intermediate stability droplets of the dispersed phase will start to coalesce to form bigger droplets. This can happen after mixing is slowed or stopped. If the encapsulation occurs during this coalescence phase elongated microcapsules are formed. Pulsed stirring as described above is one way to achieve this.

In a specific embodiment of the pulse stirring method the method further comprises harvesting the elongated microcapsules and mixing the elongated microcapsules with one or more other components to form an adherent coating composition.

In specific embodiments the pulsed stirring comprises repeating a process of mixing the emulsion for a particular time and stopping the mixing for a particular other time. In other embodiments the pulsed stirring comprises mixing the emulsion at one faster mixing speed for a particular time and then mixing at a second slower mixing speed for a particular other time. The cycle of those two steps faster and slower mixing or mixing and stopping mixing may occur only once or may optionally be repeated two or more times.

The emulsion may comprise hydrophobic droplets dispersed in a hydrophilic phase or hydrophilic droplets dispersed in a hydrophobic phase.

Elongated droplets in an emulsion and microcapsules from the droplets are formed with a balance between two main forces. The interfacial stress surface tension and the viscous force shear caused by flow determine the deformation and stability of a droplet in a shear field or a flowing liquid phase. Shear stress and the viscous force can be generated by stirring a fluid particularly by the flow along the surface of a container containing the fluid. It can also be generated by the relative movement of two surfaces. The parallel band apparatus shown in is one apparatus that can generate these shear forces. Rollers move fabric bands . The two fabric bands move in opposite directions and so place a shear force on droplet that is located between the two surfaces .

Thus one embodiment of the invention provides a method for forming elongated microcapsules comprising a forming an emulsion b shearing the emulsion between two surfaces moving at different velocities to form a sheared emulsion and c forming solid shells around droplets in the emulsion to form elongated microcapsules. Some or all of the steps can be carried out sequentially or some or all of the steps can be carried out together. For instance all of the components can be added to the same container and immediately sheared so the mixing forming an emulsion and shearing the emulsion occur together. If the initiator was added at the same time as the other components the forming solid shells around droplets also can be said to begin at the same time that the other steps occur.

In specific embodiments the elongated microcapsules are formed continuously. One apparatus for this purpose is a screw and barrel type apparatus as shown in . A polymer extruder is one example of this apparatus and it can be used or modified to perform this operation. The screw is positioned within barrel or cylinder . The mixture flows between the screw and the barrel and rotation of the screw can move the mixture from point a at the right of to point c at the left. The mixture may be formed in hopper and added to the apparatus through feed throat at point a . The screw is rotated by drive unit to transport the mixture toward point c . The motion of the screw in the barrel in addition to transporting the mixture also forms a sheared emulsion by virtue of the screw moving relative to the wall of the barrel and shearing the emulsion between those two surfaces. A feeder may be positioned at an intermediate point b and an initiator may be added at this point b through the feeder to initiate formation of solid shells around the sheared droplets in the sheared emulsion. Elongated microcapsules are collected at point c .

At the intermediate point b of the apparatus the mixture can be treated to initiate formation of solid shells around the droplets to form elongated microcapsules. The treatment can be e.g. heating or adding an initiator through a passageway of the outer barrel or both. Alternatively the treatment can be at point a e.g. by adding the initiator with the other components to form the mixture and then quickly shearing the mixture to form a sheared emulsion with the initiator in it.

Other apparatuses or geometries for carrying out continuous production of elongated microcapsules can also be used. For instance the mixture can be transported through a relatively narrow channel at a constant rate while at different points of the channel it may be rapidly stirred and then the stirring stopped as the mixture continues to move linearly downstream. At the beginning point or at an intermediate point along the channel initiation of forming the solid shells can be performed.

Shell formation can be initiated by adding an initiator or by a treatment such as raising or lowering the temperature in certain cases. The initiator can be a catalyst such as sulfuric acid or another acid which is not consumed in the polymerization reactions described in the Examples or it could be a reagent that is consumed such as a pre polymer or cross linker or monomer for a polymerization or cross linking reaction or ammonium persulfate for polymerization of polycrylamide.

Thus one embodiment of the methods comprises transporting the mixture in space from point a to point b to point c wherein the sheared emulsion is formed between points a and c treating the sheared emulsion at point a or b to initiate formation of the solid shells and harvesting elongated microcapsules at point c.

In one embodiment the two surfaces moving at different velocities are a screw inside a barrel where the screw and barrel rotate relative to each other. The rotation may be due to absolute rotation of one surface with the other surface stationary e.g. rotation of the screw inside a stationary barrel.

In another embodiment the two surfaces moving at different velocities are a shaft and a tube e.g. a rotating shaft and a stationary tube a disc and a plate e.g. a rotating disc and a stationary plate a cone and a plate or a second cone e.g. a rotating cone and a stationary plate and a screw and a barrel e.g. a rotating screw and a stationary barrel .

In one embodiment the method involving shearing the emulsion between two surfaces moving at different velocities comprises harvesting the elongated microcapsules and mixing the elongated microcapsules with one or more other components to form an adherent coating composition. A coating composition refers to a composition that is adapted to form a permanent or semi permanent coating on a surface e.g. a paint varnish or sealant.

In specific embodiments of the methods the emulsion comprises hydrophobic droplets in a hydrophilic phase or hydrophilic droplets in a hydrophobic phase.

Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of treating a surface comprising a applying a coating to the surface wherein the coating comprises elongated microcapsules dispersed in a coating vehicle the elongated microcapsules having an interior content comprising a corrosion indicator a corrosion inhibitor or a film forming compound and b releasing the interior content of the elongated microcapsules in the presence of corrosion or upon physical trauma.

In one embodiment step b comprises releasing the interior content of the elongated microcapsules in the presence of corrosion wherein the release is caused by an alkaline condition resulting from corrosion that breaks down shells of elongated microcapsules exposed to the alkaline condition.

In another embodiment step b comprises releasing the content of the elongated microcapsules in response to physical trauma.

It was found that elongated oil core microcapsules could be formed according to process of . For example the water phase in step may be prepared by respectively dissolving water soluble surfactants such as xanthan gum Petro BAF powder and ATTAGEL 40 in the water one at a time while stirring. For example the water phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 97.7 percent water about 0.1 percent xanthan gum about 0.2 percent Petro BAF and about 2.0 percent ATTAGEL 40 where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase formed in step was prepared by adding shell forming compound such as CYMEL U80 to toluene and ethanol and stirring e.g. using the Powergen 500 homogenizer until mixed. For example the oil phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 12.8 percent CYMEL U80 about 59.8 percent toluene and about 27.4 percent ethanol where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase is dispersed into the water phase by stirring to make the oil in water emulsion in step e.g. where the oil in water emulsion may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 31 percent by mass oil phase and about 69 percent by mass water phase. A catalyst such as 4N HSOmay be added in step e.g. a drop at a time to the oil in water emulsion while stirring. The emulsion may then be heated in step to initiate an interfacial polymerization reaction thereby forming elongated oil core microcapsules.

Hydrophilic core microcapsules can be formed by processes shown in the flow charts of . In this case the shell forming compound may be in the oil phase. A water soluble catalyst such as H2SO4 can be added to start the reaction it will partition to the aqueous phase and thereby initiate polymerization of the shell forming compound such as CYMEL U80 at the oil water interface. Alternatively hydrophilic core microcapsules can be formed with a more water soluble shell forming compound. For instance melamine formaldehyde prepolymer or urea formaldehyde prepolymer can be used as the shell forming compound.

It should be noted that the oil phase used during the formation of some oil core microcapsules included a shell forming compound having a suitable cross linking agent such as penta erythritol tetrakis 3 mercaptopropionate PTT . This cross linking agent results in a desirable combination of the pH sensitivity and the structural integrity of the shell. That is the cross linking agent provides one or more ester groups that are broken down under basic conditions thus enabling the shell of the microcapsule to be broken down when exposed to a basic alkaline condition. Note that the cross linking agent may be eliminated from the shell forming compound in the oil phase during the formation of the elongated oil core microcapsules in Example 1. For example in Example 1 Table 2 the shell forming compound contains the pre polymer CYMEL U80 without the cross linking agent. As such the elongated oil core microcapsules cannot be broken down when exposed to a basic alkaline condition. However the shell of the elongated microcapsules thus formed will be thinner and more brittle and can be broken mechanically to release their content.

In addition the oil in water emulsion used in the formation of the elongated microcapsules in Example 1 was less stable e.g. a poorer dispersion of oil phase droplets within the emulsion where the droplets more likely combine with each other owing to the elimination of a surfactant e.g. REAX 83A in the water phase used to promote the stability of the emulsion.

The thinner more brittle shell resulting from the elimination of the PTT causes the microcapsule to be more susceptible to breakage by mixing during the encapsulation process. This causes the formation of elongated microcapsules. In addition the less stable emulsion resulting from the elimination of REAX 83A produces oil phase droplets of varying size in the emulsion that are constantly forming deforming and breaking. Under these conditions some of the oil phase droplets were deformed into elongated shapes that lasted long enough as the continuous phase is viscous to form the capsule shell. Some capsules are also broken after the capsule walls are formed and release some of the pre polymer to form tail like structures that ultimately form elongated microcapsules.

In another example the water phase is prepared by respectively dissolving xanthan gum Petro BAF powder and ATTAGEL 40 in the water one at a time while stirring. For example the water phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 97.7 percent water about 0.1 percent xanthan gum about 0.2 percent Petro BAF and about 2.0 percent ATTAGEL 40 where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase was prepared by adding CYMEL U80 to toluene and stirring e.g. using the Powergen 500 homogenizer until mixed. For example the oil phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 26.3 percent CYMEL U80 and about 73.7 percent toluene where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase is dispersed into the water phase by stirring to make the oil in water emulsion e.g. where the oil in water emulsion comprises consists of or consists essentially of about 43 percent by mass oil phase and about 57 percent by mass water phase. A catalyst such as 4N HSO may be added dropwise to the oil in water emulsion while stirring. The emulsion may then be heated to initiate an interfacial polymerization reaction thereby forming elongated oil core microcapsules.

Increasing the proportion of the oil phase such as in Example 1 Table 3 produced more elongated microcapsules and microcapsules with larger aspect ratios e.g. compared to Example 1 Table 2. It was found that the surfactant concentration in the water phase and the proportion of the oil phase in the emulsion has a significant effect on the amount of elongated oil core microcapsules and their aspect ratios. Because the majority of elongated capsules are relatively larger increasing the proportion of the oil phase increases the amount of larger oil phase droplets resulting in more elongated microcapsules and elongated microcapsules with larger aspect ratios.

Emulsion size is directly affected by the mixing speed e.g. the higher the mixing speed the smaller the dispersed oil phase drops e.g. oil phase drop size . In an emulsion system with intermediate stability e.g. resulting from the elimination of REAX 83A the droplets of the dispersed phase will start to coalesce to form bigger droplets. If the encapsulation occurs during the coalescence process elongated microcapsules will be formed.

For example in Example 1 Approach II the water phase may be prepared by dissolving ATTAGEL 40 in the water while stirring. For example the water phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 99.0 percent water and about 1.0 percent ATTAGEL 40 where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase was prepared by adding CYMEL U80 to toluene and ethanol and stirring e.g. using the Powergen 500 homogenizer until mixed. For example the oil phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 13.0 percent CYMEL U80 about 60.9 percent toluene and about 26.1 percent ethanol where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase is dispersed into the water phase by stirring e.g. using the Powergen 500 homogenizer at about 4000 rpm to make the oil in water emulsion e.g. where the oil in water emulsion comprises consists of or consists essentially of about 31 percent by mass oil phase and about 69 percent by mass water phase. The emulsion is then heated and a catalyst such as 4N HSO added to the heated emulsion to initiate a polymerization reaction. The emulsion is then mixed by a pulsed mixing process. For example each pulse includes mixing the emulsion at about 15000 rpm for a particular time e.g. a couple of minutes and stopping mixing for a particular other time e.g. about 10 minutes . The pulses are repeated until elongated microcapsules are formed.

A liquid drop can be deformed under shear conditions and it is possible to make elongated microcapsules from an emulsion under these conditions. For example an emulsion may be placed between two surfaces moving at different velocities to cause the emulsion to flow as a shear flow. For example one surface may be stationary while the other is moving.

For one embodiment elongated microcapsules were formed by placing an oil in water emulsion between a shaft rotating in a stationary tube e.g. a tube closed at one of its ends and the sidewall of the stationary tube to produce a shear flow of the oil in water emulsion between the rotating shaft and the sidewall of the stationary tube. For example in Example 2 an oil in water emulsion was formed from a water phase prepared by respectively dissolving xanthan gum Petro BAF powder and ATTAGEL 40 in the water one at a time while stirring. For example the water phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 97.7 percent water about 0.1 percent xanthan gum about 0.2 percent Petro BAF and about 2.0 percent ATTAGEL 40 where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase was prepared by adding CYMEL U80 to toluene and stirring e.g. using the Powergen 500 homogenizer until mixed. For example the oil phase may comprise consist of or consist essentially of about 26.3 percent CYMEL U80 and about 73.7 percent toluene where the percents are mass percents. The oil phase is dispersed into the water phase by stirring to make the oil in water emulsion e.g. where the oil in water emulsion comprises consists of or consists essentially of about 43 percent by mass oil phase and about 57 percent by mass water phase. The oil in water emulsion was then added to the tube and the shaft was rotated within the tube causing the oil in water emulsion to flow under shear between the rotating shaft and the sidewall of the tube. A catalyst such as a five percent solution of HSO was added to the oil in water emulsion as it flowed under shear to initiate the polymerization reaction thereby forming elongated oil core microcapsules. It was found that increasing the viscosity of the oil in water emulsion e.g. by increasing the proportion of xanthan gum resulted smaller oil phase droplets in the emulsion and elongated microcapsules with higher aspect ratios.

For one embodiment elongated microcapsules were formed by placing an oil in water emulsion between a rotating disc and a stationary plate e.g. a stationary disc to produce a shear flow of the oil in water emulsion between the rotating disc and stationary plate. For example the oil in water emulsion comprised consisted of or consisted essentially of water phase with surfactants such as xanthan gum Petro BAF and ATTAGEL 40 and the oil phase included oil such as toluene with a shell forming pre polymer such as CYMEL U80. The oil phase was added to the water phase to form the oil in water emulsion and the oil in water emulsion was placed between the rotating disc and stationary plate causing the oil in water emulsion to flow under shear. When the oil phase was flowing under shear a catalyst such as an acid catalyst was added to flowing emulsion to initiate the polymerization reaction thereby producing elongated microcapsules.

For some embodiments the device of e.g. an extruder may be used to form elongated microcapsules by adjusting the space between the stationary barrel and a rotating screw as well as the rotating speed of the screw. The emulsion with the desired viscosity pre polymer and catalyst can be added through the hopper . The microcapsules with complete walls can be collected at outlet c . A feeding position between the hopper and outlet c may be used for adding the catalyst instead of at the beginning of the barrel via the hopper.

During operation the emulsion flows with an angular component between the stationary barrel and the rotating screw under shear. This produces elongated microcapsules. Screw threads move the emulsion as it is being sheared and thus any elongated microcapsules formed by the shearing action axially are transported linearly in the direction from point a to point c . For example the axial flow may be perpendicular e.g. substantially perpendicular to the angular direction. That is the emulsion and elongated microcapsules have angular and axial flow components as they move through the barrel.

During the shearing methods disclosed herein heat is generated by shearing. An advantage of extruders is that heat is generated and dissipated viscous dissipation throughout the fluid volume. This is a source of heat that can be used for processing thereby reducing the amount of heat that need to be added by heating the outside of the extruder. The shearing methods require a considerable amount of energy for the shearing but the shearing itself also produces heat that may reduce the amount of heat needed to initiate the polymerization reaction or to reduce the viscosity.

For self healing functional materials it is desirable to maximize the amount of liquid healing agents that can be delivered to the crack plane. One proposed way in which this can be accomplished is to use hollow tubes or fibers while others are exploring more sophisticated micro vascular networks. While those systems might be effective for specific applications they are not a practical solution for coatings applications. One possible practical solution is to use microcapsules with high aspect ratios or elongated microcapsules. Elongated microcapsules will have a more efficient healing ability because an elongated microcapsule can release more healing agent than a spherical microcapsule when a crack is initiated in the coating.

Although the potential advantage of using elongated microcapsules for self healing applications is clear it is difficult to make elongated microcapsules from an emulsion system because spherical microcapsules are normally formed due to the interfacial tension between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase.

Two approaches were taken to synthesize elongated microcapsules. The first method used an emulsion with intermediate stability. The second method involved applying shear condition to the emulsion. The experimental details are presented here.

Elongated microcapsules were formed for the first time unintentionally. An oil core pH sensitive microcapsule formula was modified. Table 1 shows the regular oil core pH sensitive microcapsule formula.

Table 1 shows a formula A that was modified. Two changes were made in this formula. The wall forming material is the prepolymer U80 without any crosslinker PTT . We found it formed a thin and brittle wall which is easy to break mechanically to release its content. The formula also eliminated one of the surfactants Reax83A which results in a more viscous yet less stable emulsion.

Formula A resulted in elongated microcapsules as shown in . More recently the experiment was repeated and a closer look revealed more elongated and some odd shaped microcapsules shown in .

Several factors contributed to the formation of elongated microcapsules when using Formula A. First the formula provides a thin and somewhat brittle wall making the microcapsule more susceptible to break by mixing during the encapsulation process. Second the change in surfactants resulted in an unstable and viscous emulsion with various size droplets in the emulsion that are constantly forming deforming and breaking. Under these conditions some bigger oil droplets were deformed into elongated shapes that lasted long enough as the continuous phase is viscous to form the capsule wall. Some capsules are also broken after the capsule walls are formed and release some of the prepolymer to form tail like structures as shown in .

Because the majority of elongated capsules are relatively bigger formula A was further modified by increasing the oil phase to increase the amount of bigger oil droplets. The new formula B is shown in Table 3. This formula resulted in more elongated microcapsules as well as a higher aspect ratio of these microcapsules as shown in .

In order to find the best formula for making elongated microcapsules oil phase composition water phase composition as well as water oil ratio were tested for their influence on the process. Results showed that the oil phase composition has a very small effect while the water phase composition surfactant concentration in the water phase as well as the water oil ratio have a more significant effect on the process.

In the last section a process to synthesize elongated microcapsules was described in which the capsule walls are formed while bigger droplets are deformed or when bigger capsules break and release unreacted pre polymer to form a tail like structure. There is a slightly different approach to make elongated microcapsules.

As mentioned earlier the emulsion size is directly affected by the mixing speed the higher the mixing speed the smaller the dispersed phase drop size. In an emulsion system with intermediate stability the droplets of the dispersed phase will start to coalesce to form bigger droplets. If the encapsulation occurs during the coalescence process elongated microcapsules will be formed.

Generally in order to make elongated microcapsules it is desirable to have an emulsion with an intermediate stability. An emulsion formula that is very stable can be easily obtained with mixing results in a homogenous droplet size distribution and stays in that stage for a long time. A very unstable emulsion will undergo phase separation as soon as the mixing stops. An emulsion with an intermediate stability will go through a relatively long transition period before the final phase separation. While a stable emulsion will result in perfectly spherical microcapsules a very unstable emulsion will undergo phase separation too soon for the encapsulation process to occur. An emulsion with intermediate stability will go through coalescence and other deformation processes during encapsulation to form elongated and other non spherically shaped microcapsules.

Other important emulsion properties to consider include surface tension and viscosity of the emulsion system. The higher the surface tension between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase the more likely it is for the dispersed phase to maintain its spherical shape the lower the viscosity of the continuous phase the faster it is for a deformed droplet to recover its spherical shape. Therefore lower surface tension and higher viscosity are preferred to form elongated microcapsules.

While the previous processes were successful in making elongated microcapsules the processes are not highly effective and difficult to control.

Two main forces the interfacial stress surface tension and the viscous force shear caused by flow determine the deformation and stability of a droplet in a shear field or flowing liquid phase . When a naturally buoyant drop is subjected to a local straining rate the steady state deformation is the result of the equilibrium between the viscous forces which tend to deform the drop and even break it and the interfacial force which attempts to recover the initial spherical shape.

A parallel band apparatus as shown in provides simple shear conditions that deform a droplet located between bands when the two bands are moving in opposite directions. It is possible to make elongated microcapsules from an emulsion under these conditions.

To envision the geometry of the experimental set up for simple shear conditions simple shear viscometers come to mind. Simple shear rheometers or viscometers are high precision continuously variable shear instruments in which the test fluid is sheared between rotating cylinders cones or plates under controlled stress or controlled rate conditions. Most rheometers depend on the relative rotation about a common axis of one of three tool geometries concentric cylinder cone and plate or parallel plates See .

The concentric cylinder and parallel plate geometries were chosen to be tested for the creation of elongated microcapsules.

A crude version of a concentric cylinder was set up using a mixer shaft rotating inside a centrifuge tube. While the gap between the wall of the centrifuge tube and the mixer rod might be slightly larger for an ideal concentric cylinder the experimental results were promising.

The starting water phase and oil phase compositions are shown in Table 4. 10 ml oil phase was added to 30 ml of the water phase to form the oil in water emulsion. 5 ml of the emulsion was added to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. A Servodyne mixer with a shaft diameter was used to provide the shear condition in the emulsion and 5 sulfuric acid was added dropwise until the pH is about 1 or 0 to initiate the polymerization reaction to form the capsule wall.

The results are shown in the pictures in . As the pictures show the bigger capsules were elongated and only some of the small ones remain spherical. The sample is not very homogenous and there are clusters of microcapsules where they seem more likely to be elongated in shape. It is possible that the cluster formation is due to the shear conditions that also elongate the microcapsules.

This experiment was repeated and the amount of gum added was adjusted to vary the viscosity. The starting water phase and oil phase are the same shown in the table above . 0.25 0.5 0.75 and 1 gram of gum were added into 30 ml of the water phase starting formula to form a very viscous water phase and then 10 ml oil phase were added to the water to form the oil in water emulsion. The Powergen homogenizer was used for mixing.

5 ml of the emulsion was added into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. A Servodyne mixer with a diameter shaft was used to provide the shear in the emulsion. 5 sulfuric acid was then added to initiate the polymerization reaction to form the capsule wall. The results are shown in and . The viscosity or the amount of gum clearly had an important effect on the emulsion and the elongation of the capsules. More gum seems to form smaller droplets in the emulsion and or higher aspect ratio capsules.

A crude version of a parallel concentric cylinder was set up using a polishing machine Struers TegraPol 11 . The polishing machine provides the plate that rotates at a controllable speed and another plate was held above the rotating plate while the emulsion was placed between the two plates. The emulsion included the water phase with surfactants and the oil phase with a wall forming pre polymer. After the steady state was reached acid was added to the emulsion to initiate the polymerization reaction that forms the capsule wall.

The resulting microcapsules are shown in the pictures in . The pictures show that elongated microcapsules with high aspect ratio were formed.

Two geometries were tested for simple shear conditions concentric cylinders and parallel plates. In both setups the dispersed phase liquid droplets with wall forming prepolymer inside was deformed under simple shear conditions. Then a catalyst was added to trigger the polymerization reaction to form the capsule wall. While both geometries were successful in making elongated microcapsules they were difficult to scale up for a continuous production operation.

To satisfy both the simple shear condition and continuous production the emulsion should be placed between two surfaces that are moving at different velocities. At the same time the emulsion should be transported from a starting position to a finish position during the wall formation reaction so that the microcapsules with complete walls can be collected at the finish position continuously.

Among the two simple shear geometries tested the concentric cylinder design can be modified to satisfy the continuous operation condition. For concentric cylinders there are two cylinder surfaces moving at different velocities. One design would include a stationary outside cylinder while the inside cylinder rotates. The emulsion is moving in an angular direction between the two cylinders. In order for the emulsion to move linearly from a starting point to a finishing point while it is under simple shear conditions the emulsion needs to move in both angular and axial directions. A natural design for this process is a screw and barrel design.

A well known design already exists and is used in the polymer industry the polymer extruder . It is possible to create the simple shear conditions that are needed to form elongated microcapsules by adjusting the space between the barrel and screw as well as the rotating speed of the extruder. The emulsion with the desired viscosity pre polymer and catalyst can be added at the hopper . The microcapsules with complete walls can be collected at the die . It is also possible to add a feeding position in the middle of the barrel so that the catalyst can be added there instead of at the beginning of the barrel. The polymer extruder design can be easily adapted to form elongated microcapsules under continuous operation.
