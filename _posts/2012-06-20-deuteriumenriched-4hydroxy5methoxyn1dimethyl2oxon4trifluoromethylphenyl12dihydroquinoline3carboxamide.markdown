In a recent randomized placebo controlled double blind phase II clinical study of ABR 215050 in patients with asymptomatic metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer a difference was shown in the number of patients with disease progression at six months. Indeed the results showed that the fraction of patients with disease progression during the six month period was 31 for patients treated with ABR 215050 compared to 66 for placebo treated patients p

In vivo animal experiments further have shown that ABR 215050 also has an efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Thus an in vivo animal experimental study has shown efficacy of the compound in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 5 and another one has shown its efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis 6 .

Deuterium H or D is a stable and non radioactive isotope of hydrogen which has approximately twice the mass of protium H or H the by far most common isotope of hydrogen. Deuteration of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics PK pharmacodynamics PD and toxicity profiles has been disclosed previously with some classes of drugs. For example it has been disclosed 7 that various deuteration patterns can be used to a reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites b increase the half life of the parent drug c decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect d decrease the amount of a dose needed to achieve a desired effect e increase the formation of active metabolites if any are formed f decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and or g create a more effective drug and or a safer drug for polypharmacy whether the polypharmacy be intentional or not. In 7 therefore deuteration of laquinimod is disclosed and it is stated that the deuteration approach has the strong potential to slow the metabolism of laquinimod

According to a first aspect there is provided a compound which is deuterium enriched 4 hydroxy 5 methoxy N 1 dimethyl 2 oxo N 4 trifluoromethyl phenyl 1 2 dihydro quinoline 3 carboxamide having a deuterium enrichment in the amide N methyl group of at least 70 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

There also is provided a method for preparing a deuterium enriched 4 hydroxy 5 methoxy N 1 dimethyl 2 oxo N 4 trifluoromethyl phenyl 1 2 dihydro quinoline 3 carboxamide having a deuterium enrichment in the amide N methyl group of at least 70 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by reacting a 4 hydroxy 5 methoxy 1 methyl 2 oxo 1 2 dihydro quinoline 3 carboxylic acid C1 C4 alkyl ester with deuterated N methyl p trifluoromethylaniline having a deuterium enrichment in the N methyl group of at least 70 in a suitable solvent and optionally reacting the obtained compound with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base.

The compound of the invention is useful as a medicament e.g. for use in the treatment of a malignant hyperproliferative disease or an autoimmune disease.

The compound of the invention also is useful as a medicament e.g. for use in the treatment of a disorder ameliorated by the modulation of immune function.

Consequently there also is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.

The inventive compound also is suitable for use in the prevention or treatment of a disorder selected from malignant hyperproliferative diseases and autoimmune diseases.

A method for the treatment of a mammal suffering from a malignant hyperproliferative disease also is provided. Furthermore a method for the treatment of a mammal suffering from an autoimmune disease is provided as well as a method for the treatment of a disorder that is ameliorated by the modulation of immune function.

As noted herein above ABR 215050 has shown promising results as a therapeutically active compound which may be useful in the treatment of various serious diseases.

ABR 215050 was tested with respect to its CYP1A inducing capability in vitro in a TV cell assay. This assay is a luciferase gene reporter assay developed for the measurement of AhR Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor mediated induction of CYP1A. Human CYP1A promoters and 5 flanking sequences were cloned into firefly luciferase expression vectors and stably integrated into the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 9 . The isolated cell line was renamed TV101L. This test showed that ABR 215050 did not induce CYP1A cf. herein below under In vitro assay of CYP1A inducing capacity of ABR 215050 .

Three demethylation metabolites of ABR 215050 were found in the rat i.e. the quinoline N demethylated metabolite referred to herein below as ABR 219694 the quinoline O demethylated metabolite ABR 222097 referred to herein below as ABR 222097 and the amide N demethylated metabolite referred to herein below as ABR 215691 cf. Table 1.

These metabolites too were tested in the TV cell assay. Just like ABR 215050 ABR 219694 and ABR 222097 were found not to induce CYP1A data not shown . Surprisingly it was found that in contrast to the parent compound and the two other demethylation metabolites ABR 215691 had a substantial CYP1A inducing capacity several magnitudes higher than that of the two other demethylated metabolites and the parent compound ABR 215050 itself cf. herein below under In vitro assay of CYP1A1 inducing capacity of ABR 215691 . It could be suspected that even at a very low concentration ABR 215691 could contribute substantially to CYP1A induction due to its very high inducing capacity.

The water solubility of ABR 215050 and of its metabolites also was investigated. It is a well known fact that metabolism in general aims to transform compounds to more water soluble entities 10 which mostly decreases toxicity but also facilitates renal elimination. Both ABR 219694 and ABR 222097 were highly water soluble However surprisingly ABR 215691 was found to have extremely low water solubility compared to the other metabolites as well as to the parent compound cf. Table 2.

In view of this low water solubility of ABR 215691 it may be expected that the renal excretion of ABR 215691 is low compared to that of the two other demethylation metabolites. Together the above findings indicate that CYP1A induction through ABR 215691 could eventually cause a drug to drug interaction problem in man in vivo that even if not insurmountable must nonetheless be seriously considered in medical treatment.

Therefore the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the amide N methyl deuterated ABR 215050 herein below referred to as ABR 215050 dx wherein the amide N methyl moiety was tri deuterated compared to the non deuterated parent compound were studied in rat. The reduction of the metabolic amide N demethylation when the amide N methyl was deuterium labeled was very pronounced the formation of demethylated metabolite was diminished by as much as a factor of four compared to the non deuterium labeled ABR 215050. In other words relative to ABR 215050 the in vivo formation of ABR 215691 was reduced to only 25 when ABR 215050 dx was used. It also was noted that the reduced amide N demethylation did not affect the 1 1 molar ratio for the parent drugs in vivo in plasma meaning that the positive disease remedy effects are sustained but the undesired side effect consisting of CYP1A induction is depressed. cf. herein below under In vivo investigation of pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABR 215050 and ABR 215050 dx in rat .

Further in vivo studies in rat show that CYP1A induction is substantially reduced by administration of ABR 215050 dx instead of ABR 215050 cf. herein below under In vivo investigation of CYP1A1 2 activity in rat after administration of ABR 215050 and ABR 215050 dx .

In vivo studies in mouse also show that ABR 215050 dx retains a high therapeutic activity cf. herein below under In vivo investigation of anti tumor effect of ABR 215050 dx in mouse .

Thus according to the present invention a deuterated ABR 215050 is provided which on administration gives rise to a substantially reduced CYP1A induction while providing a high therapeutic activity.

For the purpose of the present invention the term deuterium enrichment at a specific position of a compound refers to the percentage of incorporation of deuterium at that position in place of hydrogen. For example by a compound having a 90 deuterium enrichment at a given position it is intended that 90 of the molecules in a sample contain deuterium at the specified position. The natural abundance of deuterium is about 0.0156 which means that the natural deuterium enrichment at any specific position of a compound is 0.0156 . The deuterium enrichment can be determined using e.g. mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

When referring to a moiety such as a methyl group comprising several positions capable of being deuterated the term deuterium enrichment refers to a mean value based on the individual values for the positions in the moiety. As an illustrating example for a moiety having a deuterium enrichment of 90 and comprising three specific deuteration positions the deuteration enrichment at each individual position e.g. may be 85 92 and 93 or any other percentage values the mean of which is 90 .

For the purpose of the present invention disorders ameliorated by the modulation of immune function e.g. comprise malignant hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer autoimmune diseases inflammation and inflammatory diseases and hypersensitivity disorders of the immune system.

By modulation of immune function is meant e.g. mitigation or prevention of an immune response that causes undesirable effects.

For the purpose of the present invention examples of such a condition include but are not limited to melanoma carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such a condition include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial cancer or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

The mechanism for transcription of CYP1A1 involves the binding of the inducer to the Ah receptor followed by a translocation of the ligand Ah receptor complex to the nucleus where it binds to specific enhancer sequences in the 5 flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene. These sequences are referred to as xenobiotic responsive elements XREs .

A luciferase gene reporter assay was used for the measurement of AhR mediated induction of CYP1A1. Human CYP1A1 promoters and 5 flanking sequences were cloned into firefly luciferase expression vectors and stably integrated into the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 8 . The isolated cell line was renamed TV101L.

The cells were seeded in 96 well tissue culture plates 24 48 hours prior to treatment with the test compound. After the addition of ABR 215050 at a concentration of 1 10 and 100 M the cells were further incubated for 12 24 hours. The cells were harvested by the addition of lysis buffer followed by a freezing thawing cycle. An enzymatic assay was used for the determination of luciferase activity. The results expressed as the fold induction of luciferase expression are shown in Table 3 and in .

As a comparison the same assay also was performed using benz a pyrene a well known moderately strong CYP1A1 inducer. The results are shown in . The results of the in vitro assay show the extent of interaction of the tested compound with the Ah receptor which mediates induction of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2.

The same assay as used for ABR 215050 was used. The concentrations of ABR 215691 that were used and the results obtained expressed as fold induction of luciferase expression are shown in Table 4 and in .

A deuterated also referred to as deuterium enriched ABR 215050 was synthesized wherein the amide N methyl moiety was trideuterated ABR 215050 dx . This deuterated compound was diluted with non deuterated ABR 215050 to a molar ratio of 1 1. The 1 1 equivalent molar mixture was administrated to rats in an in vivo experiment. Because of additional 13 carbon labeling in the quinoline scaffold the formed amide N demethyl metabolites could be measured selectively by means of HPLC MS High performance Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometric detection . In Table 5 the plasma levels of ABR 215050 dx and ABR 215050 in nM measured in 4 different rats are shown as well as the ratio of these two compounds.

From Table 5 it appears that the 1 1 ratio of the deuterated vs. non deuterated parent compounds remain essentially unchanged in the animals for up to at least 4 hours at a peroral dosage of 2.5 mg kg.

The plasma levels of the ABR 215691 derived from ABR 215050 dx and ABR 215050 also were determined using LC MS MS and the results are shown in Table 6 which also shows the calculated ratio of the plasma levels of ABR 215691 derived from ABR 215050 dx and from ABR 215050 respectively as well as the calculated reduction of formation of amide N demethyl metabolite.

From Table 6 it appears that the formation of ABR 215691 is substantially reduced by deuteration of the amide N methyl group. The reduction of amide N demethylation obtained by said deuteration ranges from 70.5 to 75.8 over 4 hours following peroral dosage. The results are illustrated in .

In Vivo Investigation of CYP1A1 2 Activity in Rat After Administration of ABR 215050 and ABR 215050 dx

The in vivo induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 after repeated administration of ABR 215050 and of ABR 215050 dx respectively was studied in rat.

Test preparations B and C and blank preparation A were made as follows For preparation B ABR 215050 was dissolved in NaOH and sterile water at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL. The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 8.5. Preparation C was made in the same way using ABR 215050 dx. Preparation A was a blank containing only water. The preparations were stored in a refrigerator for a maximum of one week before use. Table 7 summarizes preparation data.

On arrival at the laboratory the test animals were 9 weeks old Sprague Dawley male rats having a body weight of 250 g. They were divided into 3 groups and were allowed to acclimatize for at least 7 days before the test. During the whole acclimatization and test period the animals received water and feed Labfor R70 form Kimstad Sweden ad libitum and were kept under a 12 hours dark 12 hours light cycle at a temperature of 20 2 C. and a relative humidity of 50 15 .

Before administration of any test preparation the body weight of each animal was measured and the individual dose to be administered to an animal was determined based on the weight of the animal. Administration was performed perorally during 4 days cf. Table 8.

Shortly before the final dose administration a blood sample was taken from vena saphena of rat No. 5. At the end of the administration period on day 4 blood samples were taken in heparinized tubes in order to analyze the plasma levels of the administered compounds and amide N demethylated metabolite. The samples were withdrawn from vena saphena approx. 250 L of blood and from vena cava maximum volume possible according to the schedule indicated in Table 9.

The samples were cooled in ice water and centrifuged at 1300 g 4 C. for 10 minutes as soon as possible after withdrawal within 30 minutes . Plasma was collected frozen and kept at 70 C. until analysis.

At 24 h after administration of the final dose the animals were weighed and from each animal a final blood sample was withdrawn for a pharmacokinetic analysis. The animals then were euthanized and from each one the liver was withdrawn weighed and immediately frozen in crushed dry ice. The livers then were stored at 70 C. until preparation of microsomes.

Microsomes were prepared according to the method M 0287 Preparation of subcellular fractions from animal tissues and then kept at 70 C. until analysis.

The total protein concentration of the microsomal fraction was determined according to the method M 0289 Determination of Protein according to Hartree .

The CYP1A1 2 enzyme activity was determined by incubation of the microsomal fraction with methoxyresorufin MROD and ethoxyresorufin EROD as CYP substrates according to the method M 0272A whereby EROD shows a higher specificity for CYP1A1 while MROD shows a higher specificity for CYP1A2.

According to the data represented in Table 10 the observed mean fold induction of CYP1A1 by ABR 215050 was 42 while ABR 215050 dx gave a mean fold induction of 11.5 which corresponds to a 73 reduction of the fold induction 42 11.5 42 100 of CYP1A1. Table 11 also shows that ABR 215050 gave a mean fold induction of CYP1A2 of 17 while that obtained by administration of ABR 215050 dx was 5.5 i.e. a reduction of the fold induction of CYP1A2 of 68 17 5.5 17 100 . The results are illustrated in .

The castration resistant subline LNCaP 19 was previously established from LNCaP cells 12 . Cells were maintained as previously described 13 . The LNCaP 19 cells were between passage 10 and 23 when used in the experiments. Passage 1 is defined as the first passage in our laboratory. The cells were tested and found free from mycoplasma.

Male athymic Nude BALB c mice age 8 weeks were purchased from Taconic Lille Skensved Denmark . For subcutaneous implantation one million tumor cells suspended in 200 l Matrigel BD Bioscience Bedford Mass. were inoculated on the flank of the mice. The tumor size was measured by a caliper once a week throughout the experiment and the tumor take was 75 in the untreated control group n 12 . In the tumor growth experiment ABR 215050 dx 10 mg kg day was administered via drinking water from day 7. To assure appropriate dose was given with no significant fluctuations water consumption was monitored for each animal cage during the entire experiment. It has previously been shown that the plasma half life of tasquinimod is 3.4 hours and that administration of 1 10 mg kg day via drinking water results in steady state plasma levels 0.4 1 M 14 . Animals were sacrificed when the average tumor size for the control group reached a volume of 900 100 mmor when the tumor volume for an individual animal reached 1200 mmThe results are illustrated in .
