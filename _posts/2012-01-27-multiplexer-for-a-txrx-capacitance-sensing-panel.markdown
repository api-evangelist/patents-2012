title: Multiplexer for a TX/RX capacitance sensing panel
abstract: An embodiment of a multiplexer circuit may include a plurality of Preceive (RX) channel outputs and a plurality of Qpins, where Qis greater than P. Each of a first subset and a third subset of the plurality of Qpins may be switchably coupled to at least one of the plurality of RX channels, each of a second subset of the plurality of Qpins is switchably coupled to two of the plurality of RX channels, and for each possible subset of Pcontiguous pins from the plurality of Qpins, each pin in the possible subset may be switchably coupled to a different RX channel output of the plurality of RX channel outputs.
