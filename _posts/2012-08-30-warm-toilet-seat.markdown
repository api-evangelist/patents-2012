This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 207352 filed on Sep. 22 2011 of which the contents are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a warm toilet seat suitable for forming a heat generator on a seating surface of the seat.

In conventional warm toilet seats one horseshoe shaped sheet heating element is embedded in a seating portion of a horseshoe shaped toilet seat composed of a synthetic resin see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 08 078143 and 2010 029425 . In the sheet heating element a heater cord which is coated with a fluororesin insulation and has an outer diameter of 1 mm or less is arranged in a continuous wiring pattern of connected long U shapes between one horseshoe shaped metal foil sheet such as an aluminum foil and an adhesive tape.

Particularly in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2010 029425 separated right and left seat heaters are used in one current system. Therefore a material for first and second metal foils can be effectively utilized to lower the cost and the seat heaters can be easily attached to the seating surface reliably without adhesion defects such as wrinkling and gap formation.

However the above described conventional sheet heating element having the horseshoe shaped heater unit structure is prepared by attaching the metal foil sheet to the toilet seat and then attaching the heater cord to the metal foil sheet with the adhesive tape and thereby requires high cost and complicated processes.

Furthermore though energy saving can be achieved by disposing the heating element on the seating surface of the toilet seat the heating element cannot exhibit a uniform heating distribution and cannot be transparent due to the metal foil.

In view of the problems an object of the present invention is to provide a warm toilet seat which can be produced by a reduced number of attaching step with improved productivity and reduced cost and can exhibit uniform heating distribution and excellent energy saving property.

Therefore the conventionally required steps of attaching the metal foil sheet to the toilet seat and attaching the heater cord to the metal foil sheet with the adhesive tape can be omitted and the seat heater can be disposed on the seating surface of the toilet seat in one attaching step. Furthermore since the seat heater is disposed on the seating surface of the toilet seat as compared with the case where it is disposed on the back surface of the toilet seat a time required for heating the seating surface to a predetermined temperature can be significantly reduced. In addition since the material having a heat transfer coefficient of 10 to 150 W m K is placed in the opening in the thin wiring structure the generated heat can be rapidly transferred over the entire seating surface to improve the heating distribution.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.

An embodiment of the warm toilet seat of the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that in this description a numeric range of A to B includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower and upper limit values.

First a toilet seat apparatus containing a warm toilet seat according to the embodiment will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the toilet seat apparatus has a main body a remote operation device for remotely controlling the main body a toilet seat on which a user sits a seat heater disposed on a seating surface of the toilet seat as a heat generator for warming the toilet seat and a human body detection sensor for detecting a human body. A warm toilet seat according to this embodiment contains at least the toilet seat and the seat heater disposed on the seating surface thereof. As shown in the toilet seat apparatus further has a washing device for washing an excretory of the user.

As shown in the main body contains a temperature detection sensor for detecting the temperature of the toilet seat a heater drive unit for supplying an electric power to the seat heater a seating sensor for detecting the sitting of the user on the toilet seat and a control unit for controlling the components.

For example the heater drive unit is activated to control the temperature of the toilet seat by the control unit based on a temperature information from the temperature detection sensor . When the user does not sit on the toilet seat the temperature of the toilet seat is controlled at the default temperature. When the user sits on the toilet seat the temperature of the toilet seat is changed from the default temperature to a desired temperature a preset temperature or a real time set temperature .

Four examples of the conductive films first to fourth conductive films A to D usable in the seat heater of the warm toilet seat of this embodiment will be specifically described below with reference to .

As shown in the first conductive film A has a support a thin wiring structure composed of silver formed on the support and electrodes formed on both ends. The thin wiring structure contains thin wires composed of silver and a plurality of openings surrounded by the thin wires . The arrangement pitch of the thin wires is 5000 m or less preferably 3000 m or less more preferably 1000 m or less further preferably 500 m or less . The light transmittance of the thin wiring structure is 70 or more preferably 75 or more more preferably 80 or more further preferably 83 or more . In this example the conductive layer is composed of the thin wiring structure and the electrodes .

In the first conductive film A the thin wiring structure is divided by one or more electrical insulations into a plurality of regions which each have a shape corresponding to the toilet seat . In the example of the thin wiring structure is divided by two electrical insulations into three regions and . The regions have the same or similar resistance values between the electrodes with a margin of 15 or less preferably 10 or less more preferably 8 or less further preferably 5 or less . For example the toilet seat particularly its outer periphery has a U shape and the electrical insulations have homothetic or non homothetic U shapes along the outer periphery. The shapes of the electrical insulations may be modified to achieve the same or similar resistance values with a margin of 15 or less in each of the regions . The electrical insulations may be formed simultaneously with the thin wiring structure . Alternatively the electrical insulations may be formed by laser etching or the like after the formation of the thin wiring structure . Furthermore for example the electrical insulations may be formed by cutting the first conductive film A into a plurality of pieces and by arranging the cut pieces at a distance from each other. In addition the electrical insulations may be formed by making a hole in the thin wiring structure of the first conductive film A to break the wire.

The first conductive film A is attached to the seating surface of the toilet seat with an adhesive or the like.

As shown in the second conductive film B has the support the thin wiring structure composed of silver formed on the support and the electrodes formed on both ends as in the first conductive film A. The second conductive film B further contains a heat transfer material in the openings in the thin wiring structure . The heat transfer coefficient of the thin wiring structure is 100 W m K or more more preferably 150 W m K or more further preferably 200 W m K or more the upper limit being preferably 500 W m K and the heat transfer coefficient of the heat transfer material placed in the openings is 10 to 150 W m K more preferably 30 to 120 W m K further preferably 50 to 100 W m K . The heat transfer material contains a conductive fine particle or a conductive polymer. In this example the conductive layer is composed of the thin wiring structure the electrodes and the heat transfer material . Unlike the first conductive film A the second conductive film B does not have the electrical insulations .

As shown in the third conductive film C has approximately the same structure as the first conductive film A but is different in that the electrical insulations see are not formed. The third conductive film C is inferior to the other example films in heating distribution. Therefore a resin layer such as a protective layer or coating may be formed on the surface of the support to obtain a uniform heating distribution.

As shown in the fourth conductive film D has the support and a layer composed of silver formed over the entire surface of the support . The layer contains the electrodes . In this example the conductive layer is composed of the entirely covering layer . The entirely covering layer is not transparent and therefore is not preferred from the viewpoint of appearance on the seating surface of the toilet seat . Thus the layer may be coated with a paint to improve the appearance.

In the first to fourth conductive films A to D the conductive layer may be covered with a protective layer.

Then a method for producing the warm toilet seat of the embodiment will be described below. The warm toilet seat production methods include three production methods first to third production methods shown in .

In the first production method in the step S of the conductive film the conductive layer is shaped under a load of 5 to 235 kg cm. Specifically as shown in the conductive film is molded under vacuum into a curved surface shape corresponding to the seating surface shape of the toilet seat . In this method the vacuum molding is carried out using a forming mold having approximately the same dimension as an injection mold for forming the toilet seat see . The mold shapes are exaggeratingly shown in B and . As shown in when the toilet seat has a three dimensional curved surface the forming mold has a similar curved surface an inverted curved surface in this case and a large number of vacuum vents . For example when the toilet seat has a concave curved surface the forming mold has such a dimension that a convex curved surface thereof is fitted into the concave curved surface of the toilet seat .

The vacuum molding of the conductive film may be carried out using the forming mold as follows. As shown in the conductive film is preheated at 110 C. to 300 C. Then as shown in the conductive film is pressed to the convex curved surface of the forming mold and an air pressure load of 5 to 235 kg cmis applied to the conductive film by vacuuming air through the vacuum vents in the forming mold . The conductive film having the curved surface shape corresponding to the seating surface of the toilet seat is prepared by the vacuum molding.

Then in the step S of the shaped conductive film is attached to the seating surface of the toilet seat with the adhesive or the like to produce the warm toilet seat the toilet seat equipped with the seat heater .

The second production method contains an insert molding step. In the step S of as in the step S of the first production method the conductive film the conductive layer is shaped under a load of 5 to 235 kg cm.

In the step S as shown in the shaped conductive film is placed in the injection mold . The conductive film is placed in a cavity of the injection mold such that the conductive layer or the protective layer formed thereon is brought into contact with a cavity surface for molding the seating surface of the toilet seat .

Then in the step S a molten resin is introduced into the cavity of the injection mold and is hardened to obtain the toilet seat having the seating surface integrated with the conductive film . In this case the conductive layer is formed in direct contact with the seating surface of the toilet seat or with the protective layer interposed therebetween.

The third production method contains an insert molding step as in the second production method. In the step S of unlike in the second production method the unshaped conductive film is placed in the injection mold .

Then in the step S the molten resin is introduced into the cavity of the injection mold and is hardened to obtain the toilet seat having the seating surface integrated with the conductive film . In the injection molding insert molding it is preferred that the molten resin injection pressure or the like is controlled to shape the conductive film under a load of 5 to 235 kg cm.

In the first production method the conventionally required steps of attaching the metal foil sheet to the toilet seat and attaching the heater cord to the metal foil sheet with the adhesive tape can be omitted and the conductive film the seat heater can be placed on the seating surface of the toilet seat in one attaching step.

In the second production method the toilet seat integrated with the conductive film can be obtained by the insert molding in the step of injecting the molten resin. Therefore the step of attaching the seat heater can be omitted whereby the warm toilet seat production process can be simplified.

In the third production method the step of shaping the conductive film can be omitted before the injection molding whereby the warm toilet seat production process can be simplified significantly.

In a case where the heat generator is located on the outer surface the generated heat can be removed by the resin resulting in poor efficiency. Thus a heat insulator may be interposed between the conductive film as a heat generator and the seat resin to efficiently warm the outer surface. Examples of the heat insulators include fiber insulations such as glass wools rock wools sheep wools cellulose fibers and carbonized corks and foam insulations such as urethane foams polystyrene foams EPS bead method polystyrene or expanded polystyrene and foamed rubbers FEF flexible elastomeric foam . The heat insulator may be a PET foam or the like having a moldability similar to that of a PET used for the conductive film .

The support in the conductive film may be a plastic film or plate etc. Examples of materials for the plastic films and plates include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates PET and polyethylene naphthalates PEN polyolefins such as polyethylenes PE polypropylenes PP polystyrenes and EVA vinyl resins such as polyvinyl chlorides and polyvinylidene chlorides polyether ether ketones PEEK polysulfones PSF polyether sulfones PES polycarbonates PC polyamides polyimides acrylic resins and triacetyl celluloses TAC . In a case where the conductive film is required to have a transparency the total visible light transmittance thereof is preferably 70 to 100 more preferably 85 to 100 further preferably 90 to 100 . In this case the support is preferably composed of the PET PC or acrylic resin. The PET is particularly preferred also from the viewpoint of workability. The support may be colored depending on the intended use.

The plastic film or plate may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers.

To strongly attach the conductive layer to the support the support is preferably subjected beforehand to a surface activation treatment such as a chemical treatment a mechanical treatment a corona discharge treatment a flame treatment an ultraviolet treatment a high frequency treatment a glow discharge treatment an active plasma treatment a laser treatment a mixed acid treatment or an ozone oxidation treatment.

For example in a case where a silver halide emulsion layer formed on the support is exposed and developed to form a metallic silver portion of the conductive layer as described hereinafter the adhesion close contact between the support and the conductive layer may be ensured by 1 subjecting the support to the surface activation treatment and then forming the silver halide emulsion layer directly on the surface or 2 subjecting the support to the surface activation treatment forming an undercoat layer on the surface and forming the silver halide emulsion layer on the undercoat layer. Particularly the method of 2 can further improve the close contact between the support and the conductive layer .

The undercoat layer may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. The undercoat layer may contain a copolymer derived from a monomer selected from vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride butadiene methacrylic acid acrylic acid itaconic acid maleic anhydride and the like and may contain a polyethylenimine an epoxy resin a grafted gelatin a nitrocellulose or a gelatin. The undercoat layer preferably contains a gelatin. The undercoat layer may further contain resorcin or p chlorophenol as a compound for swelling the support . If the undercoat layer contains the gelatin the undercoat layer may further contain as a gelatin hardener a chromium salt such as a chromium alum an aldehyde such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde an isocyanate an active halogen compound such as 2 4 dichloro 6 hydroxy S triazine an epichlorohydrin resin an active vinyl sulfone compound etc. In addition the undercoat layer may contain as a matting agent SiO TiO an inorganic fine particle or a fine polymethyl methacrylate copolymer particle.

As described above the conductive film contains the support and the conductive layer formed thereon. The conductive layer may be formed on one or both sides of the support . The conductive layer may be formed by disposing a silver salt emulsion layer containing a silver halide and a binder on the support and by exposing and developing the emulsion layer in a desired pattern. As one example of the pattern the conductive layer having the thin wiring structure can be formed by exposing and developing the emulsion layer in a mesh pattern with a large number of lattice intersections of the thin wires so that the light transmittance of the conductive layer can be improved. Alternatively the conductive layer may be formed by exposing and developing the entire surface of the emulsion layer.

The silver salt emulsion layer may contain a solvent and an additive such as a dye in addition to the silver halide and the binder. One two or more emulsion layers may be formed on the support . The thickness of the emulsion layer is preferably 0.05 to 20 m more preferably 0.1 to 10 m.

The silver salt emulsion layer contains the silver halide as the silver salt. The silver halide has an excellent light sensing property and thus preferably used in this embodiment. Silver halide technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be utilized in the embodiment.

The silver halide may contain a halogen element of chlorine bromine iodine or fluorine and may contain a combination of the elements. For example the silver halide preferably contains AgCl AgBr or AgI as a main component. Also silver chlorobromide silver iodochlorobromide or silver iodobromide is preferably used as the main component. The term the silver halide contains AgBr as the main component means that the molar fraction of bromide ion is 50 or more in the silver halide composition. The silver halide particle containing AgBr as the main component may contain iodide or chloride ion in addition to the bromide ion. The silver halide containing a silver halide other than AgBr such as AgCl or AgI as the main component is interpreted in the same manner.

The amount of the silver halide in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited. The amount in the silver density in terms of silver is preferably 0.1 to 40 g m more preferably 0.5 to 25 g m further preferably 3 to 25 g m still further preferably 5 to 20 g m particularly preferably 7 to 15 g m.

The binder is used in the silver salt emulsion layer to uniformly disperse the silver halide particles and to help the emulsion layer adhere to the support . The binder may contain a water insoluble or water soluble polymer and preferably contains a water soluble polymer. Specific examples of the binders include gelatins polyvinyl alcohols PVA polyvinyl pyrolidones PVP polysaccharides such as starches celluloses and derivatives thereof polyethylene oxides polysaccharides polyvinylamines chitosans polylysines polyacrylic acids polyalginic acids polyhyaluronic acids and carboxycelluloses.

The amount of the binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and is appropriately controlled in view of achieving satisfactory dispersion and adhesion properties. The silver Ag binder volume ratio of the emulsion layer is preferably 1 1 to 4 1 more preferably 1.5 1 to 4 1. When the silver binder volume ratio of the emulsion layer is within the above range the breakage of the metallic silver portion can be more reliably prevented after the molding.

The solvent used for forming the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and examples thereof include water organic solvents e.g. alcohols such as methanol ketones such as acetone amides such as formamide sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide esters such as ethyl acetate ethers ionic liquids and mixtures thereof.

The mass ratio of the solvent to the total 100 parts by mass of the other components in the silver salt emulsion layer is 30 to 90 parts by mass preferably 50 to 80 parts by mass.

The silver salt emulsion layer may contain an acrylic latex to improve the contact with the support . The acrylic latex may be a dispersion containing an aqueous medium and a polymer derived from at least one acrylic monomer selected from methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate ethyl methacrylate methyl methacrylate acetoxyethyl acrylate and the like.

The latex gelatin mass ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 0.15 1 to 2.0 1 more preferably 0.5 1 to 1.0 1.

The silver salt emulsion layer may further contain various additives. Examples of the additives include thickeners antioxidants matting agents lubricants antistatics nucleation accelerators spectral sensitizing dyes surfactants antifoggants film hardeners and black pepper inhibitors.

In the conductive film the protective layer may be formed on the conductive layer . The conductive layer can be further prevented from peeling from the conductive film by forming the protective layer. The protective layer preferably contains a gelatin a high molecular polymer or the like. The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.02 to 0.2 m more preferably 0.05 to 0.1 m. The protective layer may be formed directly on the conductive layer and may be formed on an undercoat layer on the conductive layer .

In the above described second conductive film B the heat transfer material is placed in the openings in the thin wiring structure . If the silver salt emulsion layer contains the heat transfer material or if a layer containing the heat transfer material is applied or printed on the emulsion layer the heat transfer material can be placed in the openings in the thin wiring structure by exposing and developing the emulsion layer. The layer containing the heat transfer material preferably contains a conductive fine particle and a binder. The layer containing the heat transfer material may be composed of the conductive fine particle and the binder. The mass ratio of the conductive fine particle to the binder the conductive fine particle binder mass ratio is preferably 1 33 to 5.0 1 more preferably 1 3 to 3.0 1.

The layer containing the heat transfer material may be uniformly formed and attached by a coating or printing process. A coater such as a slide coater a slot die coater a curtain coater a roll coater a bar coater or a gravure coater a screen printer or the like may be used in the coating or printing process.

Examples of the components for the conductive fine particle include metal oxides such as SnO ZnO TiO AlO InO MgO BaO and MoO and composite oxides thereof. Another atom may be added to the metal oxide. The metal oxide is preferably SnO ZnO TiO AlO InO or MgO particularly SnO. The SnOis preferably doped with antimony particularly preferably doped with 0.2 to 2.0 mol of antimony. The shape of the conductive fine particle is not particularly limited and may be a grain shape a needle shape etc. When the conductive fine particle has a spherical shape the average particle diameter is preferably 0.085 to 0.12 m. When the conductive fine particle has a needle shape the average long axis length is preferably 0.2 to 20 m and the average short axis length is preferably 0.01 to 0.02 m.

In the case of using the conductive fine particle and the binder the application amount of the conductive fine particle is preferably 0.05 to 10 g m more preferably 0.1 to 5 g m further preferably 0.1 to 2.0 g m.

If the application amount of the conductive fine particle is more than the above upper limit the layer cannot have practically sufficient transparency and cannot be suitably used in the film required to be transparent. Furthermore when the application amount is more than the above upper limit the conductive fine particle cannot be easily dispersed uniformly in the application so that the resultant layer often has increased production defects. On the other hand when the application amount is less than the lower limit the layer tends to have an insufficient in plane heat generation property.

In the layer containing the conductive fine particle for the heat transfer material the binder is additionally used to bring the conductive fine particle into close contact with the support . The binder is preferably a water soluble polymer. The binder may be selected from the above binder examples for the emulsion layer.

In the case of using the heat transfer material the heat transfer material may contain a conductive polymer and an insulating polymer. For example the layer containing the heat transfer material may be composed of the conductive polymer and the insulating polymer. In this case a first layer containing the conductive polymer and a second layer containing the insulating polymer as a main component may be stacked. The layer containing the heat transfer material may contain a mixture of the conductive polymer and the insulating polymer. In such a structure the amount of an expensive conductive polymer can be reduced thereby reducing the price of the product. In the case of using the mixture of the conductive polymer and the insulating polymer the conductive polymer may be blended with another binder at a conductive polymer binder ratio of 10 90 conductive polymer other binder . The conductive polymer content is preferably 50 or more more preferably 70 or more further preferably 80 or more by mass.

If the mixture of the conductive polymer and the insulating polymer is used in the layer containing the heat transfer material the conductive polymer may be uniformly distributed or spatially nonuniformly distributed. In the nonuniform distribution it is preferred that the conductive polymer content is increased in the outer surface of the layer. If the first layer containing the conductive polymer as the main component and the second layer containing the insulating polymer as the main component are stacked it is preferred that the second layer is thicker than the first layer from the viewpoint of price reduction.

The conductive polymer is preferably high in light transmittance and conductivity and preferred examples thereof include electron conductive polymers such as polythiophenes polypyrroles and polyanilines.

The electron conductive polymer may be a polymer known in the art such as a polyacetylene a polypyrrole a polyaniline or a polythiophene. The electron conductive polymer is described in detail in for example ed. P. Bernier S. Lefrant and G. Bidan Elsevier 1999 Kluwer 1993 P. Chandrasekhar Kluwer 1999 and Ed. Walwa Vol. 1 4 Marcel Dekker Inc. 1997 . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that also novel electron conductive polymers to be developed in future can be used in the present invention. The electron conductive polymer may be used singly or as a blend of a plurality of the polymers.

The insulating polymer may be an acrylic resin an ester resin a urethane resin a vinyl resin a polyvinyl alcohol a polyvinyl pyrrolidone a gelatin etc and is preferably an acrylic resin or a polyurethane resin particularly an acrylic resin.

The conductive film may be prepared by exposing and developing the silver salt emulsion layer on the support in a desired pattern to form the conductive layer containing the metallic silver portion with a desired shape.

If the thin wiring structure is formed on the support it is preferred that a mesh lattice pattern of straight lines crossed approximately perpendicularly or a mesh lattice pattern of wavy lines with at least one curve between the intersections in the conductive portion is formed by the exposure and development treatments. In a case where the conductive layer has a mesh patterned metallic silver portion the pitch of the mesh pattern the total of the line width of the metallic silver portion and the width of the opening is not particularly limited and is preferably 5000 m or less.

The silver salt emulsion layer may be exposed in a pattern by a surface exposure method using a photomask or a scanning exposure method using a laser beam. In the methods a refractive exposure process using a lens or a reflective exposure process using a reflecting mirror may be used and various exposure treatments such as contact exposure proximity exposure reduced projection exposure and reflective projection exposure treatments may be carried out.

The silver salt emulsion layer is subjected to the development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention.

In this embodiment by the exposure and development treatments the conductive portion the metallic silver portion is formed in the exposed area and the opening the light transmitting portion is formed in the unexposed area. The process of developing the emulsion layer may include a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed area to stabilize the layer. Fixation treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used for the emulsion layer in the present invention.

A portion to be converted to the electrical insulation in the conductive layer of the conductive film may be irradiated with a laser light to selectively remove the metal from the portion. It is particularly important to appropriately select the laser wavelength used in the irradiation. If the laser wavelength is 400 nm or more preferably 500 nm or more the conductive layer can be etched without damaging the support . The laser light emitted to the conductive layer may be a YAG laser a carbon dioxide laser etc. The emission of the laser light to the conductive layer may be carried out using a laser irradiation apparatus having a computerized XY direction scanning mechanism. In this case for example the electrical insulation may be formed in the conductive layer by inputting a preset information on the pattern of the electrical insulation into a computer memory via off line teaching reading the pattern information from the memory at the start of driving the laser irradiation apparatus and irradiating the conductive layer with the laser light while controlling the scanning mechanism based on the read information.

In a case where the electrical insulation is formed by this laser etching the conductive layer preferably has a thickness of 5 m or less. If the thickness is excessively large the output of the laser light has to be increased for the etching whereby the support may be damaged by the laser light.

The resistance of the heat generator may be controlled by printing or applying a conductive paste or by attaching a metal foil tape on a high resistance portion. A feeder for applying a voltage is needed to generate heat. The feeder may be formed by printing or applying a conductive paste such as a silver paste or by attaching a metal foil tape. It is preferred that the surface resistance R of the feeding electrode the electrode and the surface resistance R of the heat generator surface satisfy R R 5 or more.

The production of the conductive film may be appropriately combined with technologies described in the following patent publications and international patent pamphlets shown in Tables 1 and 2. The terms Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. Pamphlet No. etc. are omitted.

In this embodiment as described above the conductive film is shaped under a particular condition into a desired shape to obtain the final conductive film used as the seat heater . The shaped conductive film may have a two dimensional shape a flat plate shape or a three dimensional shape a convexo concave or curved surface shape . The conductive film having the two dimensional shape may be prepared by stretching elongating the unshaped conductive film having the flat plate shape under particular temperature and load conditions in the direction parallel to the film surface. The conductive film having the three dimensional shape may be prepared by forming the unshaped conductive film having the flat plate shape under particular temperature and load conditions into a shape of a curved surface a cuboid a button a cylinder a combination thereof etc.

The unshaped conductive film may be formed into the two dimensional shape under the particular temperature and load conditions by stretch forming vacuum forming pressure forming hot press forming etc. A forming apparatus such as a universal material testing instrument TENSILON manufactured by A D Co. Ltd. may be used in this process.

The unshaped conductive film may be formed into the three dimensional shape under the particular temperature and load conditions by vacuum forming pressure forming hot press forming etc. A forming apparatus such as an ultra compact vacuum forming machine FVS 500 manufactured by Wakisaka Engineering Co. Ltd. may be used in this process.

In the production method of this embodiment the unshaped conductive film is shaped at a temperature of 110 C. to 300 C. The temperature is preferably 120 C. to 280 C. more preferably 130 C. to 250 C. further preferably 140 C. to 240 C. particularly preferably 150 C. to 220 C. Thus the forming temperature of the conductive film is preferably higher than a commonly used resin forming temperature. If the temperature is excessively low the conductive film is not sufficiently softened the desired shape is hardly obtained and the conductivity is often deteriorated in the forming step. On the other hand if the temperature is excessively high the conductive film is disadvantageously melted. The temperature is a preset temperature of a forming apparatus i.e. an atmospheric temperature in the forming step.

In the production method of this embodiment the conductive film is shaped under a load of 5 to 235 kg cm. The load is preferably 10 to 150 kg cm more preferably 15 to 50 kg cm. Thus the forming load of the conductive film is preferably larger than a commonly used resin forming load. If the load is excessively small it is difficult to form the conductive film into the desired shape. On the other hand if the load is excessively large the film and the conductive layer may be broken.

The load means a weight applied per a unit area of the conductive film in the shaping step. Thus in the stretch forming of the conductive film the load is a tensile strength applied to the unit area of a cross section perpendicular to the tensile direction of the conductive film . In the vacuum forming the load is a pressure applied to the unit area of the conductive film under vacuum. In the pressure forming the load is an air pressure applied to the unit area of the conductive film .

In the production method of this embodiment in the shaping step the unshaped conductive film may be stretched preferably to 110 or more more preferably to 115 or more further preferably 130 or more to prepare the final conductive film . When the shaping is carried out under the above temperature and load conditions the conductive film can be stretched to 110 or more while preventing the breakage of the metallic silver portion. In general the metallic silver portion in the conductive layer may be broken if the conductive film is stretched to 110 or more. In contrast under the above temperature and load conditions the metallic silver portion in the conductive layer is hardly broken even if the conductive film is stretched to 110 or more. Thus by performing the shaping step under the above temperature and load conditions the flexibly of forming the conductive film can be improved to expand the shape design possibility of the conductive film as compared with conventional processes.

The upper limit of the stretch ratio of the conductive film is not particularly limited. If the conductive film is stretched at a stretch ratio of 250 or less preferably 200 or less the breakage of the metallic silver portion in the conductive layer can be prevented more reliably.

The term the conductive film is stretched to 110 or more stretched at a stretch ratio of 110 or more means that the conductive film is stretched at the highest stretch ratio in a particular direction the shortest length of the line extending in the particular direction along the surface of the stretched conductive film connecting both ends of the surface is 110 or more while the shortest length of the line extending in the corresponding direction along the surface of the unshaped conductive film connecting both ends of the surface is 100 .

In the production method of this embodiment the stretch speed in the shaping step is preferably 1000 mm min or less more preferably 50 to 1000 mm min further preferably 50 to 300 mm min. The stretch speed means the speed of stretching the surface of the conductive film in the particular direction in which the conductive film is stretched at the highest stretch ratio . If the stretch speed is excessively high the metallic silver portion in the conductive layer is easily broken. If the stretch speed is excessively low it is difficult to shape the conductive film into a desired shape and the productivity is deteriorated.

In the production method of this embodiment the stretch ratio Y and the shaping temperature X C. in the shaping step preferably satisfy the following inequality I 0.00810.4286 in which X is 80 to 230.

If the conductive film is shaped under the condition of the inequality I the breakage of the conductive layer can be further prevented.

The stretch ratio Y and the shaping speed Z mm min in the shaping step preferably satisfy the following inequality II 0.00062.3494 in which Z is 50 to 1000.

If the conductive film is shaped under the condition of the inequality II the breakage of the conductive layer can be further prevented.

In the production method of this embodiment the shaping step is preferably carried out in an atmosphere having a relative humidity of 70 or more. The relative humidity is more preferably 80 to 95 . If the conductive film is shaped under such a relative humidity the binder of the water soluble polymer such as a gelatin is swelled whereby the conductive film can be easily stretched.

In this embodiment the surface resistivity R ohm sq of the conductive film before stretched and the surface resistivity R ohm sq of the conductive film after stretched preferably satisfy the relation of R R

The surface resistivity R is preferably 50 ohm sq or less more preferably 0.01 to 50 ohm sq further preferably 0.1 to 30 ohm sq particularly preferably 0.1 to 10 ohm sq.

In this embodiment a vapor treatment a calender treatment and a xenon irradiation treatment are preferably carried out to improve the conductivity and formability.

The metallic silver portion may be irradiated with a pulsed light from a xenon flash lamp after the development treatment. The irradiance level per one pulse is preferably 1 to 1500 J more preferably 100 to 1000 J further preferably 500 to 800 J. The irradiance level can be measured using a common ultraviolet intensity meter. The ultraviolet intensity meter may have a detection peak within a range of 300 to 400 nm.

Examples of the lights to be emitted to the metallic silver portion include ultraviolet electron beam X ray gamma ray and infrared radiations. The ultraviolet is preferred from the viewpoint of versatility. A light source for the ultraviolet irradiation is not particularly limited and examples thereof include high pressure mercury lamps metal halide lamps and flash lamps such as xenon flash lamps . In this embodiment the xenon flash lamp is preferred from the viewpoints of the versatility and the improvement in the conductivity and formability of the metallic silver portion. For example the xenon flash lamp is available from Ushio Inc.

The pulsed light irradiation is preferably performed 1 to 50 times more preferably performed 1 to 30 times.

The xenon irradiation treatment is carried out under a relative humidity of 5 or more in a hygrothermal atmosphere while controlling the humidity to prevent dew condensation. The reason for the improvement in the conductivity and formability is unclear. It is believed that the micromovement of at least part of the water soluble binder is facilitated under the increased humidity whereby bindings between the particles of the metal the conductive material are increased.

The relative humidity in the hygrothermal atmosphere is preferably 5 to 100 more preferably 40 to 100 further preferably 60 to 100 particularly preferably 80 to 100 .

The metallic silver portion may be subjected to a smoothing treatment after the development treatment. In the smoothing treatment the bindings between the metal particles are increased in the metallic silver portion whereby the conductivity and formability of the portion is significantly improved.

For example the smoothing treatment may be carried out using a calender roll generally a pair of rolls. The smoothing treatment using the calender roll is hereinafter referred to as the calender treatment.

The roll used in the calender treatment may be a metal roll or a plastic roll such as an epoxy polyimide polyamide or polyimide amide roll. Particularly in a case where the silver salt emulsion layer is formed on both sides it is preferably treated with a pair of the metal rolls. In a case where the silver salt emulsion layer is formed only on one side it may be treated with a combination of the metal roll and the plastic roll in view of preventing wrinkling. The lower limit of the line pressure is preferably 1960 N cm 200 kgf cm or more more preferably 2940 N cm 300 kgf cm or more. The upper limit of the line pressure is preferably 6860 N cm 700 kgf cm or less. The line pressure load means a force applied per 1 cm of the film to be calender treated.

The temperature at which the smoothing treatment such as the calender treatment using the calender roll is carried out is preferably 10 C. without temperature control to 100 C. Though the preferred temperature range depends on the density and shape of the mesh or wiring metal pattern the type of the binder etc. the temperature is more preferably 10 C. without temperature control to 50 C. in general.

After the meshed silver layer composed of the developed silver the thin wiring structure is formed on the support it is preferred that the conductive element precursor is dipped in a warm or heated water in a hot water treatment or brought into contact with a water vapor in a vapor treatment. By the treatment the conductivity and formability can be easily improved in a short time. It is considered that the water soluble binder is partially removed in the treatment whereby the bindings between particles of the developed silver the conductive material are increased.

The treatment may be carried out after the development treatment and is preferably carried out after the smoothing treatment.

The temperature of the hot water used in the hot water treatment is preferably 60 C. to 100 C. more preferably 80 C. to 100 C. The temperature of the water vapor used in the vapor treatment is preferably 100 C. to 140 C. at 1 atm. The treatment time of the hot water or vapor treatment depends on the type of the water soluble binder used. If the support has a size of 60 cm 1 m the time is preferably about 10 seconds to 5 minutes more preferably about 1 to 5 minutes.

In Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 to 4 the temperature rise time the resistance value between electrodes the power consumption the heating distribution and the number of attaching steps were measured. In Examples 1 to 4 also the light transmittance was measured.

The potassium hexachloroiridate III 0.005 KCl 20 aqueous solution and the ammonium hexachlororhodate 0.001 NaCl 20 aqueous solution in Liquid 3 were prepared by dissolving a complex powder in a 20 aqueous solution of KCl or NaCl and by heating the resultant solution at 40 C. for 120 minutes each.

Liquid 1 was maintained at 38 C. and pH 4.5 and 90 of Liquids 2 and 3 were simultaneously added to Liquid 1 over 20 minutes under stirring to form 0.16 m nuclear particles. Then Liquids 4 and 5 described below were added thereto over 8 minutes and residual 10 of Liquids 2 and 3 were added over 2 minutes so that the nuclear particles were grown to 0.21 m. Further 0.15 g of potassium iodide was added and the resulting mixture was ripened for 5 minutes whereby the particle formation was completed.

The resultant was water washed by a common flocculation method. Specifically the temperature was lowered to 35 C. the pH was lowered by sulfuric acid until the silver halide was precipitated within a pH range of 3.6 0.2 and about 3 L of the supernatant solution was removed first water washing . Further 3 L of a distilled water was added thereto sulfuric acid was added until the silver halide was precipitated and 3 L of the supernatant solution was removed again second water washing . The procedure of the second water washing was repeated once more third water washing whereby the water washing and demineralization process was completed. After the water washing and demineralization process the obtained emulsion was controlled at a pH of 6.4 and a pAg of 7.5. To this were added 100 mg of a stabilizer of 1 3 3a 7 tetraazaindene and 100 mg of an antiseptic agent of PROXEL trade name available from ICI Co. Ltd. to obtain a final emulsion of cubic silver iodochlorobromide particles. The cubic particles contained 70 mol of silver chloride and 0.08 mol of silver iodide and had an average particle diameter of 0.22 m and a variation coefficient of 9 . The final emulsion had a pH of 6.4 pAg of 7.5 conductivity of 4000 S cm density of 1.4 10kg m and viscosity of 20 mPa s.

8.0 10mol mol Ag of the following compound Cpd 1 and 1.2 10mol mol Ag of 1 3 3a 7 tetraazaindene were added to the emulsion and the resultant was well mixed. Then the following compound Cpd 2 was added to the mixture to control the swelling ratio if necessary and the pH of the coating liquid was controlled to 5.6 using citric acid.

A 100 m thick PET film having a rectangular shape as viewed from above was used as the support . Both surfaces of the support were hydrophilized by a corona discharge treatment.

The above emulsion layer coating liquid was applied to the above corona discharge treated PET film such that the Ag amount was 7.8 g mand the gelatin amount was 1.0 g m.

In the obtained photosensitive film the emulsion layer had a silver binder volume ratio silver GEL ratio vol of 1 1.

The above photosensitive film was exposed to a parallel light from a light source of a high pressure mercury lamp using a photomask having a lattice patterned space photomasking line space 290 m 10 m pitch 300 m . The photomask was capable of forming a patterned developed silver image line space 10 m 290 m . Also an exposure for forming the electrodes was carried out in this step. Thus a band like area with a predetermined width on one side was exposed. Then the exposed film was subjected to a treatment including fixation water washing and drying.

A conductive film having a conductive layer was produced in this manner. The conductive layer contained a thin wiring structure formed in a mesh pattern and a metal portion formed on the one side without openings . The conductive layer had a thickness of 0.2 m and contained thin wires having a line width of 10 m and a pitch of 300 m. In addition the conductive film had a surface resistance value of 25 ohm sq.

The conductive film was cut into a U shape corresponding to the shape of a toilet seat shown in to produce a sample A. The metal portion was left at both ends of the U shape as the electrode for applying a voltage.

The conductive layer of the sample A was laser etched to form two U shaped electrical insulations as shown in whereby the thin wiring structure was divided into three regions and to produce a sample B. The regions and had the same or similar resistance values with a margin of 15 or less. In the laser etching a laser light was emitted such that the spot diameter was 10 m.

In the above exposure treatment the photosensitive film was exposed using a mask having a pattern including the shapes of the mesh and the electrical insulations . Then the photosensitive film was developed and the resultant conductive film was cut into the U shape to produce a sample C. The sample C had the same structure as the above sample B see .

Liquid 6 was applied to the upper side of the above silver halide emulsion layer at 30 ml mto form a conductive fine particle layer a layer containing the heat transfer material .

The photosensitive film was exposed and developed in the same manner as the sample A and then cut into the U shape to produce a sample D see . The gelatin had an intrinsic heat transfer coefficient of 0.2 W m K and the tin oxide had an intrinsic heat transfer coefficient of 80 W m K.

A product of Comparative Example 1 was produced by attaching a conventional sample containing a nichrome wire and an aluminum foil in combination to a surface opposite to a seating surface a back surface of a toilet seat in a conventional manner.

The samples A B C and D were each stretched to 110 and formed on the forming mold into a shape corresponding to the toilet seat by a vacuum pressure molding under a load of 80 kg cm. Then products of Examples 1 2 3 and 4 were produced by attaching each molded conductive film to the seating surface of the toilet seat with the adhesive OCA Optical Clear Adhesive .

In Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 to 4 the resistance value between the electrodes was measured.

In Examples 1 to 4 the light transmittance of the conductive film having the thin wiring structure was measured.

In Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 to 4 an alternating voltage was applied from the electrodes to the conductive film at the room temperature of 25 C. so that the conductive film was heated. The voltage was controlled such that the conductive film was heated to the same temperature as Comparative Example 1. Then the heating distribution the temperature rise time and the power consumption were measured. The temperature rise time means the time required for rising the surface temperature to a predetermined temperature which was 14 C. in this example. The heating distribution was taken by Thermovision CPA 7000 manufactured by Chino Corporation when the surface temperature was risen to the predetermined temperature. The temperature was measured by Thermometer CT 30 manufactured by Chino Corporation. The power consumption was measured by Power Hitester 3332 manufactured by Hioki E.E. Corporation.

As shown in Table 3 the interelectrode resistances of Examples 1 to 4 were lower than that of Comparative Example 1. The temperature rise times of Examples 1 to 4 were significantly shorter than that of Comparative Example 1 since the conductive film was attached to the seating surface of the toilet seat . The product of Example 1 exhibited the temperature rise time of 130 seconds and both the products of Examples 2 and 3 exhibited the temperature rise time of 120 seconds. The product of Example 4 which contained the heat transfer material in the opening exhibited the temperature rise time of 100 seconds shorter than those of Examples 2 and 3. The light transmittances of Examples 1 to 4 were 80 or more and thus the films of Examples 1 to 4 were transparent though only the product of Example 4 exhibited a slightly lowered transmittance because of the heat transfer material contained in the opening of the thin wiring structure . The power consumptions were approximately equal in Examples 1 to 4 as well as Comparative Example 1. The heating distributions were approximately uniform in Examples 2 and 3 using the electrical insulations and Example 4 using the heat transfer material in the opening though the product of Example 1 exhibited a nonuniform distribution.

It is clear from the results of Examples 2 and 3 that the advantageous effect of the electrical insulations was such that the regions and had approximately the same resistance values approximately the same current values and thus approximately the same heat generation amounts. It is believed that the temperature rise times were shortened and the heating distributions were improved by forming the electrical insulations .

It is clear from the results of Example 4 that the advantageous effect of the heat transfer material was such that the conductive fine particles the tin oxide in Example 4 contained in the opening acted to improve the heat transfer because of its heat conductivity higher than that of gelatin. It is believed that the temperature rise time was shorter than those of Examples 2 and 3 and the heating distribution was improved by using the heat transfer material .

The pitch of the thin wires in the above sample C was changed to evaluate the variation of the heating distribution.

In the conductive film of the sample C the pitch of the thin wires was controlled to 5000 1000 or 300 m. Each conductive film was stretched to 115 and formed on the forming mold into a shape corresponding to the toilet seat by a vacuum pressure molding under a load of 80 kg cm. Then products of Examples 11 12 and 13 were produced by attaching each molded conductive film to the seating surface of the toilet seat with the adhesive OCA . It should be noted that the pitch of Example 13 was equal to that of Example 3.

The heating distribution was taken by Thermovision CPA 7000 manufactured by Chino Corporation and evaluated in the same manner as First Example. The evaluation results are shown in Table 4.

As shown in Table 4 as long as the pitch of the thin wires was 5000 m or less the heating distributions were excellent and not deteriorated.

In Comparative Examples 11 and 12 and Examples 21 to 25 the heat transfer rate of a layer containing a heat transfer material was evaluated. Specifically the heat transfer coefficient of a mixture of conductive fine particles silver particles and a binder gelatin was changed and the heat transfer rate relative to that of silver and the light transmittance were measured.

The silver had an intrinsic heat transfer coefficient of 240 W m K and the binder gelatin had an intrinsic heat transfer coefficient of 0.2 W m K. The volume of the heat transfer material containing layer was considered as 1 the volume ratios of the conductive fine particles and the binder in the layer were calculated and the heat transfer coefficient of the mixture in the layer was obtained based on the volume ratios by proportional calculation. Then the transfer rate of the silver was considered as 10 according to Fourier s law and the transfer rates relative ratios of Comparative Examples 11 and 12 and Examples 21 to 25 were calculated. In addition also the light transmittances of Comparative Examples 11 and 12 and Examples 21 to 25 were measured. Incidentally the transfer rate of the gelatin was 1 1000 or less of that of the silver.

As shown in Table 5 the product of Comparative Example 11 had the low transfer rate of 0.2 10 though it had the high light transmittance of 85 . The product of Comparative Example 12 had the low light transmittance of 65 and poor transparency due to a large amount of the conductive fine particles though it had the high transfer rate of 8 10.

In contrast the products of Examples 21 to 25 had the light transmittances of 80 or more to exhibit excellent transparencies and further had the excellent high transfer rates of 1 10 to 7 10.

Thus it was preferred that the mixture in the heat transfer material containing layer had a heat transfer coefficient of 10 to 150 W m K.

In samples 1 to 7 whether the conductive film could be stretched or not at a desired stretch ratio under a load in the shaping step was evaluated.

The unshaped conductive film used in the above production of the sample A was cut into a size of 30 mm 100 mm placed in a universal material testing instrument TENSILON RTF manufactured by A D Co. Ltd. and tensile stretched in the long axis direction under conditions shown in Table 6. The stretch ratio was obtained by measuring the mesh pitch of the metallic silver portion with a microscope. The stretch property was evaluated by observing whether the conductive film and the conductive layer could be stretched or not at the desired stretch ratio.

As shown in Table 6 the conductive film could be stretched at the desired stretch ratio under a load of 5 kg cmor more.

In samples 8 to 36 the relation between the satisfaction of the inequality I or II and the breakage of the thin wires the metallic silver portion was evaluated in the step of shaping the conductive film .

The unshaped conductive film used in the above production of the sample A was cut into a size of 30 mm 100 mm placed in a universal material testing instrument TENSILON RTF manufactured by A D Co. Ltd. and tensile stretched in the long axis direction under conditions shown in Tables 7 and 8.

The surface resistivities R and R were measured at 25 C. and a relative humidity of 45 using LORESTA GP manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech Co. Ltd.

Also the satisfaction of the following inequalities I and II was evaluated. In Tables 7 and 8 each sample were evaluated as Satisfactory when it satisfied the inequality I or II and evaluated as Unsatisfactory when it did not satisfy the inequality I or II . 0.00810.4286 I 0.00062.3494 II 

The evaluation results are shown in Tables 7 and 8. The stretch speed shaping temperature load and stretch ratio of each of the samples 8 to 36 are shown in Table 7 and the satisfaction of the inequality I the satisfaction of the inequality II the breakage of the metallic silver portion and the R R ratio of each of the samples 8 to 36 are shown in Table 8.

It is clear from the results of Tables 7 and 8 that the conductive films having the desired shapes and the low surface resistivities could be produced by the production method of the embodiment. In addition the breakage of the metallic silver portion was reduced under the condition of one of the above inequalities I and II and the breakage was not caused under the conditions of both the inequalities I and II . It should be noted that the close contact between the conductive layer and the support was maintained in each shaped conductive film .

It is to be understood that the warm toilet seat of the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment and various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
