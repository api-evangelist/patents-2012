This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 624 371 filed on Nov. 23 2009 and entitled INCENTIVIZED ADOPTION OF TIME DEPENDENT INSURANCE BENEFITS which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 118 400 filed on Nov. 26 2008 and entitled INSURANCE OPTIMIZER AND REAL TIME ANALYTICS. This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 624 366 entitled MONETIZATION OF PERFORMANCE INFORMATION OF AN INSURED VEHICLE and filed on Nov. 23 2009. The entireties of the above captioned applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates generally to insurance benefits and optimization thereof and more specifically to promoting adoption of time dependent customized insurance benefit s .

Insurance benefit s or coverage typically refers to a contract wherein an insurance carrier agrees to pay for insured financial losses resulting from a specified event. Such insurance benefit s is a commodity that many people purchase for peace of mind or because local laws require such coverage. Thus most people might consider insurance as something that is necessary and at times undesirable due to insurance premiums.

Rates of insurance benefit s such as car insurance rates are typically determined based on desired benefit s and various factors related to the prospective beneficiary that are mostly historical and rather limited. In general the insurance company determines insurance costs based on insurance models that classify segments of the population in groups sharing similar data such as data on features of beneficiary e.g. health condition s or property intended to be insured car make and model car color car features whether the car is garaged estimated miles to from the office etc. demographic data e.g. age group sex marital status educational background ethnicity historical data related to intended insurance benefit which can include driving history as recorded primarily based on an event basis accident s ticket s for traffic violation processed claim s etc. environmental factors related to where the prospective beneficiary lives which is commonly factored in through ZIP code and available information thereof recorded appraised value of property crime rate in the area and so forth. Members of a segment are not distinguished for assessment of insurability and related cost. While such approach has the advantage of simplicity it fails to incorporate variance s that exist amongst members in same segment and hence squanders valuable data related to each individual s unique traits that can further affect respective insurance benefit s rates. More importantly in some cases the segments upon which rates are determined do not adequately represent a prospective beneficiary s potential coverage liability. As an example with respect to motor vehicle insurance and for a specific segment a first operator of a car may commute to work using inner city streets while a second operator of a second car can commute through a highway.

In addition many insurance consumers do not associate any loyalty with a particular insurance carrier particularly those such as motor vehicle insurers which commercialize highly commoditized insurance benefits. Thus to find better coverage lower rates or both a large number of insurance consumers frequently evaluate alternative providers of insurance benefit s with respect to the provider currently supplying the insurance benefit s . As a result insurance providers or insurance carriers aggressively pursue service and benefit s differentiation regardless how marginal in order to mitigate prevalent consumer attrition.

Moreover most insurance benefit s such as motor vehicle insurance coverage provided by conventional insurance carriers is typically rigidly priced and billed in relatively long time scales e.g. in monthly or semi annually periods. Rates occasionally fluctuate but commonly fluctuations only occur at the end of such relatively long time scales and can be based on additional factors unrelated directly to features or characteristics of the beneficiary e.g. an automobile owner. Accordingly adjustment to insurance benefit s and pricing thereof can significantly fail to timely accommodate changes to beneficiary s needs or be supplied at a fair price point.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed examples. This summary is not an extensive overview and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In accordance with one or more examples and corresponding disclosure thereof various aspects are described in connection with optimizing insurance from the perspective of both the insurance provider and the insurance purchaser. According to an aspect real time analytics is utilized to selectively adjust insurance premiums coverage and other parameters.

One or more embodiments provide system s and method s to incentivize adoption of time dependent customized insurance benefit s . A provider of insurance benefit s incentivizes adoption of the insurance benefit s in exchange for knowledge of operation characteristics of an insured entity. Incentivation is accomplished at least in part through generation of incentive offer s based on available knowledge. Knowledge is associated with an operator of the insured entity rather than with such entity and the operator can regulate the scope of exchanged knowledge and received incentive offer s and related content. Knowledge is cumulative and collected from insured entity and environment in which the entity operates. Incentive offer s can be directed to provision of insurance benefit coverage that is adequate to current or nearly current operation condition s discounted real time or nearly real time insurance benefits or subsidized service s . Offered incentives can be afforded at least in part through monetization of available knowledge via commercialization thereof or targeted advertisement.

In addition the one or more embodiments or additional or alternative embodiment s provide system s and method s to monetize knowledge of operation characteristics of an insured entity are provided. The provider of insurance benefit s supplies knowledge of operation characteristics of an insured entity in exchange for a financial compensation. Financial compensation also can be received through commercialization of resources to expose an agent e.g. an operator an occupant a resident etc. linked to the insured entity to advertisement in addition to delivery of the knowledge of operation characteristics of the insured entity. The provider of insurance benefit s can exploit the financial compensation to afford at least in part incentives directed to discounted insurance benefit s or subsidized service s .

While various aspects features or advantages of the subject innovation are illustrated with insurance of a motor vehicle such as an automobile a motor boat an airplane a motorcycle or the like and real time or nearly real time coverage it should be appreciated that disclosed aspects features or advantages are not so limited and can be exploited in provision of most any or any insurance benefit s . As an example insurance benefit s can include health insurance coverage in which case performance information comprises vitals biometrics or other physiological data or metrics of an individual as well as data on environment in which the individual lives or works. As another example the insurance benefit s can encompass home insurance coverage wherein performance information can include data on whether the house doors are locked when no one is present or property vandalism events affect location of insured house etc.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends one or more examples comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the various aspects may be employed. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings and the disclosed examples are intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.

Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that the various aspects may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing these aspects.

As used in this application the terms component module system platform interface and the like are intended to refer to a computer related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities wherein the computer related entity and the entity related to the operational apparatus can be either hardware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution. One or more of such entities are also referred to as functional elements. As an example a component may be but is not limited to being a process running on a processor a processor an object an executable a thread of execution a program and or a computer. By way of illustration both an application running on a server or network controller and the server or network controller can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers. Also these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets e.g. data from one component interacting with another component in a local system distributed system and or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal . As another example a component can be an apparatus with specific functionality provided by mechanical parts operated by electric or electronic circuitry which is operated by a software or firmware application executed by a processor wherein the processor can be internal or external to the apparatus and executes at least a part of the software or firmware application. As yet another example a component can be an apparatus that provides specific functionality through electronic components without mechanical parts the electronic components can include a processor therein to execute software or firmware that provides at least in part the functionality of the electronic components. As further yet another example interface s can include input output I O components as well as associated processor application or Application Programming Interface API components. While the foregoing examples are directed to aspects of a component the exemplified aspects or features also apply to a system platform module interface and the like.

Artificial intelligence based systems e.g. explicitly and or implicitly trained classifiers can be employed in connection with performing inference and or probabilistic determinations and or statistical based determinations as in accordance with one or more aspects as described hereinafter. As used herein the term inference refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system environment and or user from a set of observations as captured through events sensors and or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action or can generate a probability distribution over states for example. The inference can be probabilistic that is the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events and or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification schemes and or systems e.g. support vector machines neural networks expert systems Bayesian belief networks fuzzy logic data fusion engines . . . can be employed in connection with performing automatic and or inferred action in connection with the disclosed aspects.

Various aspects will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of components modules and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional components modules etc. and or may not include all of the components modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used. The various aspects disclosed herein can be performed on electrical devices including devices that utilize touch screen display technologies and or mouse and keyboard type interfaces. Examples of such devices include computers desktop and mobile smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs and other electronic devices both wired and wireless.

Additionally in the subject disclosure the word exemplary is used to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather use of the word exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion.

Further the term set as employed herein excludes the empty set. Thus a set in the subject disclosure includes one or more elements or entities. As an illustration a set of offers includes one or more offers or a set of devices includes K devices with K a natural number greater than or equal to unity.

As described in greater detail below the subject disclosure provides system s and method s to incentivize adoption of real time or nearly real time customized insurance benefit s . A provider of insurance benefit s incentivizes adoption of the insurance benefit s in exchange for knowledge of or information on operation characteristics of an insured entity. Knowledge is cumulative and can be collected from the insured entity or an environment in which the entity operates performance collection components can probe operation conditions and environment of the insured entity. Incentivation can be accomplished at least in part through generation of incentive offer s based on available knowledge and exposure of such offer s to an operator of the insured entity. Knowledge is associated e.g. in a one to one relationship with the operator of the insured entity rather than with the entity itself accordingly incentive offer s can be customized for the operator irrespective of details e.g. vehicle make or model of the insured entity. The operator can regulate the volume and detail of knowledge or information exchanged with the provider of insurance benefit s likewise the operator can specify the scope e.g. type and desired features of received incentive offer s and related content such as advertisement. Incentive offer s can be directed to provision of insurance benefit coverage that is adequate to current or nearly current operation condition s discounted real time or nearly real time insurance benefits or iii subsidized service s .

In addition the subject disclosure provides system s and method s to monetize knowledge of operation characteristics of an insured entity are provided. The provider of insurance benefit s supplies knowledge of operation characteristics of an insured entity in exchange for a financial compensation. Financial compensation also can be received through commercialization of resources to expose an agent e.g. an operator an occupant a resident etc. linked to the insured entity to advertisement in addition to delivery of the knowledge of operation characteristics of the insured entity. The provider of insurance benefit s can exploit the financial compensation to afford at least in part incentives directed to discounted insurance benefit s or subsidized service s .

In aspects described herein operational performance of a vehicle utilized as part of time dependent insurance benefit s not only can reward a safe operator with discounted insurance benefit s rates but it can incentivize the safe operator to maintain a time dependent insurance benefit policy. Operational performance as exploited herein provides real time or nearly real time data on performance or operation of a vehicle and the environment on which the vehicle performs and can be utilized in conjunction with other information to evaluate driving behavior and assess in real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s costs and establish incentives related to such insurance benefit s .

Referring to the drawings is a high level representation of a system that promotes adoption of real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s in accordance with aspects of the subject disclosure. As indicated supra the real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s includes insurance for vehicle however the real time benefit s can include other benefits such as health insurance life insurance or the like related to operator s or occupant s of vehicle . Such real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s are provided e.g. offered marketed issued administered or effected by service provider platform .

To promote adoption of real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s vehicle or a device linked thereto supplies service provider platform with information on performance or operation of vehicle and in response incentive offer s is received. Information and incentive offer s can be exchanged through a communication framework which can include various communication networks mobile and non mobile and associated functional elements e.g. component s server s access point s . . . that enable communication communication networks can include personal network s e.g. point to point short range telecommunication network based on for example wearable devices local area network s or wide area network s . Service provider platform or related third party network s can issue incentive offer s based at least in part on available information which can be current or nearly current information or historical information. Service network platform is functionally connected to third party network s via interface which can include I O interface components e.g. modem s gateway s router s server s . . . wired or wireless links or the like.

Information can correspond to performance information of vehicle at an instantaneous position R t which is a time dependent position vector and indicates a trajectory of vehicle and after a period of operation t t t with t a current or substantially current instant and ta time at which vehicle operation started. In addition information can include cumulative performance data or historical performance data. Performance data can be collected by vehicle or a device functionally coupled thereto and can include data intrinsic to vehicle or data extrinsic to vehicle . Intrinsic data can comprise location e.g. latitude longitude altitude velocity acceleration or deceleration e.g. driven by actuation of brake s of vehicle or operational condition s e.g. mileage maintenance and repair records of vehicle . In the alternative extrinsic data includes data on operator or occupant s of vehicle or data on operation environment . As an example the operation environment can be a highway in which vehicle travels and the extrinsic data can include position of surrounding in road or off road vehicles relative to vehicle velocity or acceleration of surrounding vehicles traffic data average velocity of a group of cars presence of accident s etc. at nearby location s that is part of a planned trajectory of vehicle identified road hazards intended destination or departure location R t or the like. As another example operation environment can include location s in which vehicle operates e.g. high or low accident area high car damage or theft area safe garage parking area . . . . Moreover with respect to operator of vehicle extrinsic data can include biometrics information or vitals data of such operator e.g. heart rate blood pressure blood glucose perspiration level etc. which can affect performance of vehicle . For example when vehicle is a car irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure can suggest the driver of vehicle is highly stressed and thus prone to unsafe driving conduct which may warrant increase insurance benefit s rate. For another example an operator with dangerously low blood glucose can be likely to cause an accident in view of risk of loosing consciousness due to inadequate blood sugar level thus an increase in insurance benefits s may be warranted.

It can be appreciated that information conveys rich highly segmented contextual data e.g. data on several facets of operation of vehicle or operator or occupant s thereof that service provider platform or related third party network s can exploit to generate incentive offer s . Thus in contrast to conventional incentivation systems incentive offer s described herein are highly customized beneficiary centric offer s . In addition incentive offer s can be adjusted in real time or nearly real time in response to time dependent variations in information . Furthermore in view that incentive offer s are exchanged for information such incentive offer s can provide value to both service provider platform and prospective beneficiary of retained insurance benefits.

In an aspect of the subject disclosure incentive offer s can be directed to provision of i insurance benefit s or coverage that is adequate to current or nearly current operation condition s of vehicle in addition to specific incentive package s ii discounted real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s for vehicle iii subsidized service s that operator of vehicle or occupant s thereof can consume or iv enhanced incentive package s particularly in scenarios in which service provider platform increases price point or rate of insurance benefit s in view of received information . In connection with i if operator of vehicle adopts real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s the operator not only benefits from received specific incentive package s e.g. coupons for merchandise related to trajectory of vehicle but in view of pattern s of operation of vehicle as revealed by information the operator also mitigates risk of underinsured operation of vehicle or unnecessary acquisition of insurance benefit s e.g. excessive comprehensive coverage . Thus incentive offer s directed primarily to provision of adequate coverage can increase customer loyalty through generation of highly customized dynamic insurance benefit s .

With respect to ii service provider platform or one or more of third party network s can subsidize discounts for insurance benefit s that operator of vehicle can acquire. Magnitude of discounts can be assessed based at least in part on at least one of volume and detail of information that is communicated to service provider platform scope of incentive offer s allowed to be received or scope of recipients of information . In an aspect higher detail or granularity and or higher scope can result in higher discounts. In the alternative or in addition higher granularity can result in forgiveness of specific information within information that can be typically adverse to beneficiary e.g. operator of vehicle and can result in increase of rate of insurance benefit s for instance an operator that discloses received tickets for traffic violation s e.g. camera captured speeding infraction can avoid increase in insurance benefit rate if the unlawful speed was within a predetermined threshold e.g. 2 4 miles per hour of a speed limit in the area in which the camera captured the traffic violation. Such threshold or other forgiveness criteria can be established by service provider platform e.g. insurance company based on normal or expected conduct of operation of vehicle .

In another aspect with respect to incentive offer s allowed to be received discounts for insurance benefit s can be determined by type and volume of advertisement that operator of vehicle agrees to receive from service provider platform or third party network s . In such an aspect service provider platform can subsidize insurance benefit s through revenue originated from sale or lease of resources e.g. radio channel s or radio time slot s display real estate in navigation device for advertisement within vehicle . Specific departments of service provider platform retailers third party network s can purchase or lease such advertisement resources. In addition or as an alternative discounted price point for insurance benefit s can be achieved if operator of vehicle accepts an incentive offer to receive customized or contextual promotional content from the service provider platform or specific advertiser s . Such promotional content can be customized based at least in part on a portion of information that is made available to the service provider platform or the specific advertiser. Based on the portion of information customization can be accomplished as a function of at least one of time location or event s . As an example the portion of information that is made available can include typical mobility trajectories of vehicle such information can be provided to retailers restaurants bookstores coffee shops etc. located in the vicinity of the mobility trajectories e.g. a route of vehicle from a starting point to a destination a retailer within such retailers can deliver advertisement s or incentives e.g. coupons at times in which vehicle is in proximity of the retailer location. As another example if the portion of information that is supplied includes common destinations e.g. historically re incident locations of vehicle retailers can advertise specific merchandise related to the destination. In particular if the common destinations are for example a childcare facility a coffee shop and a health club retailers that sale diapers baby formula children clothing custom coffee blends and espresso machines and nutrition supplements can supply advertisement to vehicle or related operator. As yet another example if the available portion of information includes specific mechanical condition s of vehicle and position coupon s and contact information e.g. telephone number email address website address of a nearby repair shop and towing service can be delivered to vehicle in an emergency event. It should be appreciated that as the portion of information that is allowed to be made available to advertiser s becomes more comprehensive such information allows improved customization or targeting of advertisement content s and thus discount in price point of insurance benefit s can become substantial e.g. 50 discount over regularly quoted price point as the advertiser s can pay premium fees for advertisement opportunities.

In yet another aspect operator e.g. driver or vehicle can elect to allow or block specific information from service provider platform e.g. insurance company or other entities such as law enforcement agencies e.g. third party network s . Based on such election scope of information can be determined and service provider e.g. insurance company can provide lower or higher rate s for insurance benefit s in one example allowing broad information to be conveyed as part of information may result in lower rates.

With respect to iii if an operator of vehicle allows exposure of information that allows rich context identification e.g. extraction of patterns of mobility and operation habits related to vehicle an advertiser or service provider exposed to such information can subsidize one or more services for the operator. The service can include wireless service such as voice data or voice and data road assistance medical or dental services e.g. if the dentist office is in proximity of workplace of operator dentist can provide discounted service salon or barber service etc.

Regarding iv as indicated supra in scenarios in which granularity or scope of information can adversely affect assessed rate for insurance benefit s service provider platform can promote adoption of real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s through enhanced incentive package s such as discounted operation e.g. driving educational material s or operation lesson s . It should be appreciated that access to such material can benefit both operator of vehicle and service provider platform e.g. insurance company since safer operation of vehicle reduces risk of operator pursuing a claim as a result of accident which reduces expenses for service provider platform and operator of vehicle improves performance and thus can reduce rate of insurance benefit s over time.

In an aspect vehicle can deliver traffic or user data and control data or signaling to access point s AP s via wireless link likewise vehicle can receive traffic and signaling from AP s via wireless link . In view of mobility e.g. trajectory R t of vehicle as time progresses different access point s in AP s can serve traffic and signaling to vehicle . Signaling and traffic can be delivered or received in accordance with one or more radio technology protocols such as Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS 3GPPP High Speed Packet Access HSPA or fourth generation 4G radio technologies such as LTE Advanced LTE A . A network interface not shown with wireless functionality and related circuitry e.g. antenna s modem codec s etc. in vehicle can enable such exchange of traffic and signal amongst vehicle and AP s . Traffic and signaling received in AP s can be relayed to one or more network management component s e.g. radio network controller RNC mobility management entity MME network gateway s . . . within WAN which can deliver at least a portion of the traffic and signaling to a gateway GTY which functionally connects WAN to service network via link s . Link s can include wired link s e.g. reference link s or wireless or wired backhaul pipe s . As described supra service network platform is functionally connected to third party network s via interface . Service network platform or third party network s can deliver traffic and signaling to vehicle through the functional element s described supra. Third party network s can route traffic or signaling through service provider platform or direct connectivity to link s via interface wired or wireless link s reference link s router s gateway s etc. .

Performance collection component s can be integrated with the vehicle e.g. for which performance operation information or knowledge is collected. For example performance collection component s can be embodied in a computerized monitoring box integrated with the vehicle and that probes mechanical condition s thereof tire pressure oil or fuel level battery charge fluid s temperature payload weight etc. or operation parameters such as velocity and acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. For another example an integrated navigation system e.g. a satellite based navigation unit and associated electronic circuitry or integrated cameras e.g. for vehicle assisted maneuvering also can provide at least a portion of performance operation information. For yet another example at least one or more performance collection component s can be embodied as sensors integrated in the steering wheel or other control device e.g. a joystick in an aircraft of vehicle . Such sensors can efficiently allow collection of biological or medical data of operator of vehicle without reliance on for example wearable devices which may not be readily adopted by older drivers or operators.

Additionally or alternatively performance collection component s can be part of an add on device and associated circuitry operationally coupled e.g. attached through a functionally active wired or wireless link and suitable interface s to the vehicle. As an example one or more of performance collection component s can be embodied in a mobile station smartphone wireless enable personal computer which can supply at least one of location data or trajectory data such as velocity and acceleration or deceleration. In an aspect such data can be collected through a global navigation satellite system Global Positioning System GPS Galileo etc. transceiver and processor that operates in the mobile station. As another example data can be collected through an add on navigation device and associated circuitry.

One or more components in performance collection component s can enable identification of an operator of a vehicle. For example a biometric reader an iris scan fingerprint reader etc. can identify the operator and associate in a one to one relationship collected data on performance or operation of the vehicle with the operator. As another example if one of collection component s is embodied in a mobile handset a vehicle that includes wireless communication functionality e.g. point to point short range wireless access point s or other types of vehicular access point s can identify the operator of the vehicle or other occupant s after the mobile handset attaches to an access point deployed in the vehicle. Accordingly collected performance data can be independent of operated vehicle.

Performance data also can associated with an operator in vehicles that lack biometric readers or limited wireless functionality. In a scenario a device and associated circuitry that can identify the operator can be carried by the operator. For example a radiofrequency RF transceiver device attached to a keyfob can be actuated by an RF scanner affixed to the vehicle and thus provide identification for the operator. For another example a tag with a barcode associated with the vehicle or one or more performance collection component s can be scanned prior to operation of vehicle. Other identification means are also possible.

In addition or in the alternative to features or aspects of performance collection component s in one or more embodiments performance collection component s can generally include at least one of a processor a memory one or more components or circuitry for communication amongst the one or more components the processor and the memory in order to implement collection of performance data. For specific embodiments the one or more components that can be part of performance collection component s can be retained within the memory as set s of code instructions that are executed by the processor to enable at the very least collection and delivery of performance data as described herein. Execution of such code instructions also can enable exchange of at least performance data with other functional elements in example system .

In an aspect intrinsic and extrinsic data on performance or operation can be conveyed to a set of operator machine interface s which can include conventional vehicular dashboard panels or advanced windshield display s and to an election component that can administer or manipulate such data and regulate access thereto in accordance with an election of incentive offer s . In another aspect intrinsic or extrinsic data on performance or operation can be collected in accordance with collection logic which can establish at least in part at least one of scope of collected data or data that is to be conveyed to operator machine interface s or election component .

Information management component receives data on performance or operation and generates performance record s which can be at least one of 1 instantaneous record s that convey performance as probed at a current or nearly current instant or 2 aggregated record s over a predetermined performance period. In an aspect with respect to 1 instantaneous record s can replicate received data e.g. instantaneous record s can comprise raw operation data. In another aspect with respect to 1 and 2 information management component can receive performance data in format s native to performance collection component s and format generated performance record s in accordance to a protocol suitable for communication via access network . Generated performance record s can be specific to an operator of the vehicle for which the performance data is gathered performance record s can be retained in memory within memory element classified according to operator as illustrated by memory element s which can comprise one or more databases. In one or more embodiments such as embodiment illustrated in information management component can include a mining component that generates performance record s in accordance with 1 or 2 . In an aspect as part of aggregation of received performance data mining component can compute statistics e.g. mean standard deviation and other momenta etc. extract patterns identify data clusters extract correlations etc.

In addition information management component can select a portion of performance record s for a specific operator as recorded in memory element s and deliver the selected portion to service provider platform as operation information e.g. . The selected portion of record s can be part of conveyed record s . In an aspect selection of performance record s can proceed in accordance with privacy criteria which comprises a configurable set of rules that control volume and detail level e.g. instantaneous record s aggregated record s of performance information e.g. record s that is delivered to at least one of service provider platform or third party network s . The set of rules can be configured by the operator of a vehicle e.g. for which the data on performance is collected. In an embodiment election component e.g. through information management component in combination with operator machine interface s can enable configuration of privacy criteria or associated set of rules. It is noted that while privacy criteria is illustrated as separate from collection logic such criteria can be retained within collection logic . As an illustration in embodiment selection component enables configuration of privacy criteria. As illustrated in example embodiment components that are part of information management component can exchange information e.g. data or signaling via a bus or any other information exchange conduit protocol. Bus can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus or a message bus.

In response to supplied performance information e.g. record s service provider platform can generate and deliver incentive offers s to election component . In an aspect access component can receive the performance information or information on operation and retain such information in record storage thus the record storage can include current or historical data on performance or operation of a vehicle or other insured entity associated with record s . In addition access component also can receive signaling . As described supra service provider platform e.g. insurance carrier can generate the incentive offer s based at least in part on the received performance information in an aspect benefit generation component can produce the incentive offer s . In one or more embodiments for example embodiment illustrated in benefit generation component can include an analysis component that can process received performance record s to issue an incentive offer to at least that end benefit generation component can exploit a set of code instructions retained in application store . Exchange of information e.g. data or signaling amongst components that are part of benefit generation component and amongst one or more of such components and memory can be effected via a bus or any other information exchange conduit protocol. Bus can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus or a message bus.

In an aspect analysis component can correlate performance data with information available on the environment in which vehicle operates. In an example data on vehicle s velocity and location can be correlated e.g. compared with speed limits for a road currently traveled to determine if the vehicle is speeding and thus establish a current or nearly current insurance benefit rate or a discount thereof. In another example analysis performance can contrast data on mechanical performance with standardized or expected parameters for various parts of the vehicle in particular its make model etc. to establish operational safety or assess risk of malfunction and thus determine a current or nearly current insurance benefit rate or discount thereof. In yet another example analysis component can retrieve information related to operational environment of vehicle from one or more of third party network s for instance analysis component can retrieve statistics on accident occurrence or criminality indices along a current or selected route. In another aspect analysis component can aggregate received performance record s which can be retained in record storage which is substantially the same memory element as record storage to compose incentive offer s e.g. establish a real time or nearly real time insurance benefit rate or discount thereof or determine promotional content s e.g. content s to incentivize operator of vehicle . As part of aggregation of received performance data analysis component can compute statistics e.g. mean standard deviation and other momenta etc. extract patterns identify data clusters etc. Empirical customary rule s of operation of vehicle e.g. the norm of operation can be applied to aggregated data to determine magnitude of changes e.g. increment or decrement in insurance benefit s rates. Consideration of norm of operation rather than lawful operation of vehicle can result in unchanged insurance benefit rates or unchanged incentive offer s in case a fine for a traffic law violation is assessed to an operator of vehicle and the operator pays such fine if the violation occurred while operator complied with the norm of operation. As an illustration an operator driving at 67 MPH in a 65 MPH zone may be complying with the norm and thus service provider may not consider such offense detrimental to insurance cost s or prospective incentive offer s .

Upon or after generation of incentive offer s service provider platform e.g. through benefit generation component can deliver incentive offer s via access network s NTWK s which can be embodied in the example communication framework illustrated in and can comprise internet infrastructure e.g. broadband remote access server s B RAS s digital subscriber line access multiplexer DSLAM . . . and related connectivity. Election management component via information management component for example can receive incentive offer s and relay such offer s or content s thereof to a benefit display component which is part of at least one of operator machine interface s . In an aspect information e.g. data such as record s incentive offer s content s or signaling can be exchanged amongst election component and access network s and access network s and service provider platform via respectively interfaces and . Each of such interfaces and can include at least one of I O interface components e.g. modem s gateway s router s server s . . . wired or wireless links or the like. Access network s also can exchange information e.g. data advertisement signaling record s incentive offer s signaling . . . via interface which can include at least one of I O interface components e.g. modem s gateway s router s server s . . . wired or wireless links or the like.

Benefit display component can render the received incentive offer s or content s thereof and can collect input from at least one of operator or occupant s of the vehicle that hosts election component . In an aspect such input can be received through one or more gestures such as speech e.g. voice commands touch e.g. screen tap motion e.g. hovering over screen displacement of benefit display component or the like. As illustrated benefit display component can be integrated in an operator machine interface however in one or more embodiments benefit display component can be a dedicated component or integrated within election component or one of performance collection component s .

Received operator s input can be a specific election or an indication thereof of one or more of the received incentive offer s or content s thereof. In an aspect the specific election can include an indication of at least one of scope of supplied performance records or scope and source of content received as part of an elected incentive offer such indication customizes incentive offer s from the perspective of the operator of vehicle . Source can include service provider platform or third party network s . In an example feature information management component can commit within privacy criteria the indication of content s and scope and source s thereof authorized to be received as part of the elected incentive offer. The specific election can be conveyed to election component which can relay the election to service provide platform via access network s as part of signaling . After an election to accept an incentive offer and related insurance benefit plan or content s the election can be revoked at substantially any or any time. Benefit display component also can render content s associated with an elected incentive offer.

Based on the operator s input which can be received by service provider platform e.g. via access component as part of signaling benefit generation component can effect term s of a particular election of incentive offer s . For instance benefit generation component can update an insurance benefit policy to reflect discount s or increased or decreased coverage and associated revised insurance benefit rate s bill a beneficiary in accordance with updated policy issue incentive s and related content such as advertisement or other promotional material s educational material s coupon s service credit s . In addition as part of effecting the term s of elected incentive offer s benefit generation component configure one or more of third party network s to direct such network s to produce at least one of a portion of incentive s e.g. coupon s service credit or advertisement s associated with the particular election of incentive offer s . Moreover benefit generation component can convey a directive to information management component to supply at least a portion of performance information e.g. record s to specific third part network s . In an example embodiment e.g. issuance component can configure the one or more third party network s or can convey such a directive to information management component . In the alternative or in addition benefit generation component can authenticate predetermined third party network s with information management component in order for such predetermined third party network s to access at least a portion of performance record s . In one or more embodiments e.g. anti fraud component can implement such authentication in accordance for example with one or more conventional authentication mechanisms.

With respect to further aspects of example system information management component can administer rendering of incentive s or related content s e.g. received in accordance with terms of an accepted incentive offer. In an aspect information management component can compute a safety metric for a current or substantially current operation condition of vehicle and determine based at least in part on predefined safety threshold s for example a suitable operation condition to render at least one of incentive s or related content s . In an aspect computation of the safety metric indicated supra can include data on operation of the vehicle and one or more safety factors which can be gleaned from the performance data. Computation can be based on disparate levels of intelligence ranging from utilization of predetermined functions that model safety metrics to autonomous determination of a safety metric. In the latter correlations amongst available current substantially current historical etc. intrinsic and extrinsic data on performance or operation can be extracted based on AI methodologies and a safety level or metric can be inferred from the extracted knowledge.

Format or packaging of the at least one of incentive offer s or related content s can be dictated at least in part by the suitable operation condition in order to supply sufficient information to convey commercial aspect s and not distract operator e.g. driver of vehicle excessively. Accordingly in an aspect the packaging can include a persistence time interval to render content s . As an example content s related to an accepted incentive offer can be rendered to an operator of a car when the car is stopped at a red traffic light a condition that can be determined through data collected by camera s and speedometer reading s such data and reading s captured for example by one or more of performance collection component s . The rendered content s can be adjusted to a typical time interval that a red traffic light remains actuated. As another example content s such as a set of rich advertisement can be rendered when the vehicle that hosts election component is parked but while the operator is still occupying the vehicle. Based on parking location information management component can customize the rendered advertisement If the vehicle is parked near a retailer for which advertisement is available as part of an accepted incentive offer the rendered advertisement can be linked to merchandise offered for sale at the retailer. Such customization is part of targeted advertisement provided by aspects of the subject disclosure. In one or more embodiments of information management component e.g. example embodiment delivery component can format or package received incentive offer s and content s associated with an elected incentive offer as described supra. In further embodiment s packing component within benefit generation component can format or package content s e.g. associated with incentive offers as described supra. Delivery component also can process input received from an operator of vehicle via benefit display component and can compute safety metrics hereinbefore. In an aspect delivery component can tailor incentive offer s or related content in accordance at least in part with available rendering resources or medium e.g. display screen in a mobile handset or a head up display in vehicle . For a head up display delivery component can control projection of the incentive offer s or related content such as advertisement wherein benefit display component embodies at least in part the head up display. To minimize distraction caused by rendered incentive offer s or related content s e.g. advertisement delivery component can exploit various elemental indicia such as light sources that span a spectrum of wavelengths e.g. green red yellow . . . to convey available discount for insurance benefit s in an incentive offer a coupon value or available promotional material from a specific retailer or service provider. For example blue light can indicate promotional material from insurance carrier whereas green light can convey advertisement from a food retailer. In an embodiment light sources can be part of benefit display component and can be embodied in light emitting diodes LEDs .

Moreover information management component also can select portion s of generated record s and retain such portion s in sampling storage in order to preserve snapshot s of historical data on operation that can be utilized to leverage historical performance in a determination of one or more real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s or incentive offer s related therewith. For example performance records of different longevity retained in sampling storage can be correlated to determine if specific aspects of operation of vehicle such as observance of posted speed limits is a persistent feature along historical records of operation or if it is a singular performance aspect directed to eliciting incentive offer s with associated low insurance benefit s rates. In one or more embodiments e.g. example embodiment anti fraud component can download e.g. request and retrieve upon acknowledgement of the request historical performance record s retained in sampling storage and determined whether a current nearly current or recent performance is fraudulent and geared towards obtainment of artificially low rates for insurance benefit s . Anti fraud component also can establish legitimacy of received performance record s . Anti fraud component can exploit one or more software or firmware applications retained as one or more sets of code instructions in application store to make determinations on fraud.

In example system election component also can include information regulation component which can control access to performance record s e.g. control of asynchronous delivery of record s delivery of record s based on schedule delivery or disclosure of record s in response to a request delivery of record s as part of a service. Control can be dictated at least in part by a configurable set of regulation rules stored in memory element configuration of such regulation rules can be implemented in a manner similar to configuration of privacy criteria an operator of vehicle that hosts at least a portion of example system can configure the set of regulation rules. The set of regulation rules enforces access privileges that can be granted to service provider platform or third party network s . Additionally information regulation component can control content such as incentive package s or advertisement s associated with elected incentivized time dependent e.g. real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s .

In an aspect of the subject disclosure content of memory can be transferred amongst vehicles. In a scenario if a dedicated device and associated components and circuitry embodies performance collection component s election component and operator machine interface s the device can be removed from a first vehicle e.g. family car and functionally fitted in a second vehicle e.g. a rental car the fitting can be enabled by an interface such as a Universal Serial Bus USB port and associated connector s . Thus available performance record s and other information can be exploited during operation of the second vehicle e.g. a rental car . In another scenario memory can be a removable memory card and so the knowledge stored therein can be realized in a vehicle through functional fitting of the memory card in such scenario election component and components therein can be retained within the memory card as a set of computer or device executable code instructions. In yet another scenario content of memory can be uploaded to a mobile device through a suitable interface e.g. USB port and connector s infra red IR interface and downloaded to a disparate vehicle from the mobile device.

In example system described supra collection of performance information and generation of incentive offer s is effected in disparate functional environments. In an alternative or additional example system that enables incentivation of adoption of real time or nearly real time insurance benefit s both collection of data on performance or operation and generation of incentive offer s can be conducted within a single functional environment e.g. on board the operated vehicle e.g. for which data is collected. is a block diagram of such an example system .

In example system benefit generation component is local to the vehicle for which performance information is generated. To generate incentive offer s as described supra benefit generation component exploits generation criteria and methodologies or algorithms retained in application store within memory . Terms of accepted incentive offer s can be communicated via access network s to at least one of service provider platform or third party network s in order to effect such terms e.g. update an insurance benefit policy to reflect discount s or increased coverage and associated revised insurance benefit rate s bill beneficiary in accordance with updated policy issue content such as advertisement or other promotional material s educational material s coupon s service credit s in accordance with accepted incentive offer s .

Generation of incentive offer s on board of an operated vehicle can reduce signaling over access network s and thus improve real time or nearly real time aspects of incentive offer s . In addition efficiencies related to election of incentive offer s can be realized in areas with unreliable or unavailable communication service through access network s . In an illustrative scenario generation of incentive offer s can proceed even when access network s experiences outage due to poor radio link quality network congestion or malfunctioning of a main cellular tower or other type of access point e.g. a metropolitan Wi Fi AP. In such scenario accepted term s of incentive offer s can be logically retained in memory and conveyed to at least one of service provider platform or third party network s upon or subsequent to communication service recovery.

Monetization of information on operation of the insured vehicle or any other insurance entity is advantageous to third party network s in view of at least the following. The supplied information on operation of the insured entity can be highly segmented since service provider platform can select particular groups of one or more insured entities e.g. vehicles and associated devices or human agents e.g. occupant s of the insured vehicles . Accordingly as described supra advertisement can be highly customized and thus the third party network or the service provider platform can push advertisement content s and promotional material s with enhanced likelihood of engagement e.g. purchase offline or online store visit s subscription to service adoption of membership in service club s such as a wholesale purchase and so forth.

In an aspect of example system to implement monetization of collected or available information on operation of an vehicle a transaction component can commit an agreement to supply at least a portion of collected or available information on operation of the vehicle in exchange of payment or compensation from a buyer e.g. one or more of third party network s of the information. To commit the agreement for example transaction component can retain the agreement terms in memory and install or configure a firmware of software application that implements the term s of the agreement. The term s of the agreement can regulate at least one of the scope of information associated with operation of an insured entity e.g. the insured vehicle that is supplied to the third party network or any other component that consumes the information on operation of the insured vehicle delivery aspects such as delivery schedules delivery events etc. duration of the agreement termination clause s or the like. The term s of the agreement also can determine one or more allocations of resources for advertisement in at least one of the insured vehicle or a device linked thereto. In an aspect transaction component can allocate resources for advertisement of a product or service in the insured vehicle or a device linked thereto in accordance with the term s of the agreement. In one or more embodiments to allocate the resources for advertisement transaction component can execute at least in part the installed or configured firmware or software application s that implements the term s of the agreement. Moreover the term s of the agreement also regulate billing feature s of the agreement wherein the billing feature s include at least one of billing model s billing cycles promotional term s or the like. To implement billing of the supplied information on operation of the insured entity e.g. vehicle and effect the monetization thereof billing component can effect the billing feature s of a committed agreement. Billing component can receive the financial compensation in accordance with the billing feature s of the committed agreement or as regulated at least in part by such agreement. Transaction component can configure and retain such features in billing data store which also includes current and historical billing records for a group of third party networks that have acquired access to a supply of information on operation of the insured entity e.g. the insured vehicle.

If the information on operation of the insured entity e.g. vehicle is monetized through commercialization of advertisement resources billing component can implement various billing models based on response of a beneficiary e.g. an operator of an insured vehicle or an agent human or otherwise associated therewith to an advertisement impression e.g. rendered content that composes the advertisement. The advertisement impression can be delivered to a vehicle through access network s as part of content s as described supra and the response of the beneficiary or the agent associated therewith can be received as part of signaling which can be produced by a component such as benefit display component . As an example at least one of a cost per click CPC model a cost per gesture CPG model or a cost per action CPA model can be implemented. Click s gesture s or action s in response to the advertisement impression can incur predetermined charges that are assessed to the third party network that receives the performance information. The advertisement impression can be rendered in an on board vehicle display that allows input e.g. via touch screen from an operator or an occupant of the vehicle to respond to the advertisement through a click a gesture or an action e.g. purchase of an advertised product .

In an aspect for response s to an advertisement or advertisement impression that entail an action transaction component can process at least in part the action. For instance purchases can be enabled through billing information e.g. credit card record s of a beneficiary associated with the insured entity e.g. vehicle in which the action occurs.

In another aspect of advertisement benefit generation component can generate at least part of content associated with advertisement that is pushed to an insured entity or a component therein e.g. benefit display component as part of monetization of information on operation of the insured entity. Accordingly benefit generation component and billing component can form an advertisement platform. Advertisement content also can be generated at the third party network that consumes e.g. purchases the information on operation of an insured entity and advertisement platform that resides within such third party network can generated the advertisement content. As discussed supra advertisement content generated by benefit generation component or an advertisement platform in the third party network s can comprise a set of incentive offers associated with the insurance benefit for the vehicle based in part on at least one of the information on operation of the vehicle and available historical information on operation of the vehicle.

As part of monetization of the information on operation of an insured entity service provider platform via for example transaction component can adjust the scope of supplied information in accordance with configurable privacy term s established by a beneficiary of an insured entity. Such privacy term s can be retained in beneficiary database and can complement or supplement privacy settings e.g. privacy criteria configured by the beneficiary to control the scope of performance information e.g. record s that are provided to service provider platform or third party network s . Privacy term s and the privacy settings e.g. privacy criteria can be the same or substantially the same.

In view of the example systems shown and described above methodologies can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter as illustrated in . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies might be shown and described as a series of blocks it is to be understood and appreciated that the disclosed aspects are not limited by the number or order of blocks as some blocks may occur in different orders and or at substantially the same time with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover not all illustrated and or described blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter. It is to be appreciated that the functionality associated with the blocks may be implemented by software hardware a combination thereof or any other suitable means e.g. device system process component . One example implementation of such functionality can include execution of code instructions retained in a computer readable medium or a device readable medium by a processor. Additionally it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to various devices. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram.

At a portion of the collected performance information can be supplied based at least in part on predetermined criteria. The predetermined criteria can be configured by an insurance beneficiary and thus can represent privacy criteria the predetermined criteria can be dependent on an intended recipient of the performance information to be supplied. For example a first set of criteria can be established for a provider of the insurance benefit s whereas a second set of criteria can be established for a law enforcement agency or a third party network.

At a disclosure of a set of optional incentives can be received at least one of the incentives in the set of optional incentives is generated based at least in part on the supplied performance information. At it is determined if at least one incentive in the set of optional incentives is elected. Determination can be accomplished through detection of input received from an operator of an insured entity e.g. a motor vehicle for which the performance information is collected. As described supra the input can be received through a display component e.g. . An affirmative determination leads to in which an indication of election of at least one incentive in the set of optional incentives is delivered. The election also can convey a level of performance information that is agreed to be delivered as part of enjoying the elected benefit. Conversely flow is directed to in which additional performance information is collected.

At content based at least in part on the at least one elected optional incentive is received. Content can include at least one of notification of an elected insurance benefit and feature s thereof rate acquired insurance coverage insured entities etc. educational material related to insured entity such as defensive driving tips if case of car insurance benefits of exercising for blood glucose management in case of health insurance an advertisement a merchandise coupon a service voucher a pass code to prepaid wireless minutes a pass code to media content downloadable from a website etc or a service credit and notification thereof or the like. Subsequent to enactment of flow is directed to for further collection of performance information.

At a set of incentive offers related to time dependent insurance benefit s is generated based at least in part on the received performance information. The set of incentive offers can include the optional incentives discussed supra in connection with example method . In particular incentive offer s can include provision of insurance benefit s at deeply discounted rates e.g. almost free of charge in exchange for rich highly detailed performance information. At the set of incentive offers is conveyed.

At it is determined if the set of incentive offers is to be updated or a new set of incentive offers is to be generated. Determination can be based at least in part on the received performance information and historical performance information available to a functional element that enacts the subject example block or method. As an illustration if received performance information displays substantially the same correlations as available historical data e.g. a moving average of velocity remains unchanged then the set of incentive offers need not be updated. Determination also can be based at least in part on signaling received in response to the delivered set of incentive offer s in particular if an indication to revoke delivery of incentive offer s is received no further set of incentive offer s are updated or generated. If outcome of is affirmative flow is directed to act . Conversely the subject example method can be terminated.

At the record of performance for a specific performance period is generated. As described supra for example the performance period can be adaptive and adjusted according to the particular record of performance. At access to the record of operation is regulated based at least in part on at least one of the set of criteria the service provider or the third party network. At based on access regulation at least part of the records is delivered or withheld.

At resources for advertisement of a product in at least one of the vehicle or a device linked thereto are allocated. Advertisement of the product can be tailored to aspects of the accessed information on operation which can reveal contextual information related to an operator or occupant s of the vehicle. Thus such advertisement and the product itself can be accurately targeted to the operator or occupant s or focused on the vehicle. The device can be integrated in the vehicle e.g. navigation system maneuvering system head up display or the like. In addition or in the alternative the device can be most any add one device in the vehicle such as a satellite based navigation unit or a most any electronic appliance e.g. mobile device s utilized by an operator or occupant of the vehicle. The device integrated to the vehicle the add on device or the electronic appliance can render information to an end user e.g. the operator or occupant of the vehicle via for example a display screen a loud speaker or any other one or more components that can supply sound images token s or stimuli that deliver information to the end user. The resources that are allocated for advertisement can include radio channel s or radio airtime in which advertisement can be delivered. Additionally or alternatively resources can include at least one of i space in on board displays in the vehicle such as display of a navigation unit a dashboard section s of windshield portion s of steering wheel or a dedicated device and associated component s and circuitry that manages collection of operation information or ii space in display s in the device linked functionally or otherwise to the vehicle. In a scenario in which the subject example method is effected for a person as the insured entity a device that is linked to the person and in which resources for advertisement are allocated can be a wearable device or portable device such as a helmet mounted display a head mounted display e.g. glasses a pedometer a mobile telephone a media player or the like. In an alternative or additional scenario in which the subject example method is effected for a house as the insured entity the device that is linked to the house and in which resources for advertisement are allocated can be most any or any electronic or electric appliance that operates in the house and can render information to an end user via for example a display screen a loud speaker or any other mechanism or component that can convey sound images or other stimuli that convey information. For instance the device can be a television set a radio tuner set a wireline telephone device with display component s e.g. a display screen or the like.

At payment is collected from the advertisement platform in exchange for the allocation of resources for advertisement of the product in at least one of the vehicle or device linked thereto. In an aspect collecting payment includes utilizing one or more models of payment based on feedback or response from an operator or occupant of the vehicle to the advertisement of the product. For instance at least one of a cost per click CPC model a cost per gesture CPG model or a cost per action CPA model can be implemented in which predetermined charges are assessed to the advertisement platform if advertisement is rendered in an on board vehicle display that allows input e.g. via touch screen from an operator or occupant of the vehicle and an occupant of the vehicle responds to the advertisement through a click or an action. It should be appreciated that in one or more embodiments CPC model can be part of a cost per gesture CPG model in which for instance speech or motion response to advertisement e.g. an operator verbally requests details on advertised product through radio equipment that renders advertisement can be accounted as feedback to the advertisement and thus incur charges for advertisement platform.

At compensation is received from the advertisement platform if a transaction related to the product is effected as a result of the advertisement of the product in at least one of the vehicle or the device linked thereto. In an aspect the transaction can be effected during operation of the vehicle and by directing a gesture to a dedicated operator machine interface in the vehicle for which information on operation is accessed or advertisement is rendered.

A service provider e.g. insurance carrier that affords insurance benefit s for the vehicle can employ at least one of the payment or compensation from the advertisement platform to subsidize insurance benefit s e.g. insurance coverage for the vehicle and thus incentivize specific types of insurance benefit s such as real time or nearly real time insurance coverage plans. In addition for the service provider e.g. insurance carrier such payment or compensation can mitigate financial risk s associated with provision of insurance benefit s since the payment or the compensation is a source of revenue that originates from operation of the vehicle which is the source of risk s associated with insurance coverage. Moreover at least one of payment or compensation can subsidize at least part of cost of specific service s utilized by operator s or occupant s of the vehicle for which information on operation or performance of the vehicle is accessed the specific service s can include wireless service vehicle maintenance or repairs or the like. In one or more scenarios subsidies can render the specific service s free of charge through rebates or service vouchers As an example insurance carrier or advertisement platform can liquidate at least a portion of cost of delivering mobile instant messages from within the vehicle for which information on operation is accessed. As another example insurance carrier can pay e.g. reimburse expense of routine oil and lube changes for the vehicle for which information on operation is accessed.

Referring now to there is illustrated a block diagram of a computer environment that can execute or implement the disclosed architecture or portion s thereof.

This includes at least Wi Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

Wi Fi or Wireless Fidelity allows connection to the Internet from home in a hotel room or at work without wires. Wi Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. computers to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 a b g etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A Wi Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet . Wi Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands at an 11 Mbps 802.11a or 54 Mbps 802.11b data rate for example or with products that contain both bands dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.

Referring now to there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of an exemplary computing environment in accordance with the various aspects. The system includes one or more client s . The client s can be hardware and or software e.g. threads processes computing devices . The client s can house cookie s and or associated contextual information by employing the various aspects for example.

The system also includes one or more server s . The server s can also be hardware and or software e.g. threads processes computing devices . The servers can house threads to perform transformations by employing the various aspects for example. One possible communication between a client and a server can be in the form of a data packet adapted to be transmitted between two or more computer processes. The data packet may include a cookie and or associated contextual information for example. The system includes a communication framework e.g. a global communication network such as the Internet that can be employed to facilitate communications between the client s and the server s .

Communications can be facilitated through a wired including optical fiber and or wireless technology. The client s are operatively connected to one or more client data store s that can be employed to store information local to the client s e.g. cookie s and or associated contextual information . Similarly the server s are operatively connected to one or more server data store s that can be employed to store information local to the servers .

What has been described above includes examples of the various aspects. It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the various aspects but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible.
