This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 297 134 filed Nov. 15 2011 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ESTIMATING DEMAND FOR ATTRACTIONS which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 499 636 filed Jun. 21 2011 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MATCHING VENUES AND ATTRACTIONS. The entire contents of the applications identified in this paragraph are incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.

This disclosure relates to information systems technology and to technology for estimating demand for attractions.

Places of interest such as amusement parks museums convention centers zoos campuses theaters clubs concert halls performing arts centers hospitals retail stores and shopping malls often host attractions or talent that draw an audience. A talent or attraction that has widespread popularity such as for example well known or popular artists performers exhibits restaurants shops products services productions shows and rides can generate a predictable return on investment for venue operators. An operator that fills its venue with lesser known attractions or talent may face greater risk of audience indifference and financial failure. The relative scarcity of attractions and talent with widespread popularity may cause venue operators to take a risk on an unproven item. Existing techniques for matching venues with attractions and or talent suffer from various drawbacks.

Example embodiments described herein have several features no single one of which is indispensible or solely responsible for their desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the claims some of the advantageous features of some embodiments will now be summarized.

Certain embodiments disclosed herein provide devices systems and methods of using location based virtual audience feedback to estimate interest in an attraction or talent at one or more venues. Certain embodiments provide devices systems and methods of using location based virtual audience feedback and or other audience data to estimate interest in a plurality of attractions or other items of interest at a particular venue.

Advantageously the location based virtual audience feedback may allow audience members that have not been measured by traditional metrics such as surveys to express their interest in and demand for an attraction product or service. Thus the systems and methods described herein may advantageously detect demand from the grassroots without needing to pass through a filter of record labels media executives or the like. In this way the systems and methods disclosed herein can help attractions that have not been recognized by traditional channels to achieve success based on direct feedback and indications of interest from individual consumers.

A provider of a good or service determines how to allocate or distribute the good or service by predicting or guessing where there will be demand for the good or service. Information about actual demand for many goods and services may be incomplete or nonexistent thereby causing the provider to rely on geographic demographic technographic psychographic and or other market segmentation data to make an informed guess about the level of demand in a particular region. In some cases the provider may use opinions or popular beliefs about a region to guess the level of demand. Market segmentation data opinions and popular beliefs can have widely varying accuracy and can form an imperfect picture of the actual demand for the good or service. Further such data opinions popular beliefs and other widely available information may provide little or no insight into demand for certain goods and services particularly goods and services that are new or not widely known.

Access to pertinent and timely information about actual demand for a good or service has traditionally been rare. Providers seeking such information have used tools such as opinion polls surveys and market sampling to collect data reflecting actual demand. The cost of using these and other market research tools that are provider driven can be prohibitively high particularly when the good or service in question does not already have widespread popularity. In addition it may be difficult for such tools to identify rapid changes in interest for a good or service which might cause a provider to miss a substantial market opportunity. Such difficulties can also affect an operator of a venue that seeks to match the venue with suitable goods services or other attractions.

A venue operator often seeks to place attractions at its venue that draw an audience and make the venue profitable and or successful. The operator of a mall seeks to place retail stores in the mall that will strongly draw shoppers from the region surrounding the mall. A hospital operator brings in doctors and medical equipment that will provide medical care demanded by the population in a target area. A concert hall operator brings in performers that are popular in the area where the concert hall is located. A venue operator might be unable to judge the demand for an attraction that is not widely known even though concentrations of interest in the attraction might exist in the immediate vicinity of the venue.

In some embodiments a demand prediction system is configured to receive indications of interest in one or more attractions directly or indirectly from consumers. The system can use the indications of interest information about the geographic location of the consumers and other collected data to predict the actual demand for an attraction. The system can be configured to generate a demand prediction for an attraction within a defined geographical region or within other defined parameters such as for example within a defined market segment . In certain embodiments a demand prediction system is configured to generate a demand prediction for multiple attractions within a defined market segment for an attraction within multiple defined market segments and or for multiple attractions within multiple defined market segments.

Some embodiments provide a system for predicting demand for a good service or other attraction in a market segment based on direct or indirect indications of interest generated by consumers. For example a demand prediction system can be configured to predict the size of an audience for an attraction if the attraction were to be hosted at a particular venue. The system can include or be connected to sources of attraction information and venue information. The term attraction is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes without limitation persons such as for example artists performers entertainers and professionals exhibits such as for example art collections artifacts rare items and product displays businesses such as for example retailers and service providers shows such as for example dramatic presentations musical performances comedy routines and variety shows acts goods services other items that draw interest from consumers and combinations of items. The term consumer is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes without limitation a prospective purchaser of a good or service a potential member of an audience or any other person within a market segment including a person who does not need to pay money to consume an item of interest. The term venue is used in its broad and ordinary sense and includes without limitation a plot of land a building a development a hall a theater a sport facility a music facility or another geographic location.

A demand prediction system can receive indications of interest for an attraction from consumers. The demand prediction system can be configured to receive other consumer data including for example location information for individual consumers a participation metric based on a rate of consumer participation in past events and a social influence metric based on how actions of consumers influence others and or how consumers are influenced by others. The demand prediction system can use the indications of interest and other consumer data to predict the demand for the attraction if it were to be matched with the venue. The demand prediction can be sent to an operator of the attraction or to an operator of the venue.

As indicated above the methods and systems described herein provide a general mechanism for matching consumer demand to any type of attraction. The embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to any particular type of attraction. However to provide concrete examples of how the systems and methods may be used particular illustrative examples of the use of the systems and methods in particular industries will now be described. A person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the inventions are not limited to these examples.

For example some embodiments provide a system for matching a venue with one or more performers. The system can include a database that stores information about venues for holding performances performers that perform acts of entertainment and fans of the performers. The system can include a computer that has access to the database and that is configured to receive indications of interest from fans. Each indication of interest can be an action taken by a fan that shows that the fan is interested in a specific performer. The system can determine based upon the indications of interest interest metrics representing individual fans degree of interest in specific performers. The system determines distances between geographic locations of fans and venues. The system can determine participation metrics representing each fan s rate of participation in past performances. In some embodiments the system is configured to determine social influence metrics that represent the likelihood that a fan will be influenced by the actions of others.

The system can calculate likelihoods that specific fans will attend the performance by a specific performer at a specific venue. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics distances participation metrics and social influence metrics gathered by the system. The system can calculate an estimate of the attendance at a performance by a performer at a specific venue by summing the likelihoods that specific fans will attend the performance. The system can use the estimate of attendance to match a venue with the performer.

In some embodiments the system includes a fan feedback subsystem configured to record the fan actions that constitute indications of interest. The fan feedback subsystem can include a user interface element operable by the fans to indicate interest in a particular performer. The user interface element can be configured to be operated repeatedly. A value of an interest metric can be based on the number of times that the user interface element is operated. The number of times and interval when a fan can operate the user interface element can be limited by one or more thresholds. The interest metrics distances participation metrics and social influence metrics can be weighted according to their relative importance in calculating the likelihoods of attendance.

The interest metrics can be based at least in part on indications of how recently an indication of interest occurred. The interest metrics can be used to calculate estimated attendance at performances by performers that are similar to specific performers for whom fans have made previous indications of interest.

Some embodiments provide a system for calculating a total participation estimate for one or more attractions at a venue. The system can include a data store the stores data associated with members of the perspective audience for the one or more attractions and a computing device in communication with the data store. The computing device can be configured to receive data directly or indirectly from members of the perspective audience. The data received from members of the audience can include for example for each individual member of the perspective audience an attraction interest metric based on actions taken by an audience member indicating interest in a particular attraction and a location metric based on the geographic location of the audience member. The computing device can be configured to calculate an individual participation expectation value for each individual member of the perspective audience. The individual participation expectation value can be calculated at least partially from the attraction interest metric of the audience member and the distance between the geographic location of the audience member and the venue. The computing device can be configured to calculate the total participation estimate for at least one of the one or more attractions if the at least one of the one or more attractions were to be placed at the venue by summing the individual participation expectation values of the perspective audience members.

The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by tracking a number of times when a member of the perspective audience operates a user interface element configured to register interest in an attraction.

The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by tracking a number of times when a member of the prospective audience searches for an attraction using the World Wide Web. The computing device can be configured to receive the attraction interest metric by receiving information about the interests of a member of the prospective audience.

The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by obtaining geographical location information automatically from an electronic device used by the audience member. The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by receiving Global Positioning System data. The computing device can be configured to receive the location metric by logging an IP address of an electronic device used by the audience member.

Certain embodiments provide a computer implemented method for estimating participation in one or more attractions at a venue. The method can include receiving data directly or indirectly from members of the perspective audience for the one or more attractions. The data can include for each individual member of the perspective audience an attraction interest metric based on actions taken by an audience member indicating interest in a particular attraction and one or more additional metrics the one or more additional metrics including a social influence metric based on how actions of the audience member influence other members of the perspective audience. The method can include calculating an individual participation expectation value for each individual member of the perspective audience. The individual participation expectation value can be calculated at leak partially from the attraction interest metric of the audience member and social influence metrics of members of the perspective audience. The method can include calculating a total participation estimate for at least one of the one or more attractions if the at least one of the one or more attractions were to be placed at the venue by summing the individual participation expectation values of the prospective audience members.

The one or more additional metrics can include a participation metric based on a rate of audience member participation in past attractions. The one or more additional metrics can include a location metric based on a geographic location of the audience member. The individual participation expectation value is calculated at least partially from the participation metric the location metric and the location of the venue. The attraction interest metric can be based on a number of times when a member of the perspective audience operates a user interface element configured to register interest in an attraction.

Some embodiments provide a system for generating a demand prediction for an event. The system can include a database that stores information about an attraction venues that are capable of hosting the attraction and consumers who may have interest in the attraction. A computer that has access to the database can be configured to receive indications of interest from at least some of the consumers. Each indication of interest can be generated by an action performed by an interested consumer using an electronic device configured to send indications of interest to the computer. Each indication of interest indicates that the interested consumer may have interest in the attraction or interest in a category of attractions to which the attraction belongs. In certain embodiments the computer is configured to receive location information that identifies a location corresponding to each interested consumer. Interest metrics representing a level of interest in the attraction for each interested consumer can be determined. The interest metrics can be based at least partially on the received indications of interest. Likelihoods that specific consumers would attend an event at a specific venue featuring the attraction can be calculated. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics the location information a location of the specific venue other information or a combination of information. The computer is configured to calculate a demand prediction for the event by summing the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.

The computer can be configured to receive indications of interest by receiving a notification when the at least one of the consumers uses an electronic device to search for an attraction. Other activities including for example visiting an attraction profile page operating a user interface element adapted to express consumer interest in an attraction or connecting with a person associated with an attraction on a social network can also trigger notifications to the computer that the consumer may have interest in the attraction.

In some embodiments the computer is configured to determine social influence metrics representing likelihoods that consumers will be influenced by actions of others and account for the social influence metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. The computer can be configured to determine participation metrics representing a rate of participation in past events for each interested consumer and account for the participation metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.

In certain embodiments the computer is configured to estimate the profitability of the event based at least partially on the demand prediction for the event. The computer can be configured to provide information about one or more events that are estimated to be most profitable to an agent for the attraction. The computer can be configured to identify one or more geographical regions where the demand prediction is highest and match the attraction with a proposed venue within each of the one or more geographical regions. In some embodiments the proposed venue would result in an event with the highest estimated profitability compared to other venues within the geographical region of the proposed venue.

Certain embodiments provide a computer implemented method of calculating a demand prediction for an event. The method can include receiving indications of interest from consumers wherein each indication of interest is generated by an action performed by an interested consumer using an electronic device and wherein each indication of interest shows that the interested consumer may have interest in an attraction or interest in a category of attractions to which the attraction belongs. Location information that identifies a location corresponding to each interested consumer is received. The method can include determining interest metrics representing a level of interest in the attraction for each interested consumer wherein the interest metrics are based at least partially on the received indications of interest. Likelihoods that specific consumers would attend an event at a specific venue featuring the attraction are calculated. The calculation can take into account the interest metrics the location information a location of the specific venue other factors or a combination of factors. A demand prediction for the event can be calculated by summing the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.

The method can include identifying one or more geographical regions where there is a concentration of interest in the attraction based on one or more demand predictions. The attraction can be matched with a proposed venue within each of the one or more geographical regions. The proposed venue can be selected such that the projected profitability of the event at the proposed venue is greater than or equal to the projected profitability of an event featuring the same attraction at another venue within the same geographical region as the proposed venue.

The method can include determining social influence metrics representing likelihoods that consumers will be influenced by actions of others and accounting for the social influence metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. In some embodiments the method includes determining participation metrics representing a rate of participation in past events for each interested consumer and accounting for the participation metrics in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event.

In certain embodiments the method includes weighting the interest metrics and the location information according to their relative importance in calculating the likelihoods that specific consumers would attend the event. The interest metrics can be based in part on how recently the indications of interest occurred on a number of times that a consumer operates a user interface element configured to register interest in the attraction on other factors or on a combination of factors.

The demand prediction can be sent to an operator of the attraction or to an operator of the venue.

The schematic diagram shown in illustrates a technique for predicting demand for goods at a venue . In the illustrated diagram a consumer generates indications of interest generally referred to herein as kicks that indicate that the consumer is interested in consuming one or more goods . The kicks can be generated by actions of the consumer that directly or indirectly indicate interest in the goods . Examples of such indications of interest can include without limitation search engine queries social network connections direct virtual indications of interest for example generated by operating a user interface element on a Web page or in an application program website visits purchases of goods or services purchases of event tickets other consumer behaviors or a combination of behaviors. The kicks or information about the kicks can be counted measured or otherwise collected by an analysis system generally referred to herein as a kick engine configured to generate a demand prediction from the kicks and or other information about the consumer . For example the kick engine can calculate a probability that the consumer will consume the goods . The kick engine can be configured to generate a demand prediction by tabulating the probabilities that each consumer in a geographic region will consume the goods . The demand prediction can be sent to an operator of the venue who can use the demand prediction to make decisions about what goods to bring to its venue .

The matching system can include a data store of information about goods services and other attractions in which the consumers may have interest. A provider of an attraction can create a profile associated with the attraction that allows consumers to identify the attraction. In some embodiments the matching system allows provider to communicate with one or more consumers . In this manner the provider can promote its attraction or provide news or other updates regarding its attraction. The matching system is configured to generate a local demand estimate for the attraction using the indications of interest and the location information received from the consumers . The matching system sends the local demand estimates for one or more attractions to the operator of a venue . The operator can use the local demand estimates in selecting one or more attractions to bring to its venue .

In some embodiments the computing system includes one or more processors. The processors can be one or more general purpose single core or multi core microprocessors such as for example a Pentium processor a Pentium II processor a Pentium Pro processor a Pentium III processor Pentium 4 processor a Core Duo processor a Core 2 Duo processor a Xeon processor an Itanium processor a Pentium M processor an x86 processor an Athlon processor an 8051 processor a MIPS processor a PowerPC processor an ALPHA processor etc. In addition one or more of the processors can be a special purpose microprocessor such as a digital signal processor.

The computing system can also include a network interface module that facilitates communication between the computer system and clients via the communications network .

The network interface module can use a variety of network protocols. In one embodiment the network interface module implements TCP IP. However it is to be appreciated that other types of network communication protocols such as for example Point to Point Protocol PPP Server Message Block SMB Serial Line Internet Protocol SLIP tunneling PPP AppleTalk Ethernet Wi Fi etc. may also be used.

The computing system can include memory. Memory can include for example processor cache memory such as processor core specific or cache memory shared by multiple processor cores dynamic random access memory DRAM static random access access memory SRAM or any other type of memory device capable of storing computer data instructions or program code. The computing system can also include optional storage. Storage can include for example one or more hard disk drives floppy disks flash memory magnetic storage media CD ROMs DVDs optical storage media or any other type of storage device capable of storing computer data instructions and or program code.

The computing system may be used in connection with various operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 3. X Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows NT Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows CE Palm Pilot OS OS 2 Apple MacOS MacOS X MacOS X Server Disk Operating System DOS UNIX Linux VxWorks or IBM OS 2 Sun OS Solaris OS IRIX OS operating systems etc.

In some embodiments the computing system includes a data interface configured to communicate with the clients . For example the data interface can include program code for receiving indications of interest receiving other data sending demand predictions sending other data and or communicating configuration information to the clients . The computing system can maintain a data store that contains information used by the demand calculation engine and or the data interface . The demand calculation engine includes program code for generating a demand prediction using indications of interest received from clients and or from other data available to the computing system .

As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the computing system may include various sub routines procedures definitional statements and macros. Each of the foregoing modules are typically separately compiled and linked into a single executable program. However it is to be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the processes that are performed by selected ones of the modules may be arbitrarily redistributed to one of the other modules combined together in a single module made available in a shareable dynamic link library or partitioned in any other logical way.

In embodiment illustrated in the computing system communicates with a plurality of clients . Each of the clients can be a personal computer a laptop computer a handheld computing device a portable computing device a server a computer workstation a local area network of individual computers an interactive kiosk a personal digital assistant an interactive wireless communications device a handheld computer an embedded computing device or the like including one or more processors memory storage and a network interface for communicating with the network as described above. The clients can be used by consumers operators of attractions operators of venues artists advertisers administrators and others that send information to or receive information from the computing system .

The communications network may include one or more of any type of electronically connected group of computers including for instance the following networks a virtual private network a public Internet a private Internet a secure Internet a private network a public network a value added network a wired network a wireless network an intranet etc. In addition the connectivity to the network can be for example a modem Ethernet IEEE 802.3 Gigabit Ethernet 10 Gigabit Ethernet Token Ring IEEE 802.5 Fiber Distributed Datalink Interface FDDI Frame Relay InfiniBand Myrinet Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM or another interface. The communications network may connect to the computing system and the clients for example by use of a modem or by use of a network interface card that resides in each of the systems.

In addition the same or different communications networks may be used to facilitate communication between the first client and the computing system between the second client and the computing system between the third client and the computing system and between the any other client and the computing system .

In some embodiments the demand prediction system is configured to calculate the probability that each consumer in a market segment will attend a specific event. Data collected from each consumer such as for example data from the consumer s social network and from the consumer s other interactions including direct and indirect indications of interest can be used to estimate the probability that the consumer will attend an event purchase a good or perform another action with respect to an item of interest. For purposes of illustration and not limitation example techniques will now be described for estimating the probability that the consumer will participate in an event at a venue and matching an attraction with the venue to create an event.

Logistic regression can be used to estimate the probability that each audience member will attend an event using a variety of categorical discrete or continuous variables. In some embodiments the method is flexible and easy to adapt to new variables that allow the accuracy of the prediction to improve. Logistic regression also provides a way to analyze the utility of individual variables and provides a way to select the best variables to use in predicting attendance.

Each consumer can be associated with a set of features such as gender age history of kicks history of event attendance and or other features. These features are used during the probability calculation as different user parameter values or xvalues for each consumer. One or more user parameter values of a consumer are combined into a single value or Z score which appears on the horizontal axis in . The Z score can be translated into a probability of attendance which appears as the vertical axis .

The different x values which feed into the Z score can be combined with different weights according to their importance. Logistic regression can be used to pick the best weights to match what actually occurs given a set of x values that are known.

Techniques for selecting the set of x values to use will now be discussed. In some embodiments an iterative procedure is used to select the best set of x values from a large set of possible x values. The x values are selected to do the best job of predicting probabilities while minimizing model complexity. In some embodiments a model of attendance is formulated by starting with relatively few x values that provide a good fit to observed data. Additional x values are added until new values do not provide enough improvement to justify their inclusion in the model.

In certain embodiments the set of x values includes one or more values provided by the user such as for example age or gender. The set of x values can also include one or more event dependent values such as for example the distance between the consumer and the venue or a feature of the consumer that is particular to the attraction. The set of x values can include one or more values that can be computed based on the interaction of consumers with a website such as for example the number of times that a consumer has kicked or virtually indicated interest in the artist within a recent time period such as for example within the preceding 90 days . The set of x values can include one or more values derived from the interaction of a consumer with his or her social network. There are many ways by which values can be derived from social network events. For example an x value can be assigned if the consumer has connected with an artist on a social network or has added the artist to a list of hobbies or personal preferences. Additionally the effect of the consumer s social network on behavior can be considered. A consumer that frequently follows another person by repeating the actions of the other person can be identified as influenced by that person. Information about the activities of influential persons can be used to better estimate the actions of a consumer.

Different models of participation can be used for an individual consumer depending on the type of information available for the consumer. For a consumer who does not have much history from which to derive x values or who has not shared social network details a different model may better determine the probability of attendance than for a consumer who has a wealth of data available. For this reason different models can be trained for different groups of users. Consumers for whom little data is available can be modeled using a simple model that does not include some or all of the x values available for other consumers.

In some embodiments attendance at an event can be modeled as a Bernoulli distributed random variable where the probability of attendance is p 

The probability of attendance can be modeled as a function of user features. User features are what is known about the consumer from his or her virtual indications of interest from other activities and from information collected from his or her social network.

In certain embodiments a logistic regression model employs a plurality of useful statistics to represent user information. Almost any information can be used as to generate statistics to be used as model parameters. Certain examples of parameters are set forth hereinafter. Additional or alternative parameters can be used if necessary. Many variations are possible.

Social influence is an example of a user parameter that can assist in determining a demand prediction. illustrates an example model of user influence in a social network system . Each user shown in is connected to one or more other users by an arrow . Each arrow points in a direction of a user who is influenced by another user of the social network system . The weight of the arrow is related to how influential the relationship is. A more influential user can have a stronger effect on the actions of his or her neighbor as represented by a heavy weight arrow . As shown in a user can be influential for some users but not influential for other users .

In some embodiments each user of a website application or mobile application that sends kicks to the demand prediction system has a budget of M kick actions that can be taken per day. Each kick of an artist or other attraction is a request for the artist to perform in an event near the user. Kick events can be tracked in different ways. For example ways of tracking kicks include tracking 1 the total kicks made by a user and 2 the kicks made by a user in a recent window. As used herein Krepresents the number of all made by the user and K represents the number of kicks made in the time window. The number of kicks of artist ais K and likewise the number of kicks of the artist in the recent window is K .

There are many ways in which the kick history can be incorporated into the model. A model selection strategy can be used to limit the number of variables using kick data that are included. In the expressions set forth herein the indicator function I X is 1 when statement X is true and 0 otherwise. The following are examples of user parameters that can be defined using kick history data 

In addition to recording kicks the origin of the kicks can also be recorded. A user who kicks an artist from a phone as well as two different computers may be considered more serious about the artist. Variables including these parameters can be included in the model.

In certain embodiments one or more user parameters is based on the distance between a consumer and a venue. For example distance to the event d can be Modeled as three distinct variables each corresponding to a different type of consumer behavior.

The three distinct distance variables can be written as x x x which are indicator variables that convey the region the distance is within. An interaction term 

If E is the set of events where the user kicked the artist before the event took place and where the event took place within distance Mof the user the rate of attendance is given by the following expression 

The friends of a user can be assumed to have some influence on event attendance. In some embodiments it can be assumed that the attendance of the friends is independent from the user s attendance. Thus the effect of the user s social network can be measured through static statistics independent of friends attendance.

Some simple parameters which depend only on features of the social network can be computed. For a user u the set of users that are friends with u are N u . Examples of parameters that can be used in the model include 

Many models of social influence are built to anticipate activation of nodes or the cascade of activity passing through a network. In some embodiments the model is configured to look further ahead than the next group of users to change state based on the local network. In some embodiments the demand prediction system does not have complete information on attendance which would may complicate activation or cascade models.

In certain embodiments a model uses features of the user s social network as parameters in a logistic regression model. A user parameter can be configured to provide a measure of social influence in the network for weighting or comparing two users friends. The demand prediction system can determine weights to associate with users based on their interactions.

A user can carry out many repetitive actions such as for example kicking an artist. In order to account for repetitive actions the demand prediction system can consider any action that a user performs twice within a certain window as self influenced and not available for other users to take credit for. When the demand prediction system has a complete log of all actions taken by all users it can define influence P of user v on user u as the amount of credit for each of user u s actions that v can take.

The set of actions carried out within a recent window by user u which can be considered not to be self influenced is given as A. For each action a A the model can consider the set of friends of u that have recently carried out the action. The model can assign each of the friends equal fractional credit. The influence of user v on u is the sum of the fractions of all influences of u by v in the time window over all potential influence events.

The model can define Aas an action by v that was carried out by u within the time window of influence. Scan be defined as the set of users who like v carried out the action a before u within the time window. The influence of user v on user u can be expressed as 

These influence values can be used as weights in estimating the probability of a user taking action given the social network.

Another parameter that can be used in the model is the ease of influencing a user. If a user frequently follows others the user may be easily influenced. If the user is the first person in his or her social network to take an action the user may not be easily influenced. An expression that accounts for ease of influence can include interaction terms and network terms.

One expression that may quantify influence ability is the fraction of actions for which the user was influenced over total actions taken by the user 

For each user and event pair there are a set of features X x x . . . x and the response Ythat was drawn from a Bernoulli with unknown parameter p.

In this generalized linear model a linear model of observations is fit to a function of the unknown parameter . . . 

In logistic regression g is the logit function which allows for any value produced by the right side to be mapped into a probability something that would not be possible if the left side were restricted to the range 0 1 .

The values are the weights assigned to each explanatory variable x. Each xcan be either categorical or continuous.

The coefficients can be interpreted as the odds ratio when a unit increase occurs in variable x. If xincreases by 1 the probability of attendance increases by a factor of e.

In a set of 50 users represented by dots attend the event P 1 or do not P 0 according to the calculated probability from the logistic curve. While attendance is more likely for users with a larger z value there are still some users who do not attend. The same can be seen for z

Recovering the probability of an event given the independent variables is done by inverting the logit function 

The user features from known attendance events are used to determine the parameters of a model of attendance probability. If there are m historical data points with a known response Y and observations X this data can be used to fit the model . . . 

The values chosen are the maximum likelihood estimators. The likelihood of the parameters given the data X X . . . Xis 

For a Bernoulli variable each Yeither contributes por 1 pdepending on whether it is 1 or 0. The likelihood then is 

The circumflex over values that maximize the likelihood are the ML estimators of the parameters . The maximum likelihood estimators have many desirable statistical properties. As the number of samples increase 

Unlike ordinary least squares for logistic regression there is not an algebraic solution for the coefficients. Instead a numerical technique is used to estimate the set of coefficients most likely to generate the observed data.

For a random variable with density x defined in terms of parameters the log likelihood of a parameter given data X X . . . X is

The that maximizes the likelihood can be found through the scoring algorithm which is Newton s method applied to the first derivative in order to identify the maximum. circumflex over circumflex over circumflex over circumflex over where is the estimate for the parameters after n iterations 

Logistic regression solvers are available in many statistical software packages. The algorithm for finding in matrix notation can be described as follows 

The above can be repeated using the new values for A and P every round until the values are stabilized as determined by some stopping criteria such as for example 

Each iteration of Newton s method can be done in O md where d is the number of parameters and m is the number of data points to fit. The efficiency of the method can be improved by using a conjugate gradient CG method to improve the directions of updates.

In practice using the CG algorithm for tens of d and several thousand m the problem can be solved in less then one minute on a standard desktop computer.

In some embodiments it is not known prior to modeling which parameters are the most useful or which parameters should be included. A description of a stepwise procedure to select the best model follows.

The goal is to identify a model which describes the observed data with the minimum number of necessary parameters. To asses the goodness of fit the Akaike information criterion AIC is used AIC 22 log where k is the number of parameters in the model and log L X X . . . X is the same log likelihood as above. A model with a lower AIC score is preferred. The likelihood calculations are performed for each model to make sure that the maximum likelihood is used in each goodness of fit score.

Beginning with the simplest model with only a constant term the parameter that decreases the AIC the most is iteratively added from the set of available predictors. After each variable is added any of the existing variables that is no longer significant is removed.

To avoid overfitting any model that does not do better at predicting a subset of the data is rejected and not used in generating the model.

Given the probabilities of attendance for all users features of the distribution of Y the total attendance of the event can be calculated.

In the event that users are considered independent P YY P Y P Y the total number of attendees is given by Y Y. The variable Y has expectation E Y p but because of the many pvalues there is not a closed form expression for variance.

Properties of the variance of Y are computable. Chernoff bounds exist to provide bounds on tail probabilities which may be useful in producing confidence intervals for attendance.

In some embodiments a matching system such as for example the system described with reference to is configured to match a venue with an attraction to create a proposed event when it is determined that the proposed event would be profitable. Profitability can account for some or all types of benefits that can result from a proposed event including for example revenue non monetary benefits goodwill marketing indirect benefits competitive benefits other benefits or a combination of benefits.

An example of matching will now be described in the context of a venue that plans to sell tickets for a proposed event. The number of tickets sold to the event will depend at least in part on the local demand for the attraction or group of attractions that headline the event. In this context the local demand is the popularity of the group of attractions among the consumers residing in a geographical region surrounding the venue. The geographical region can be sufficiently large to encompass those consumers who can travel to the venue within a reasonable time such as for example within about 10 minutes within about 30 minutes within about an hour within about two hours or within another reasonable period. The reasonableness of travel time can depend on many factors such as for example the size of the venue hosting the event the uniqueness of the event the availability of other events in the geographical region the locations of other venues and so forth. A reasonable travel time for attending live music night at a bar would be less than the reasonable travel time for attending the Super Bowl. Alternatively the geographical region considered can include the entire world for example if the distance between the consumer residence and the venue is a parameter used to filter out consumers who would likely not attend due to unreasonable travel times in predicting the probability of attendance.

The horizontal axis of the plot corresponds to the predicted number of ticket sales for the event. A vertical line intersecting the horizontal axis shows the maximum capacity of the venue. A horizontal line parallel to the horizontal axis shows a range of potential profits for the event. A vertical line intersecting the horizontal line represents an example break even point for the event. The position of the break even point can be influenced by a variety of factors such as for example one or more non revenue components of profitability described previously the cost of operating the venue the cost of the attraction the cost of running the event the cost of marketing the event and so forth. Events where the predicted number of ticket sales falls in a loss region for example the number of ticket sales is less than the break even point are considered unprofitable and may not result in a match between the venue and the attraction. Events where the predicted number of ticket sales falls in a profit region for example the number of ticket sales is greater than or equal to the break even point are considered profitable and may result in a match between the venue and the attraction or a proposed event. Where several events would be profitable over the same time period the matching system can be configured to select only those events with the highest profitability. For example the matching system con be configured to select events where the predicted ticket sales are closest to or furthest above the venue capacity events where the break even point is lowest and or events where the revenue from predicted ticket sales exceeding the break even point is highest.

In some embodiments the matching system is configured to match an attraction with a venue that has a capacity that is slightly or somewhat lower than the ticket sales prediction for an event. The matching system can be configured to determine a match threshold where the demand for tickets will slightly or substantially exceed the supply of tickets by multiplying the venue capacity by a number greater than 1 such as for example a number greater than or equal to about 1.05 greater than or equal to about 1.1 between about 1.01 and 1.5 between about 1.01 and 1.2 between about 1.1 and 1.5 or between any of the numbers listed or by adding a predetermined value such as for example 5 10 50 100 500 1000 or a number between 5 and 1000 inclusive to the venue capacity. The matching system can be configured to preferentially match attractions with venues where the projected ticket sales meet or exceed the match threshold . For example if a band is predicted to sell 100 tickets to consumers within a small geographical area that has multiple venues then the matching system can be configured to match the band with one or more venues in the area that have a capacity of about 90 guests.

In some embodiments the matching system places a restriction on the number of times that an attraction such as for example a band appears within a geographic region. The restriction can configured to prevent or lessen the risk of overexposing a marketplace particularly when a demand prediction model does not account for the possibility that a fan attending an event one night will be less likely to attend the event the following night. In certain embodiments the matching system employs a model that does not count consumers who have recently participated in an event identical or similar to a proposed event.
