The present disclosure relates to an in vehicle apparatus which realizes a handsfree phone call using an in vehicle phone and a handsfree phone call using an external cellular phone connected via a communication portion the in vehicle apparatus having a phonebook function to store phonebook data corresponding to each of the in vehicle phone and the cellular phone.

There is conventionally an in vehicle apparatus equipped with a function to achieve a handsfree phone call by establishing connection with an external cellular phone via a short range wireless communication. Such an in vehicle apparatus is equipped with a data communication module DCM having a function as an in vehicle phone. When the vehicle having the above in vehicle apparatus receives a user who carries a cellular phone the user can perform a handsfree phone call using the cellular phone. In addition even if the above vehicle receives a user who has not a cellular phone the user can perform a handsfree phone call using the in vehicle phone. To that end the above in vehicle apparatus is provided with a phonebook function to store a plurality of separate phonebook data sets dedicated for the connected cellular phone and the in vehicle phone respectively.

Patent document 1 discloses a technology to transmit the phonebook data of the connected cellular phone to the in vehicle apparatus and store the transmitted phonebook data in the in vehicle apparatus. According to the technology the same phonebook data as that stored in the cellular phone can be used in a handsfree phone call using the cellular phone. In contrast the phonebook data of the in vehicle phone can be registered or stored in the in vehicle apparatus when a user can register phonebook data by performing a predetermined input manipulation to a manipulation portion for example touch switch on a touch panel provided in in vehicle apparatus further the registered phonebook data can be edited.

As explained above the phonebook data of the in vehicle phone needs to be registered or edited by an input manipulation for example a manual entry etc. of a user. Therefore registering or editing a great number of phonebook data requires a great number of input manipulations. Thus it is desired to improve usability about the phonebook data of the in vehicle phone.

It is an object of the present disclosure to provide an in vehicle apparatus which can improve usability about phonebook data corresponding to an in vehicle phone.

To achieve the above object according to an example of the present disclosure an in vehicle apparatus is provided as follows. An in vehicle phone is included to perform a voice call via a communication network. A communication portion is included to perform a communication with a portable phone which is brought to the vehicle. A handsfree portion is included to perform i a first handsfree phone call using the portable phone via the communication portion and ii a second handsfree phone call using the in vehicle phone. A first phonebook storage portion is included to store first phonebook data used in the first handsfree phone call using the portable phone. A second phonebook storage portion is included to store second phonebook data used in the second handsfree phone call using the in vehicle phone. A first phonebook management section is included to acquire acquired phonebook data which are stored in the portable phone via the communication portion and store the acquired phonebook data in the first phonebook storage portion as the first phonebook data. A manipulation reception portion is included to receive a predetermined manipulation of a user. A second phonebook management section is included to store copied first phonebook data in the second phonebook storage portion as the second phonebook data when a use permission manipulation of permitting use of the first phonebook data is received by the manipulation reception portion. Herein the copied first phonebook data is a copy of the first phonebook data stored in the first phonebook storage portion.

In the above configuration according to the user s use permission manipulation the first phonebook data acquired from the portable phone is transmitted to the second phonebook storage portion and stored as the second phonebook data. Therefore the registration of the second phonebook data for the in vehicle phone can be easily achieved. In addition even if there are a plurality of second phonebook data i.e. a plurality of phonebook data sets the user is only required to perform a use permission manipulation to an intended one of the plurality of phonebook data sets so as to perform the registration storage process automatically in the in vehicle apparatus. For example it is not necessary to perform troublesome input manipulations such as manual entries of characters of numbers and words. This configuration improves usability about the second phonebook data that is phonebook data corresponding to the in vehicle phone used when performing a handsfree phone call using the in vehicle phone. In addition the transmission process to transmit the above mentioned phonebook data is not performed unless the user s use permission manipulation is received. Therefore the first phonebook data i.e. the phonebook data stored in the portable phone can be prevented from being used unnecessarily thereby raising the security.

An embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained with reference to drawings. is a block diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of an in vehicle apparatus having a handsfree function and a function as an in vehicle phone. The in vehicle apparatus is mounted for example in a vehicle such as an automobile and includes a handsfree unit a display unit and a DCM Data Communication Module . The handsfree unit includes a controller a Bluetooth registered trademark also referred to as BT interface portion a call sound processor a storage portion a display controller and a touch manipulation interface portion .

The controller includes a microcomputer equipped with a CPU ROM RAM etc. and controls an overall operation of the handsfree unit such as a communication operation and a phonebook data management operation. The BT interface portion is compliant with profiles standardized in the BT communication standard such as HFP Hands Free Profile for performing a handsfree communication and PBAP Phone Book Access Profile and OPP Object Push Profile for transmitting phonebook data. Herein the above profiles signify communication protocols defined for functions respectively.

The call sound processor is connected with a microphone and an audio amplifier . The microphone is placed inside of a vehicle compartment such as a position near the steering wheel to easily collect a user s voice or speech. The audio amplifier is placed to be separate from the handsfree unit . A handsfree communication is performed with a BT compliant portable phone also referred to as a cellular phone brought into the compartment of the vehicle. In the handsfree communication when a voice or speech uttered by the user is inputted as a transmit sound via the microphone the call sound processor applies a sound process to the inputted transmit sound and outputs the transmit sound having undergone the sound process to the BT interface portion . In contrast when receiving a reception sound via the BT interface portion the call sound processor outputs the received reception sound to the audio amplifier . When the audio amplifier receives the reception sound from the call sound processor the audio amplifier amplifies the reception sound and outputs the amplified sound via the speakers . The speakers and are placed at positions in the driver s seat door and the passenger seat door respectively for example.

The storage portion has a plurality of storage areas to contain phonebook data outgoing call history data incoming call history data and missed incoming call history data. The phonebook data indicate a correspondence between phone numbers and registration names e.g. holder names . The phonebook data may further indicate a correspondence between the phone numbers and other information items such as email addresses and birth dates. The outgoing call history data indicate a correspondence between destination phone numbers of outgoing calls and clock times of the outgoing calls which are concerned about an outgoing call from the DCM or an outgoing call from the BT compliant cellular phone with which the handsfree unit is under the HFP connection. The incoming call history data indicate a correspondence between source phone numbers of answered incoming calls and clock times of the answered incoming calls which are concerned about an answered incoming call to the DCM or an answered incoming call to the BT compliant cellular phone with which the handsfree unit is under the HFP connection. The missed incoming call history data indicate a correspondence between source phone numbers of missed incoming calls and clock times of the missed incoming calls which are concerned about a missed incoming call to the DCM or a missed incoming call to the BT compliant cellular phone with which the handsfree unit is under the HFP connection.

The display unit includes a display portion for displaying display windows on a screen and a touch manipulation input portion forming a touch switch on a display window or the screen. The display controller of the handsfree unit controls a display operation of the display portion of the display unit based on a display command signal which is received from the controller . The touch manipulation interface portion of the handsfree unit receives a manipulation detection signal via the touch manipulation input portion according to the user having manipulated the touch switch formed on the display window or screen and then outputs the received manipulation detection signal to the controller . The controller of the handsfree unit analyzes the received manipulation detection signal to thereby execute a predetermined process. The touch manipulation interface portion may be also referred to as a manipulation reception portion to receive a manipulation or an input manipulation of the user.

The DCM has a function to perform a communication operation via a communication network using the phone number allocated to the DCM itself. It is noted that the communication network includes facilities which provide known cellular phone communication services such as a wireless base station and a base station control apparatus. The DCM has a configuration to enable a voice call via the communication network using the handsfree unit . That is the DCM may be also referred to as an in vehicle phone which may be defined as being attached to the vehicle. Therefore the following calls the DCM as the in vehicle phone .

The following refers to the BT compliant cellular phone as a BT phone . The BT phone includes the following a controller to control an overall operation of the BT phone itself a phone communication portion to perform a voice call via the communication network a BT interface IF portion to perform a BT communication a key input portion arranging various keys which a user manipulates a storage portion a display portion to display various display windows a microphone to input a sound which the user utters and a speaker which outputs as a reception sound a sound received from a call partner. The storage portion has storage areas to contain phonebook data outgoing call history data incoming call history data and missed incoming history data.

The BT interface of the BT phone has a function to perform BT communications with the handsfree unit . The BT interface portion is compliant with HFP. In addition the BT interface is compliant with at least one of PBAP and OPP. That is the BT phone has a function to transmit phonebook data to the handsfree unit .

Thus the handsfree unit may be also referred to as a handsfree portion to achieve a handsfree call using the in vehicle phone and a handsfree call using the BT phone which may be referred to as an external or portable phone brought in the vehicle and brought out from the vehicle. Further the external or portable phone signifies a phone that is brought to or unattached to the vehicle and enabled to enter or exit the vehicle. In addition the BT interface portion may be also referred to as a communication portion to perform a communication with the BT phone as the external phone.

In contrast the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area can store phonebook data also referred to as second phonebook data corresponding to the in vehicle phone . The phone phonebook data or data set stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area may be used when using the in vehicle phone . Storing or storage i.e. writing of the phonebook data in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is executed by the controller . The storage may be executed in such a manner as to store phonebook data that are prepared or edited by a predetermined manipulation of a user or to transmit phonebook data i.e. the BT phone use phonebook data from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . It is noted that unless a use permission manipulation by the user is performed the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area or the copied phonebook data from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area are not transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area .

The controller may include a first phonebook management section that acquires phonebook data stored in the external BT phone via the BT interface portion and stores the acquired phonebook data in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . In addition the controller may include a second phonebook management section that makes a data copy of phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area and stores the data copy of the phonebook data in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . Thus the user can use the phonebook data that are stored in the above mentioned manner thereby the registration name may be selected without performing a direct entry of a phone number thereby enabling a quick and simply operation for an outgoing call to a communication partner.

The following will explain an operation related to a phonebook function i.e. a management method of phonebook data of the in vehicle apparatus with reference to to . First the following will explain a phonebook function in cases that a BT phone is a use target for a handsfree phone call. is a flowchart which illustrates a phonebook data transmission process executed mainly by the controller . to indicate display examples of display windows related with a phonebook function and illustrate display windows displayed in the display portion of the display unit and touch switches formed in the touch manipulation input portion of the display unit . When a user who holds a BT phone gets into the vehicle the connection is established between the handsfree unit and the BT phone . Then the user performs a predetermined manipulation thereby the BT phone held by the user is registered as a target use target for a handsfree phone communication or handsfree phone call in the handsfree unit . The phonebook data transmission process illustrated in is executed when the phonebook function of the BT phone is used under a state where the handsfree unit and the BT phone are connected after the above registration was completed.

The phonebook data transmission process in is executed in each of four patterns to depending on a storage state of phonebook data in the phonebook data storage area . The pattern is the case where any phonebook data does not exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area or the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . The pattern is the case where any phonebook data does not exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area and phonebook data exist in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . The pattern is the case where phonebook data does exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area and any phonebook data does not exist in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . The pattern is the case where phonebook data exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area and phonebook data exist in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area .

The characters which indicate a phone being presently a use target are displayed in the phone name display column . That is when the connected BT phone is presently a use target the model name OOO is displayed for instance. When the in vehicle phone is presently a use target the in vehicle phone is displayed. The phone number of the calling destination i.e. outgoing call destination is displayed in the calling destination display column . The key input portion includes the various keys that are arranged and is used when inputting a phone number of the calling destination or when preparing phonebook data in manual entries manually . P BOOK button is for using the phonebook function. CONNECT button is for changing the use phone between phones. The calling button is for starting a phone call to the phone number currently displayed in the calling destination display column . RETURN button is for returning the present display window to the previous display window that was displayed just before the present display window.

It is further noted that a flowchart or the processing of the flowchart in the present application includes sections also referred to as steps which are represented for instance as S. Further each section can be divided into several sub sections while several sections can be combined into a single section. Furthermore each of thus configured sections can be referred to as a device module or means and achieved not only i as a software section in combination with a hardware unit e.g. computer but also ii as a hardware section including or not including a function of a related apparatus. Further the hardware section may be inside of a microcomputer.

 P BOOK button is touched thereby the phonebook data transmission process illustrated in is started START . At S it is determined whether phonebook data exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area corresponding to the connected BT phone i.e. whether the BT phone use phonebook data storage area corresponding to the connected BT phone is empty. In this case any phonebook data do not exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . That is since the BT phone use phonebook data storage area is empty S YES the flow proceeds to S. At S a message is displayed which confirms with a user whether the phonebook data stored in the BT phone may be transmitted to the handsfree unit refer to b of . When NO is selected S NO the process is completed without transmitting the phonebook data END . When YES is selected S YES the flow proceeds to S.

At S the phonebook data is transmitted or copied from the BT phone to the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . In this case the display window is displayed which indicates that it is during the transmission of the phonebook data refer to c of . When the transmission of the phonebook data is completed the flow proceeds to S. At a message is displayed which confirms with the user whether the use of the phonebook data for the BT phone transmitted previously may be available also when using the in vehicle phone refer to d of . When YES is selected YES the flow proceeds to S.

At S a use flag which is mentioned later is set to 1 and the flow proceeds to S. At S it is determined whether phonebook data exist in the in vehicle phone phonebook data storage area . In the pattern any phonebook data do not exist in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . That is since the phonebook data are absent or the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is empty S YES the flow proceeds to S. At S the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area are transmitted i.e. copied to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . In contrast in the pattern phonebook data exist in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . That is the phonebook data are present or the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is not empty S NO the flow proceeds to S without executing S.

In contrast NO is selected in the display window of d of the flow proceeds to S. At S the use flag is set to 0 and the flow proceeds to S. At S a list of the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area is displayed refer to e of and the process is completed END . The displayed list contains registration names in the order of the Japanese syllabary for instance. When the BT phone is presently a use target the user only needs to select a desired registration name from the list by touch manipulation so as to perform a phone calling to the phone number associated with the registration name.

 P BOOK button is touched thereby the phonebook data transmission process illustrated in is started START . In this case phonebook data exist in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . That is the phonebook data are present or the BT phone use phonebook data storage area is not empty S NO the flow proceeds to S without executing S S. The process subsequent to S is the same as that of the pattern therefore any explanation is omitted.

 P BOOK button is touched thereby the phonebook data transmission process illustrated in is started START . In this case like the pattern the phonebook data are present S NO the flow proceeds to S without executing S S. The process subsequent to S is the same as that of the pattern therefore any explanation is omitted.

In the phonebook data transmission process illustrated in as long as the use flag is set to 1 the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area are transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area and used as the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone . That is a manipulation to set the use flag to 1 may be referred to as a use permission manipulation of permitting the use of the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . However although the use flag is set to 0 at the beginning it is assumed that the user may consider the change of the setup afterwards. To that end in the present embodiment the setup of the use flag may be changed as follows. It is noted that the following manipulation is only for changing the setup of the use flag and the following manipulation alone cannot enable the use of the phonebook data for BT phone as the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone . In order to actually enable the use of it another manipulation in the phonebook setup for the in vehicle phone is needed explained later .

When USE AS IN V P BOOK button is touched in b of a display window of c of is displayed. When YES is touched the use flag is set to 1. When NO is touched the use flag is set to 0. Then a displayed window returns to the window display of b of again. When COMPLETE button is touched a displayed window returns to the display window of a of under the state where the above change is completed. In contrast when RETURN button is touched a displayed window returns to the display window of a of under the state where the above change is cancelled. When INITIAL button is touched the setup of the use flag is returned to an initial state i.e. default value .

Further the following will explain a phonebook function in cases that the in vehicle phone is presently a use target of a handsfree phone call. Similar to to to illustrate display examples of display windows about the phonebook function. Like a of a of may be referred to as a top display window related to a handsfree function. When the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is empty in a state where the in vehicle phone is presently a use target touching P BOOK button enables the display of a setup display window relating to the phonebook of the in vehicle phone refer to b of . The setup display window e.g. a manipulation list in b of contains PREPARE P BOOK button EDIT P BOOK button and SET P BOOK USE button .

 PREPARE P BOOK button is used when newly preparing or registering phonebook data. When PREPARE P BOOK button is touched the phonebook preparation display window unshown is displayed. In this display window when a predetermined phonebook preparation manipulation is performed by the user phonebook data according to the manipulation is prepared. The prepared phonebook data are stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area .

Further EDIT P BOOK button is used when editing the phonebook data. When EDIT P BOOK button is touched a phonebook edit display window unshown is displayed. In this display window when a predetermined phonebook edit manipulation is performed by the user the phonebook data stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area are edited or changed according to the manipulation. The preparation editing and storage of the above phonebook data are executed mainly by the controller . Further the use of SET P BOOK USE button is mentioned later.

In contrast the following is based on the case that the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is not empty and phonebook data are stored therein in a state where the in vehicle phone is presently a use target. In this case when P BOOK button is touched a list of the phonebook data is displayed refer to e of . Such a list of the phonebook data indicates the phonebook data stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . That is the list contains the phonebook data transmitted from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area by the phonebook data transmission process and or the phonebook data prepared or edited by the user s input manipulation. When the in vehicle phone is presently a use target the user only needs to select a desired registration name from the list by touch manipulation so as to perform a phone calling to the phone number associated with the registration name.

Now the following is related to the case where the phonebook data for a BT phone is not transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area in the phonebook data set transmission process in . Even in this case the above transmission of the phonebook data can be possible by performing the following manipulation. However a use flag corresponding to at least one BT phone needs to be set to 1. illustrates transitions of display windows when transmitting the phonebook data set stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area .

In a is a setup display window related to the phonebook of the in vehicle phone and is equivalent to b of . Herein a of can be displayed by performing a predetermined manipulation from a menu window unshown . In images other than ones related with the transmission of the phonebook data are omitted. Herein when SET P BOOK USE button is touched a display window is displayed which selects the phonebook data for the BT phone used as phonebook data for the in vehicle phone refer to b of . It is noted that all the use flags may be set to 0 with respect to all the BT phones that are registered in the handsfree unit . In such a case the above mentioned SET P BOOK USE button is toned down i.e. invalidated and cannot be selected. In b of only the phonebook data only HF 1 HF 2 and HF 3 of the BT phones whose use flags are set to 1 are toned up or validated . In contrast the phonebook data HF 4 and HF 5 of the BT phones whose use flags are set to 0 are toned down or invalidated .

Herein as used in the above the phonebook data for a single BT phone may be referred to as a phonebook data set for the single BT phone similarly a plurality of phonebook data for a plurality of BT phones may be referred to as a plurality of phonebook data sets for the plurality of BT phones .

In b of predetermined phonebook data or a predetermined phonebook data set e.g. HF 2 may be selected or touched. In such a case when any phonebook data is not stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area the selected phonebook data set is transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . In contrast when the phonebook data are already stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area the confirmation regarding the transmission manners overwrite add or stop is made refer to c of .

Upon touching OVERWRITE button the transmitted phonebook data for the selected BT phone are stored as a substitute of the phonebook data stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . That is upon touching OVERWRITE button the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area comes to store only the phonebook data that are newly transmitted from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . Upon touching ADD button the transmitted phonebook data for the selected BT phone are stored to be added to the phonebook data previously stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . That is upon touching ADD button the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area comes to store both i the previously stored phonebook data and ii the phonebook data that are newly transmitted from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . Upon touching STOP button the phonebook data transmission process is stopped.

The following will explain a use restriction security function for phonebook data for the in vehicle phone stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . illustrates transitions of display windows when setting the use restriction function. A setup display window for setting the various restrictions relative to the in vehicle phone is displayed based on a predetermined manipulation from a menu window unshown refer to a of . Further a of contains an own phone number display column that displays the phone number of the in vehicle phone and a lock number display column that displays a password. Yet further a of contains setup windows to change the setups YES or NO of an auto answering refusal function an outgoing call restriction function and a phonebook restriction function. Other items unshown in a of may be displayed by manipulating a scroll bar on the right side.

The phonebook restriction function is to request an input of a password when using the phonebook data stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . The use of such a phonebook restriction function can prevent a third party or outsider from using the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone without permission thereby the security can be raised. The setup of the phonebook restriction function is as follows.

That is upon touching P BOOK RESTRICT button a display window in b of is displayed. In this case upon touching YES the phonebook restriction function becomes validated upon NO the phonebook restriction function becomes invalidated. Further Upon touching RETURN a display window of a of is displayed without changing the setup relative to the phonebook restriction function. Upon touching YES or NO an input of a password lock number is requested refer to c of . When the correct password is inputted and then COMPLETE button is touched a displayed window returns to the initial or first setup display window under the state where the setup of the phonebook restriction function is changed refer to d of . When the inputted password is incorrect a message indicating that the incorrect password input is displayed so as to urged to re input a password. That is unless the correct password is inputted the setup of the phonebook restriction function is not changed.

The above configuration can provide the following effects. When a BT phone is connected with the handsfree unit and selected as a use target the phonebook data or data set stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area corresponding to the connected BT phone can be used. In addition when the in vehicle phone is selected as a use target the phonebook data or data set stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area can be used. Therefore the user only needs to select an intended registration name of each phonebook data set with a touch manipulation so as to enable a phone calling to the phone number associated with the selected or intended registration name.

A use flag is attached to the phonebook data or phonebook data set stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . The phonebook data assigned with the use flag set to 1 is transmitted or copied in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area as the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone . Therefore the registration of the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone can be easily performed. There may be existing a plurality of phonebook data i.e. a plurality of phonebook data sets and the number of the plurality of phonebook data or data sets is many. Even in such a case the user is only required to perform the setup of the use flag attached to an intended phonebook data set thereby the data transmission or copy can be automatically executed in the in vehicle apparatus . Therefore the usability can be improved as compared with the case that the registration of the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone is made by a user s manipulation such as a manual entry of each phone number or related information items for instance.

As explained above unless the use flag is set to 1 the phonebook data for the corresponding BT phone is not transmitted or copied in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . The setup of the use flag relative to a BT phone is performed by a user who owns or has the BT phone . This configuration can prevent the phonebook data stored in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area i.e. the phonebook data stored in the BT phone from being used thoughtlessly thereby improving the security.

The setup of the use flag is performed when using the phonebook function for the first time after registering the BT phone . Further the setup of the use flag may be also changed thereafter Such a configuration can provide an advantage when the vehicle is shared by more than one user. That is a user can make the setup of the use flag so as to enable the use of the phonebook data corresponding to the BT phone held by the user as the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone when using the vehicle for instance. Alternatively a user can make the setup of the use flag so as to disable the use of the phonebook data corresponding to the BT phone held by the user as the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone for instance. Such a configuration can help prevent other users from using the phonebook data of the BT phone held by the user thereby improving the security.

In the phonebook data transmission process illustrated in the phonebook data for the BT phone whose use flag is set to 1 is transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . In this case the determination at S is provided to determine whether the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is empty. When it is empty S YES the transmission of the above phonebook data is executed. This configuration can prevent the already stored phonebook data in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area from being changed or erased carelessly because of automatically transmitting the phonebook data.

In the setup about the phonebook of the in vehicle phone when a BT phone whose use flag is set to 1 is under connection the phonebook data of the BT phone is transmitted to the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . In this case when the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is empty the phonebook data is transmitted directly. In contrast when the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is not empty the data transmission manner or method e.g. overwrite add is confirmed with a user. The user only needs to select overwrite or add when the phonebook data already stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is unnecessary or necessary respectively. Such a confirmation with a user can improve usability of the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone .

When the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is empty in a state where the in vehicle phone is presently a use target the phonebook function may be used. In this case a setup display window relative to the phonebook of the in vehicle phone appears refer to b of . The setup display window can be changed to a phonebook preparation display window for preparing a phonebook or a setup display window for enabling the transmission of the phonebook data from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . This configuration can urge a user to register phonebook data when the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone is empty.

In addition the transition can be made from the above setup display window to the phonebook editing display window for editing the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone . In this display window when a predetermined phonebook editing manipulation is performed by the user the phonebook data stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area is edited or changed according to the manipulation. The phonebook data in the BT phone use phonebook data storage area may be transmitted to and stored in the in vehicle phone use phonebook data storage area . Such a stored phonebook data is identical to the phonebook data for the BT phone but copied from the BT phone use phonebook data storage area . Therefore the editing of the phonebook data for the in vehicle phone can be made without affecting the original phonebook data for the BT phone . This can improve also usability.

The present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment described above and illustrated in the drawings and can be modified or expanded as follows for instance.
