title: Low collateral damage fragmentation warhead
abstract: A fragmentation warhead includes a cylindrical body, and an explosive charge disposed within the innermost part of the warhead body comprised of slidable positionable explosives, their times of detonation controllable by an operator. The apparatus can produce numbers and sizes of fragments ranging from relatively large to relatively small.

This application is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 12 729 485 filed Mar. 23 2010 now abandoned the entire file wrapper contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.

The inventions described herein may be made used or licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Warhead fragmentation effectiveness is determined by the number mass shape and velocity of the warhead s fragments. By using a controlled fragmentation design warhead fragmentation can generally be achieved quickly and in a cost effective manner. Exemplary controlled fragmentation techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 491 694 4 312 274 4 745 864 5 131 329 and 5 337 673.

Conventional designs in general use cutter liners that form fragments by generating a complex pattern of high velocity penetrators for fragmenting the shell. Although these conventional fragmentation designs have proven to be useful it would be desirable to present additional functional cost and safety improvements that minimize the warhead weight reduce manufacture expenses and are less sensitive to unintended explosions. Explosive type fragmentation devices may be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4 823 701 to Earl E. Wilhelm in U.S. Pat. No. 3 970 005 to Mathew Rothman and in U.S. Pat. No. 3 954 060 to Haag et al the entire file wrapper contents of which patents are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth.

What is needed in this field is an inexpensive warhead which in addition provides the user an ability to select in advance the degree of fragmentation and sizes of fragmentation for particular targets. According to one embodiment of the present invention a warhead includes a liner that is disposed inside the warhead body filled with the warhead s explosive such allowing the detonation shock wave to directly propagate into the fragments. As a result the explosion produces a complex pattern of shear planes in the warhead body causing shell break up and release of fragments with predetermined sizes. This design is distinguishable from existing fragmentation liner technologies that attempt to score or cut the warhead body. One of the advantages of the present embodiment compared to existing technologies is the cost effectiveness of the manufacturing process of the present design in that it is faster and more economical to fabricate as opposed to notching or cutting a steel warhead body itself.

The present invention satisfies these needs and presents a munition or warhead as part of a projectile and an associated method for generating diverse fragmentation patterns. The invention relates to explosive fragmentation ammunition with target adaptable fragmentation output and more particularly to a warhead having means for selectively controlling the number of fragments that range from the full to the lower lethality level. According to an embodiment of the invention the target adaptable fragmentation output is achieved by means of a dual purpose explosive propellant charge that ejects a main high explosive charge from a fragmentation case thus changing the extent of the contact area between the explosive charge and the case and consequently the degree of case fragmentation. This provides a user with an ability to select in advance the degree of fragmentation and sizes of fragmentation for particular targets.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a fragmentation warhead where relative fragment quantity and fragment sizes can be selected by the user and 

It is another object of the present invention to provide a fragmentation warhead utilizing propellant which directs relative sliding of a high explosive through a fragmentation case in the warhead to affect relative fragment quantities released from such warhead and 

It is a still further object of the invention to provide a fragmentation warhead utilizing dual propellant high explosive to affect fragmentation of a fragmentation case in a warhead for producing a relative fragment quantity.

These and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention and in light of the following drawings. It should be understood that the sizes and shapes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown here for visual clarity and for purpose of explanation.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
