title: Utilizing a secondary application to render invitational content in a separate window above an allocated space of primary content
abstract: Methods and arrangements are provided for utilizing a secondary application to render invitational content. Primary content rendered by a web browser can be embedded with a command requesting that a secondary application be executed. The secondary application can be executed in a secured sand box environment and configured to render invitational content in a second window above the primary content. The secondary application can be known and trusted by the operating system to gather sensitive data used to select appropriate invitational content. Further, data can be included in the command requesting that the secondary application be executed. The invitational content can be associated with secondary views that can be rendered without affecting the primary content. The secondary application can collect data to render the secondary view, such as the exact point selected, which is used to render graphical transition effects leading to the secondary view.

The present disclosure relates to invitational content and more specifically to rendering invitational content with a secondary application.

Mobile devices have unlocked great potential for advertisers to see greater return on their investment. Mobile devices are such an important part of a user s life that they can collect very detailed information about the user that can in turn be used by an advertising server to effectively target advertisements to users that will be interested in those advertisements.

While targeting advertisements that are of interest to a user ultimately provides a benefit to both the user and the advertiser the information potentially collected by a mobile device and shared and utilized by an adverting server can be highly sensitive. Accordingly if a mobile device operating system is going to have access to such sensitive data or collect such sensitive data it must do so in accordance with a published privacy policy.

Due to the sensitive nature of the information involved there is a continuing need to develop mechanisms to protect a user s private information while still effectively targeting advertisements to the user.

A further problem with advertising on mobile devices is that given the small interfaces of these devices the user interfaces of these devices must be highly refined to provide a good user experience. Unlike advertisements presented on more conventional computers with larger workspaces user interfaces and input devices which can afford to navigate a user away from a viewed web page or open a pop up window such actions cannot be tolerated in the mobile environment due to the resulting inconvenience to the user to have to navigate back to the originally viewed content after they are done interacting with the advertisement. Accordingly there is a need for a refined user interface and user experience for displaying advertisements within web pages on a mobile device.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.

Disclosed are systems devices methods and non transitory computer readable storage media for utilizing a secondary application to render invitational content. A web browser application can request primary content such as a webpage from a primary content provider. The requested primary content can be delivered as code that can be rendered by the web browser application to display the webpage in a first window. The primary content can also include code requesting that a secondary application be executed within the web browser application. For example the secondary application can be configured to render invitational content in a second window view or layer above the primary content in the web browser. In some embodiments the code to execute the secondary application can be an object tag associated with a special non standard MIME type. Upon rendering such code the web browser can send a command to the operating system to execute the secondary application. The secondary application can be an application known and trusted by the operating system and thus configured to communicate with the operating system to request and receive sensitive information. To maintain the security of the sensitive information the operating system can execute the secondary application in a secured sand box environment thus protecting the information from other untrusted and less secure applications such as the web browser.

The secondary application can be configured to request invitational content from an invitational content provider or content delivery system and render the received invitational content in a second window over the primary content. The primary content and the invitational content are thus rendered in two separate windows and by two separate threads while visually appearing to be rendered as one.

The secondary application can send data to the invitational content provider or content delivery system used to select appropriate invitational content. In some embodiments the data can be included as part of the command requesting that the secondary application be executed. In some embodiments the secondary application can harvest the data. For example because the secondary application is a trusted application the secondary application can communicate with the operating system to harvest sensitive data regarding the user and the user terminal. Further the sand boxed secondary application protects the sensitive data from other less secure applications only sharing it with a trusted invitational content provider or content delivery system.

The secondary application can be configured to render the invitational content above an allocated space in the primary content so that the invitational content does not interfere with the primary content. In some embodiments the invitational content can be associated with secondary views different than the initial view. For example invitational content such as a banner ad can be configured to navigate a user to further information concerning the advertised product upon selection by the user. Because the invitational content is rendered in a second application secondary views can be rendered without affecting the primary content rendered in the web browser application below. Further the secondary application can be configured to collect data used to properly render the secondary view. For example the secondary application can gather data at the moment the invitational content is selected such as the exact point the user selected which can be used to render graphical transition effects leading to the secondary view.

Various embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. A basic input output BIOS stored in ROM or the like may provide the basic routine that helps to transfer information between elements within the computing device such as during start up. The computing device further includes storage devices such as a hard disk drive a magnetic disk drive an optical disk drive tape drive or the like. The storage device can include software modules for controlling the processor . Other hardware or software modules are contemplated. The storage device is connected to the system bus by a drive interface. The drives and the associated computer readable storage media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions data structures program modules and other data for the computing device . In one aspect a hardware module that performs a particular function includes the software component stored in a non transitory computer readable medium in connection with the necessary hardware components such as the processor bus output device and so forth to carry out the function. The basic components are known to those of skill in the art and appropriate variations are contemplated depending on the type of device such as whether the device is a small handheld computing device a desktop computer or a computer server.

Although the exemplary embodiment described herein employs the storage device it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that are accessible by a computer such as magnetic cassettes flash memory cards digital versatile disks cartridges random access memories RAMs read only memory ROM a cable or wireless signal containing a bit stream and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment. Non transitory computer readable storage media expressly exclude media such as energy carrier signals electromagnetic waves and signals per se.

To enable user interaction with the computing device an input device represents any number of input mechanisms such as a microphone for speech a touch sensitive screen for gesture or graphical input keyboard mouse motion input speech and so forth. An output device can also be one or more of a number of output mechanisms known to those of skill in the art. In some instances multimodal systems enable a user to provide multiple types of input to communicate with the computing device . The communications interface generally governs and manages the user input and system output. There is no restriction on operating on any particular hardware arrangement and therefore the basic features here may easily be substituted for improved hardware or firmware arrangements as they are developed.

For clarity of explanation the illustrative system embodiment is presented as including individual functional blocks including functional blocks labeled as a processor or processor . The functions these blocks represent may be provided through the use of either shared or dedicated hardware including but not limited to hardware capable of executing software and hardware such as a processor that is purpose built to operate as an equivalent to software executing on a general purpose processor. For example the functions of one or more processors presented in may be provided by a single shared processor or multiple processors. Use of the term processor should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software. Illustrative embodiments may include microprocessor and or digital signal processor DSP hardware read only memory ROM for storing software performing the operations discussed below and random access memory RAM for storing results. Very large scale integration VLSI hardware embodiments as well as custom VLSI circuitry in combination with a general purpose DSP circuit may also be provided.

The logical operations of the various embodiments are implemented as 1 a sequence of computer implemented steps operations or procedures running on a programmable circuit within a general use computer 2 a sequence of computer implemented steps operations or procedures running on a specific use programmable circuit and or 3 interconnected machine modules or program engines within the programmable circuits. The system shown in can practice all or part of the recited methods can be a part of the recited systems and or can operate according to instructions in the recited non transitory computer readable storage media. Such logical operations can be implemented as modules configured to control the processor to perform particular functions according to the programming of the module. For example illustrates three modules Mod Mod and Mod which are modules configured to control the processor . These modules may be stored on the storage device and loaded into RAM or memory at runtime or may be stored as would be known in the art in other computer readable memory locations.

Having disclosed some components of a computing system the disclosure now turns to which illustrates an exemplary system configuration wherein electronic devices communicate via a network for purposes of exchanging content and other data. The system can be configured for use on a network as that illustrated in . However the present principles are applicable to a wide variety of network configurations that facilitate the intercommunication of electronic devices. For example each of the components of system in can be implemented in a localized or distributed fashion in a network.

In system invitational content is delivered to user terminals . . . collectively connected to a communication network by direct and or indirect communications with a content delivery system . In particular the content delivery system receives a request for a content package of electronic invitational content such as a web page an application a game or media etc. from one of user terminals . In the various embodiments one or more types of invitational content can be combined in a content package. The user terminal can be configured to render the received invitational content. This can include display or playing the invitational content appropriately depending on the form of the invitational content. For example the invitational content can include text graphics audio video executable code or any combination thereof.

Upon successfully rendering the delivered invitational content the user terminal can be configured to send a notification to the content delivery system . In some embodiments the notification can be a web beacon such as an embedded tracking pixel. In some embodiments the operating system of the user terminal is configured to report rendering of the invitational content. In some embodiments the notification can be cryptographically secured by means such as authentication and digests.

In some embodiments the invitational content can be associated with a product or can directly or indirectly advertise a product. In some embodiments the content package can be configured to replace or update invitational content in a content package already delivered to the user terminal.

Further the invitational content can be active invitational content. That is invitational content that is designed to primarily elicit a pre defined response from the user. For example active invitational content can include one or more types of advertisements configured to be clicked upon solicit information or be converted by the user into a further action such as a purchase or download of the advertised item. In some embodiments active invitational content can include secondary views that can be presented to a user upon selection of an initial view of the invitational content. For example the initial view can be a banner advertisement that when selected directs the user to a secondary view such as a multimedia advertisement.

However invitational content can also include passive invitational content. That is invitational content that is designed to primarily inform the user. In some cases passive invitational content can include information that can lead or direct users to active invitational content. Additionally the invitational content can be dynamic invitational content. That is invitational content that varies over time or that varies based on user interaction with the invitational content. However the various embodiments are not limited in this regard and the invitational content can be static invitational content that does not vary over time or that varies based on user interaction. In the various embodiments an invitational content in a content package can be static or dynamic and active or passive. Further various types of invitational content can be combined in a same content package.

After receiving the request for invitational content the content delivery system selects the invitational content in response to the request and transmits the assembled invitational content to the requesting one of user terminals . In some embodiments the server has preselected the invitational content before the request is received. Thereafter the server assembles a content package of invitational content and causes the content package to be delivered to the user. The content delivery system can include a communications interface to facilitate communications with the user terminals and any other components familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The content delivery system includes a content management module that facilitates generation of the assembled content package which can include invitational content. Specifically the content management module can combine content from one or more primary content providers . . . collectively and content from one or more invitational content providers . . . collectively to generate the assembled content package for the user terminals . For example in the case of a web page being delivered to a requesting one of user terminals the content management module can assemble a content package by requesting the data for the web page from one of the primary content providers maintaining the web page. For the invitational content on the web page provided by the invitational content providers the content management module can request the appropriate data according to the arrangement between the primary and invitational content providers and . In some embodiments device can directly request or already have access to primary content from primary content provider . In such embodiments device can further request invitational content from system . System can identify and deliver invitational content appropriate for association with primary content. For example primary content such as an application can already reside or be running of a device and primary content can direct device to request invitational content from system to be associated with primary content on device .

Although primary and invitational content providers and are presented herein as separate entities this is for illustrative purposes only. In some cases the primary and invitational content providers and can be the same entity. Thus a single entity can define and provide both the primary and the invitational content.

Although the content management module can be configured to request that content be sent directly from content providers and a cached arrangement can also be used to improve performance of the content delivery system and improve overall user experience. That is the content delivery system can include a content database for locally storing caching content maintained by content providers and . The data in the content database can be refreshed or updated on a regular basis to ensure that the content in the database is up to date at the time of a request from a user terminal. However in some cases the content management module can be configured to retrieve content directly from content providers and if the metadata associated with the data in content database appears to be outdated or corrupted.

In some embodiments the primary and invitational content can be assembled by the user terminal . For example the primary content and invitational content can be delivered to the user terminal and assembled at the user terminal based on assembly rules dictating how to properly assemble the primary and invitational content together. In some embodiments the assembly rules can be delivered to the user terminal by the content delivery system .

In the various embodiments the content delivery system can also include a unique user identifier UUID database that can be used for managing sessions with the various user terminal devices . The UUID database can be used with a variety of session management techniques. For example the content delivery system can implement an HTTP cookie or any other conventional session management method e.g. IP address tracking URL query strings hidden form fields window name tracking authentication methods and local shared objects for user terminals connected to content delivery system via a substantially persistent network session. However other methods can be used as well. For example in the case of handheld communications devices such as mobile phones smart phones tablets or other types of user terminals connecting using multiple or non persistent network sessions multiple requests for content from such devices may be assigned to a same entry in the UUID database . The delivery system can analyze the attributes of requesting devices to determine whether such requests can be attributed to the same user. Such attributes can include device or group specific attributes.

The web browser can be configured to allow a secondary application to access predetermined functionality of the web browser so that the secondary application can run seamlessly with the web browser. For example the web browser can provide this functionality as an Application Programming Interface API that defines functions of the web browser that can be used by the secondary application . The API allows a secondary application such as a plug in application to be configured to execute with the web browser and appear as one program although the two run separately. For example in some embodiments the secondary application can be configured to request and render invitational content the invitational content can be rendered by a separate thread than the primary content and in a separate window above the primary content while appearing to be one rendered image. The term window is used as one example and is not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art would recognize that the invitational content can be rendered in any number of ways such as in a separate hosted view or layer above the primary content.

To use the secondary application to request and render invitational content a primary content provider can include an object tag embedded within the primary content which when processed by the web browser sends a request to the operating system to execute the secondary application . In some embodiments the object tag can be associated with a special non standard MIME type that is recognized by the web browser to request execution of the secondary application .

When executed the secondary application can be configured to request and retrieve invitational content from an invitational content server or content delivery system and render the content in a separate window above the primary content. The secondary application can be an application known and trusted by the operating system and thus given permission to communicate with the operating system to harvest sensitive data that should not be shared with third party applications. An application can be deemed trusted by being certified by the developer of the operating system. For example the developer of the secondary application can design the secondary application based on guidelines set by the developer of the operating system and the secondary application can be reviewed by the developer of the operating system to ensure that the guidelines have been met. In some embodiments the developer of the operating system can also be the developer of the secondary application and thus have developed the secondary application according to their guidelines. Once certified the secondary application can include a token that can be passed to the operating system to signify that it has been certified as a trusted application. In some embodiments the operating system can reference a list of all applications certified as trusted.

The operating system can launch the secondary application in a secure sand boxed environment that limits third party application access to the secondary application and thus further protects the sensitive data shared with the secondary application . The secondary application can be configured to only share the sensitive data with a trusted invitational content provider or content delivery system.

To ensure that the invitational content does not interfere with the primary content the primary content can be configured to allocate a portion of the primary content to display the invitational content. The allocated portion can be left blank or include a default image or text. illustrates an exemplary screenshot of primary content displayed by a web browser. As illustrated a portion of the screen can be allocated to display the invitational content. A primary content provider can provide for this allocated space in the code for the primary content and include an object tag which causes the operating system to create and instance of the secondary application to manage the display of invitational content over the allocated space . It is important to note that the invitational content is not actually rendered within the allocated space in the same window but rather in a second window placed above the allocated space to create the illusion that the primary and invitational content are rendered as one page.

To further ensure that the invitational content does not interfere with the primary content in some embodiments the invitational content and allocated space can be one of a predefined set of standard sizes agreed upon by the primary and invitational content providers. To add more flexibility in some embodiments properties of the allocated space can be used by the secondary application to ensure that the invitational content is properly rendered within the allocated space. For example properties of the allocated space can include the dimensions of the allocated space. These properties can be used by the secondary application to request appropriately sized invitational content from the invitational content provider or content delivery system. For example the secondary application can include the dimensions of the allocated space in the request sent to the content delivery system. The content delivery system can then return appropriately sized invitational content based on the received dimensions. In some embodiments the secondary application can use the properties to scale the invitational content to fit within the allocated space.

In some embodiments the properties can dictate that a specific type or variant of invitational content be selected. For example the properties can dictate that the invitational content be limited to a certain form such as only text or not containing video. This may be because of limitations of the user terminal or setting chosen by the user. Properties specifying the proper type can be used to select an appropriate item of invitational content. In some embodiments an item of invitational content may be offered in various variants such as a text only version or a video version and the properties can thus be used to select the proper variant of the invitational content.

In some embodiments the properties of the allocated space can be passed to the secondary application as part of the object tag which requests that the secondary application be executed. In some embodiments the secondary application can be configured to harvest data from the web browser to determine the properties. In some embodiments the properties can be received as a combination of data passed by the object tag and data harvested by the secondary application.

In some embodiments a primary content provider can configure the primary content to use the secondary application to replace existing embedded content. For example invitational content embedded within primary content might not always be compatible or optimal to be performed with the user terminal or operating system. The primary content can be configured to check the user agent of the web browser to determine the type of user terminal and the operating system to make a determination on whether to render the embedded invitational content or request that a secondary application be executed to render invitational content replacing the embedded invitational content. The location of the embedded invitational content can then be used by the secondary application as an allocated space to render the replacement invitational content. For example the dimensions and location of the embedded invitational can be passed to the secondary application by the web browser and used as properties to request and render the invitational content. The secondary application can then render the invitational in a second window over the area where the embedded invitational content would have been rendered thus replacing it.

One advantage of utilizing a secondary application to render invitational content is that the primary content and the invitational content are not rendered by the same process or in the same window. This allows the invitational content to be configured to initiate secondary views without a user being navigated away from the primary content. When invitational content is embedded within the primary content and thus rendered by the web browser in the same window as the primary content selection of the invitational content to bring up a secondary view requires changing both the primary and invitational content because the two are rendered as one process and in one window. By using a secondary application that renders the invitational content in a second window that is displayed over the primary content secondary views of the invitational content can be rendered in the second window without affecting the window that the primary content is rendered in. Use of the secondary application thus results in the user being able to request and view additional invitational content while not navigating away from the primary content.

While in this example the secondary view expands and requires a user s interaction to be initiated this is only one possible embodiment. In some embodiments the secondary view can be the same size or even smaller than the initial view. In some embodiments user interaction is not required to initiate a secondary view of the invitational content. For example the secondary application can be configured to rotate the invitational content that is rendered based on time without any interaction by the user. Further although the term secondary view is used the number of secondary views is not limited to two. There can be any number of secondary views.

In some embodiments the secondary application can be configured to render the invitational content in a dynamic view. For example the invitational content can be rendered to allow a user to scroll through multiple items of invitational and then select the item they wish to view. In some embodiments the secondary application can be configured to display a static cover view representing each item of invitational content and render multiple cover views each representing a different item of invitational content such that they can be scrolled through by the user. The user can thus learn what items of invitational content are available and select an item of invitational content which they wish to view.

Upon receiving the request the primary content provider can transmit the requested content back to the user terminal via the communication network. Once received by the user terminal the primary content can be rendered by the web browser to be displayed on the user terminal. For example the primary content can be code such as HTML or JavaScript which can be processed by the web browser to render the requested content on the user terminal.

If the code being rendered by the web browser includes a command that a secondary application be executed then the web browser sends a request to the operating system that the secondary application be executed . For example the command can be in the form of an object tag requesting that an instance of a secondary application be created. In some embodiments the object tag can be associated with a special non standard MIME type that instructs the web browser to look for a secondary application to manage display of a specified area. If at block there is no command requesting that a secondary application be executed the method ends.

Once executed the secondary application can be configured to request invitational content from an invitational content provider or content delivery system in network communication with the user terminal. In some embodiments the request can include data which can be used by the invitational content provider or content delivery system in selecting invitational content to be returned to the user terminal.

For example the secondary application also can have access to and be configured to harvest data to be used in determining which invitational content to render. This data can be collected from the web browser and the operating system.

In some embodiments the secondary application can receive some data directly from the web browser. For example the object tag can include data specifying invitational content that can fit allocated spaces of specified dimensions. The data in the object tag can also specify that the invitational content meet other specifications e.g. specifications such as content type sports retail educational etc. target demographic information etc.

Additionally the secondary application can poll the operating system for additional data. The secondary application can be a known and trusted application to the operating system and thus given permission to harvest sensitive data from the operating system. Further the secondary application can be executed in a secure sand boxed environment that limits access from third party applications. Accordingly the secondary application can be trusted to securely gather sensitive information and protect the sensitive date from less secure third party applications. Since the secondary application is a secondary process that can communicate with the operating system it has access to a variety of data that can be used to determine the optimum invitational content to display to a user. This data can include user preferences such as configuration preferences it can also include data identifying specific applications installed or running on the device or more general information about the applications identifying applications by broad category it can include information identifying the web browser requesting the targeted application it can include past internet search terms topics extracted from electronic communications it can include network information such as network state roaming information type of connection such as 3 G 2 G Wi Fi connection speeds etc. and carrier information it can include general user information such as country of residence home zip code phone number area code language preferences keyboard configuration and parental restrictions it can include device information such as screen dimensions screen resolution hardware capabilities a device ID etc. it can include data extracted from a social network profile for example what groups or applications the user is a member of etc. or from an online store profile and it can include other targeting data.

The secondary process can also have access to various hardware components of the device and can access targeting data such as GPS locations. While some examples of data are listed above they should not be considered limiting but rather exemplary for the purposes of providing a fuller explanation of the present technology.

User protection and privacy is a primary concern and one of the many benefits of the present technology is the protection of the user s sensitive information while gaining the benefit of using the data to determine the optimum invitational content to display to a specific user. Because the secondary application is run separate from the web browser the data can be gathered and kept separate from the web browser. Further the secondary application can be configured to not share any identifying information. The user s identity is separate from the data used in selecting the invitational content and not shared thus keeping the user associated with the data anonymous. In some embodiments the private information never leaves the user terminal. For example the content delivery system can deliver rules to the user terminal which are used along with the private information to select an appropriate item of invitational content. The content delivery system can then assemble the primary and invitational content based on the delivered rules.

As described above one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of data available from various sources to improve the delivery of advertisements or any other content that may be of interest to users. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data location based data telephone numbers email addresses twitter ID s home addresses or any other identifying information.

The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data in the present technology can be used to the benefit of users. For example the personal information data can be used to better understand user behavior facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements applications and delivered content. Accordingly use of such personal information data enables calculated control of the delivered content. For example the system can reduce the number of times a user receives a given ad or other content and can thereby select and deliver content that is more meaningful to users. Such changes in system behavior improve the user experience. Further other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure.

The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection analysis disclosure transfer storage or other use of such personal information data should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. For example personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further such collection should occur only after the informed consent of the users. Additionally such entities would take any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy and security policies and procedures. Further such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices.

Despite the foregoing the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of or access to personal information data. That is the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example in the case of advertisement delivery services the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to opt in or opt out of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services. In another example users can select not to provide location information for advertisement delivery services. In yet another example users can configure their devices or user terminals to prevent storage or use of cookies and other mechanisms from which personal information data can be discerned. The present disclosure also contemplates that other methods or technologies may exist for blocking access to their personal information data.

Therefore although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user other non personal information available to the content delivery services or publically available information.

After the secondary application sends a request for invitational content the returned invitational content can then be rendered over the primary content rendered by the web browser. The secondary application can run as a separate thread than the web browser while executing within the web browser as a result the secondary application can be configured to render invitational content in a second window that is above the primary content. This can create the illusion that the primary and invitational content are being rendered within the same window while they are actually running in two separate windows.

One advantage of the present invention is that the primary and invitational content can run independently of each other and in separate windows and thus actions performed on one do not necessarily affect the other. For example the invitational content can be configured to present the user with secondary views upon selection and the secondary views can be rendered in the second window without having an effect on the primary content rendered below.

In some embodiments the secondary application can be configured to gather data that is used by the secondary application to render secondary views of the invitational content. For example the secondary application can gather data to create a graphical transition between an initial and secondary view of the invitational content. An initial view of the invitational content can be a static image such as a banner advertisement that when selected leads to a secondary view. The secondary application can be configured to gather data upon selection of the initial view that can be used as parameters to properly render a graphical transition between the two views. For example in some embodiments the exact point of selection can be gathered by the secondary application and used to create a transition effect originating from that point. For example the initial view can split open from the point of selection to reveal the second view that appears to be underneath.

In some embodiments the data collected to render the secondary view can include a screenshot at the moment the invitational content is selected. The screenshot can be rendered in the second window above the primary content to create the illusion that a graphical transition is affecting the entire screen while it is actually only taking place in the second window rendered above the primary content.

Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure may also include tangible and or non transitory computer readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such non transitory computer readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer including the functional design of any special purpose processor as discussed above. By way of example and not limitation such non transitory computer readable media can include RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions data structures or processor chip design. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection either hardwired wireless or combination thereof to a computer the computer properly views the connection as a computer readable medium. Thus any such connection is properly termed a computer readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer readable media.
