No. 8 302 590 is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 255 778 filed Oct. 21 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 061 343 issued Nov. 22 2011 and entitled Controllable Launcher U.S. Pat. No. 8 061 343 claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 620 804 filed Oct. 21 2004 all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Certain aspects of this invention were developed with U.S. Government support under Contract Nos. HR0011 04 C 0056 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and or W911NF 05 9 0003 awarded by the U.S. Army RDECOM . The Government may have certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to the field of launchers and more particularly to controllable launchers that propel payloads to a desired height.

There are many existing devices for launching payloads. Launching as used herein and in any appended claims refers to increasing the gravitational potential energy associated with a payload. Some devices for launching humans as well as objects into the air are mainly for amusement purposes. Circuses have amused crowds by shooting performers out of cannons. For recreational enjoyment certain traditional devices for launching subjects catapult subjects to experience a free fall sensation similar to the sensation of bungee jumping or skydiving. Aircraft ejection seat technology and aircraft carrier launching systems such as catapults are also capable of launching payloads however most of these designs have unpredictable and uncontrollable trajectories and or cannot be immediately reset and reused.

One circus type launcher uses a tetrahedral frame with elastic cords attached to the frame and a cradle for holding a person. The cradle is retracted from a rest position to a launch position causing tension in the elastic cords. Upon release the cradle is launched based on the tension of the elastic cords. Some of the drawbacks of these designs are the load is not guided along a particular path and the tetrahedral frame limits the trajectory angle to about 30 degrees.

Another traditional design uses bow shaped poles that crisscross and a trampoline mat located at the crossing point. In this launcher the subject to be launched is placed in a hollow airtight enclosure. The subject is launched at a trajectory angle around 45 degrees. A drawback of this design is it does not provide head or neck support. Alternatively the subject may be placed inside a hollow airtight ball. However subjects may find the extra steps of getting into and out of the ball inconvenient.

What is therefore needed is a launcher that is controllable and able to launch payloads through a repeatable and predictable trajectory. Furthermore the launcher should have a substantially short recycle time thus a user can launch another payload in a relatively short time after the previous launch.

We provide a controllable launching device that can launch a payload safely and with accuracy through a predictable trajectory onto a tall structure such as a building. This device is capable of launching a subject substantially vertically from the ground onto the roof of a building. Following a launch the launcher may advantageously be recycled in a short time in preparation for a subsequent launch.

The controllable launcher includes a base guide rail assembly a carriage for carrying a payload and an energy source to propel the carriage. The invention may further include other components such as an alignment device to align the launcher with an edge of a structure a horizontal measuring device to calculate the distance between the structure and launcher a calculator to determine the required energy to launch a payload to a desired height and leveling features to level the launcher. Furthermore stabilizing mechanisms may be added to the base and or guide rail assembly to keep the launcher statically stable during the launch process.

The invention may include a calculator to determine the proper energy required to launch a payload to a desired height based on the weight of the payload. Preferably such a calculation may be automated and thus performed by a microprocessor. When the payload is a human head and spine injuries are less likely since the acceleration forces act parallel to a person s spine.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the launcher may comprise a counterbalancing system. In this counterbalancing system the carriage and the piston components which may be substantially equal in weight may be connected in a closed loop connection. Based on the weight distribution and the closed loop connection the carriage and the piston components move comparable distances to one another in substantially opposite directions.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the launcher may comprise a deceleration mechanism to minimize excessive movements of the launcher during or after the launch of a payload. The deceleration mechanism based on the counterbalancing system may decelerate the carriage and the piston such that other components of the launcher may not move excessively during or after the launch of a payload.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the launcher may comprise supplemental payload propulsion devices. In this embodiment the supplemental payload propulsion device may be coupled to the carriage to further propel the payload during the launch. Additionally such a device may be used to produce a deceleration force to decelerate the carriage after launch. In an embodiment where the supplemental payload propulsion device produces a deceleration force the launcher may not include certain components of the deceleration system that may be redundant.

In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention the launch process of the launcher may be automated. In this embodiment automated devices using system feed back controls may align the launcher calculate the energy required to launch the payload to the desired height and control the appropriate valves to launch the payload.

In accordance with further yet another embodiment of the invention the launcher is portable quickly recharged for reuse and has a relatively short recycle time and may use a plurality of energy sources to propel the payload.

Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention various examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein the numerals indicate corresponding elements throughout the views.

As shown in the controllable launcher comprises a base a guide rail assembly a carriage and an energy source . The launcher may further comprise leveling features to level the launcher alignment devices to align the launcher with a structure and a calculator to calculate the required energy or pressure needed to reach a desired trajectory. Structurally the base supports and stabilizes the guide rail assembly . On certain uneven surfaces the base may be anchored to further support or stabilize the guide rail assembly . The carriage is coupled to the guide rail assembly such that the carriage can move along the guide rail A. An energy source coupled to the base and guide rail assembly provides the energy to propel the carriage and thus launch a payload . As used herein the term payload may be a human equipment or any object.

Turning now to the components of the launcher as shown in the base positions the controllable launcher relative to a surface. The base may have positioning devices such as support posts to enable it to be positioned on a surface and to provide static stability to the launcher. Still referring to the support posts may be adjustable posts with holes such as jacks thus a user may use spikes to anchor the base to a surface. Alternatively the positioning devices may include strings to enable the base to be secured to a surface. Additionally the base may include leveling devices to level the base on a surface and to ensure the proper trajectory. The leveling devices may be adjustable supports with levels . In one embodiment there are four leveling supports. In this embodiment the leveling supports anchor the launcher to the surface under the forces of the launcher and thus ensure that the launch platform is statically stable. Preferably the anchoring devices include leveling devices such as adjustable anchoring supports with levels.

The base is constructed from materials that provide strength but are lightweight to provide sufficient structural integrity to keep the launcher and the associated mechanisms statically stable during the launch process. Steel is an example of a suitable material. Furthermore the base may include devices to enable it to be portable and or mobile.

The guide rail assembly as shown in FIGS. and A B is coupled to and supported by the base . The guide rail assembly may comprise a cylinder guide rail pulleys A and an energy source feed tube . Cylinder may be referred to herein without limiting intent as a rodless cylinder in that in preferred embodiments a piston translates within the cylinder and is not coupled by means of any rod extending beyond the confines of the cylinder. In preferred embodiments of the invention the exterior A of the rodless cylinder serves as a guide rail for guiding the carriage during the launch. The length of the guide rail may be sized based on a preferred acceleration of the carriage. In embodiments where acceleration occurs over the entire length of the guide rail and where the carriage is used to launch human subjects the length of the guide rails A may be sized to allow the carriage accelerations to stay within the guidelines established by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency NASA . In one embodiment the guide rails A are 12 feet long to limit the acceleration of the carriage to approximately about 5 Gs for a 50 foot high trajectory.

In another embodiment the rodless cylinder may be a pneumatic cylinder. Here the cylinder contains a piston that is attached to the carriage with a cable . The cable connecting the piston and the carriage connect over the top guide rail pulley and under lower pulley A to form a closed loop. This closed loop connection is part of the counterbalancing system. Accordingly when the piston travels downward the carriage is propelled upward. In other words the connection is such that when the piston travels downward from its starting position as shown in the and B the carriage is pulled upward by the cable . The specific configuration of the closed loop connection is a cable connected to the piston is routed through a seal at the top end of the cylinder over a top pulley and then connects to the top of the carriage a second cable A connected to the base of the piston is routed down through the bottom of the cylinder around a bottom pulley A and then up to the top of the carriage .

The guide rail assembly may further comprise alignment devices . The alignment devices may be rigidly attached to the guide rail assembly . As shown in the alignment devices may include an alignment scope A and a horizontal distance calculator B. The alignment scope A may be used to sight the leading edge of the structure above which the payload is to be launched. Similarly the horizontal distance calculator B may be used to calculate the minimum horizontal distance from a structure onto which the payload is to be launched. Preferably the alignment devices are coupled to the guide rail assembly . Alternatively other components of the alignment devices may be coupled to other parts of the launcher.

The carriage as shown in can carry the payload for launch. The carriage has at least a guide wheel that rides on the exterior of the rodless cylinder . The carriage may include additional guide wheels A that run on other surfaces to prevent the carriage from rotating during launch.

In an embodiment as shown in where the launcher may launch human subjects the carriage is a lightweight structure designed to withstand the reaction forces of at least a 250 lbs payload accelerating at 5 Gs in addition to the force of gravity. Preferably the carriage is made of aluminum. In this embodiment the carriage includes a seat and a back support such that the human payload may sit in the upright position and thus the acceleration forces act parallel to the subject s spine. Furthermore the carriage may be configured to secure a human subject in a standing or sitting position. The carriage may further include protective shrouds that would keep human subject s body parts inside the structure of the carriage. The shrouds may further prevent objects from being caught in the carriage structure when it stops at the end of travel.

At the top of the carriage is a structure that is attached to a first cable that in is turn attached to the piston . As described earlier this structure connects the carriage to the piston to form the closed loop connection and the carriage piston counterbalancing system. Based on the counterbalancing system when the piston travels downward from its resting position the carriage is pulled upward by the cables .

In a specific embodiment the base of the carriage has at least a securing hook C as part of a latch mechanism that restrains the carriage prior to launch. depict an embodiment of the latch mechanism that restrains and releases the carriage . shows the latch mechanism restraining the carriage in a resting position. shows the latch mechanism releasing the carriage to a launch position. The latch mechanism may be located on any part of the launcher. Preferably the latch mechanism is on the base to minimize the weight of the carriage .

Still referring to the latch mechanism includes a securing device A and a releasing mechanism B. In this embodiment at least one securing device A holds the bottom end of the carriage in a resting position. The securing devices may be hooks clamps clips or other similar devices to hold a carriage in place. Furthermore the securing devices may be attached to a releasing mechanism such that when the releasing mechanism is triggered the securing devices release the carriage. The releasing mechanism could be a button that the user pushes a handle that the user pulls down a lever that is switched or any other types of mechanisms such as electromagnetic devices that can release a securing device.

At least one energy source provides the energy to propel the carriage and launch the payload. The potential energy is subsequently transformed to kinetic energy to propel the carriage. Different types of energy sources may be used. Energy sources such as a pneumatic system spring loaded system elastic cords hydraulic fluid or electromagnetic may be used. Furthermore combination of energy sources may also be used. In one embodiment as shown in the preferred energy source is a pneumatic system with compressed air. Compressed air which is readily available provides an easily transportable and portable means of storage. In this embodiment the compressed air is stored in a reservoir . The gas in a compressed air reservoir is compressible to a desired pressure. The reservoir may include a pressure gauge to monitor and or display the pressure. A subsequent pressure monitor may be located on a launch control panel. Structurally the reservoir is preferably coupled to the base of the launcher. In this configuration a pneumatic feed tube fluidly couples the reservoir to the rodless pneumatic cylinder . Alternatively the energy source reservoir may be coupled to other parts of the launcher.

Operationally the controllable launcher can propel a payload through a predictable and repeatable trajectory to a desired height and distance. show schematics of a specific embodiment of the launcher with compressed air as the energy source. In the reservoir is pressurized through the reservoir inlet valve A. Excess pressure may be vented through reservoir vent valve B. While pressurizing the reservoir the launch valve and feed tube vent valve are closed. Initially the piston is in the up position as shown in and B. Based on the counterbalancing system the carriage is accordingly in the down or resting position and may be restrained by the latch mechanism . Releasing the latch mechanism triggers a cascade of pneumatic events that launch the payload. Just before releasing the latch to initiate launch as shown in the launch valve is opened to preload the piston. Opening the launch valve forces the pressurized air into the cylinder via the pneumatic feed tube . The pressurized air drives the piston to the bottom of the rodless cylinder . Based on the closed loop connection and the piston carriage counterbalancing system a movement of the piston drives the carriage in an opposite direction. In this instance the downward movement of the piston propels the carriage in the upward position. Accordingly the payload is propelled and launched at the set trajectory. shows that while the piston is plummeting towards the bottom of the cylinder the low pressure air in the cylinder is vented through the cylinder vent .

In another embodiment of the invention which may not include a latch mechanism the launching process is controlled by actively modulating the launch valve . In this embodiment the energy source may be variable or fixed. In an embodiment with compressed air the reservoir may be set at a fixed pressure and the user can control the launch by regulating the launch valve . The carriage accelerations may also be controlled by the active modulation of the launch valve in an embodiment where the air pressure is varied or fixed.

After launching the payload the launcher triggers a mechanism to shut off the supply of energy. In this embodiment the shut off mechanism includes the shut off lever B and a cable A connecting the lever to the launch valve . As shown in when the carriage reaches the top of the guide rail A it activates the shut off lever B to close the launch valve . In another embodiment the carriage may activate a switch when it reaches the top end of the guide rail A. The switch could be a lever sensor electronic switch button or any similar switch. In addition the switch could be triggered manually by the carriage or by an automatic timer.

In the embodiment of the switch is a lever B connected to the launch valve via a valve cable A. The carriage can trigger the lever B to close the launch valve . Operationally when the carriage travels up the guide rail A it triggers the lever B which causes the valve cable A to move the valve arm C and thus close the launch valve .

Turning back to the operating mechanism of the launcher shown in while the carriage prepares to trigger the shut off lever B the piston would be plummeting down the cylinder . As the piston passes the cylinder vent during its plummet the vent can now expel the piston driving high pressure gas following it. Preferably the cylinder vent is near the bottom of the cylinder such that when the piston travels downward low pressure gas is pushed out the vent and once the piston passes high pressure gas is rapidly released through the vent . Still referring to the feed tube vent valve may also be activated to expel the pressurized air present in the cylinder and feed tube .

To return the carriage to the prelaunch position and thus prepare for another launch the cylinder vent and feed tube vent valve may still be open as shown in to completely vent the cylinder and feed tube . In other words opening the feed tube vent valve and the cylinder vent allows the carriage and piston to be returned to the prelaunch position without a buildup of pressure within the cylinder . Thereinafter the feed tube vent valve is closed to repeat the sequence for another launch.

The launcher includes a deceleration mechanism to minimize the movement of the launcher during the launch. The deceleration mechanism decelerates the carriage as the carriage reaches its peak velocity. The deceleration mechanism also helps to keep the launcher statically stable. Referring back to the deceleration system is activated when the carriage reaches the top of the guide rail A. The deceleration system comprises a carriage arresting bracket stopper at least a decelerating cable and spring retaining cylinder with a least a spring . Preferably the carriage arresting bracket is coupled to the carriage and the spring retaining cylinder contains a stack of disk springs. In one embodiment the carriage arresting bracket is mounted to the top of the carriage . The stopper is located near the top of the guide rail A. The stopper may be a shock absorbing material. As shown in the stopper is connected by the deceleration cables to a stack of springs in the spring retaining cylinder . The spring retaining cylinder is rigidly coupled to the base . A method of operating the deceleration system begins when the carriage reaches the top end of the guide rail and the payload is launched. In an embodiment a carriage arresting bracket shown in on the top end of the carriage slams into the stopper . The impact of the carriage may move the stopper . Any movement of the stopper will pull upward on the spring stack in the spring retaining cylinder . Accordingly a stronger carriage impact may compress more springs in the spring retaining cylinder to stop any further movement of the carriage.

A decelerating device is also present at the base of the rodless cylinder to absorb the energy of the piston . Referring back to the initial launch process as shown in as the piston propels downward the piston is stopped when it contacts a shock absorbing material not shown at the bottom of the cylinder. In one embodiment the shock absorbing material is a stack of spring washers. The shock absorbing material could be a spring or material with shock absorbing properties.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the decelerating devices may be any device or material that may absorb energy. Examples of such energy absorbing material may be a fluid or electromagnetic damper. Furthermore during the deceleration operation the forces from the carriage and piston deceleration are substantially equal but in opposite directions due to the counterbalancing property of the components. Accordingly these substantially equal but opposite forces substantially cancel each other out and thus minimize excessive movements of the launcher throughout the launch and deceleration process.

Referring now to a method of using the launcher to launch a payload to a specified height comprises aligning the launcher calculating the energy required for the launch and launching the payload. In an embodiment with a latch mechanism the step of launching the payload may further comprise latching and releasing the carriage.

The first step of aligning the launcher may further comprise aligning the launcher with the leading edge of the destination structure calculating the horizontal distance of the launcher from the destination structure and calculating the required energy for the launch. After leveling the base of the launcher a user aligns the guide rail with a leading edge of the destination structure to ensure that the payload will land a safe impact distance from the edge of the structure. The preferred 80 degree launch angle optimizes the safe impact distance from the edge of the destination structure while minimizing the horizontal velocity at impact. In a working example as shown in a launcher may be fixed at a preferred angle to ensure the payload lands at a safe distance from the edge of the structure.

A calculation of the horizontal distance from the destination structure may help determine the launch parameters. When the platform is properly leveled the horizontal distance from the building to the launch platform with respect to the vertical height of the building is a fixed ratio. Therefore the energy required to launch the payload is be calculated based on the payload mass and the height of the building determined by the trigonometric relationship shown in of the horizontal distance between the device and the building. Next the user determines the energy required for the launch. To vary the height of the trajectory the user may vary the amount of energy used to propel the carriage.

The device will launch the payload on trajectories as shown in the example of . In this example the preferred angle is fixed at 80 degrees. However the angle of the guide rail could be varied. In the preferred embodiment the set angle ensures there is sufficient horizontal travel to place the payload a safe distance from the edge of the roof while keeping the horizontal velocity at impact at a manageable level.

The step of aligning the launcher may be performed manually or automatically. When done manually a user performs the initial tasks and sets the launcher to the specified positions. In an embodiment with automatic alignment capabilities a user may simply input a variable in a control panel as described infra and the processor can calculate the launch parameters based on the measured parameters. Some of the automatic alignment devices may include a rangefinder to determine the height of the destination structure and the distance of the launcher from the destination structure.

Turning back to the working example in where the alignment scope of the launcher is fixed at 80 degrees the alignment scope is used to sight the leading edge of the building above which the payload is to be launched. The launcher is moved horizontally until the edge of the building comes into view using the alignment scope. When the platform is properly leveled the horizontal distance from the building to the launch platform with respect to the vertical height of the building is a fixed ratio. Thus the energy required to launch the payload is calculated based on the payload mass and the height of the building determined by the horizontal distance between the device and the building.

After aligning the launcher a user may for safety reasons restrain the carriage before beginning the next step of calculating the energy required for the launch. In a specific embodiment with a mechanical latch the latch restrains the carriage in down position as shown in . The payload may now be loaded. After restraining the carriage the energy source may now be prepared for launch. In an embodiment with compressed gas as the energy source the gas may now be compressed to the required pressure for the desired height. Preferably the above steps of aligning the launcher and latching the carriage are performed sequentially or simultaneously. However the steps could be performed in any order.

The next step is to launch the payload. To start launch sequence the launch valve is opened and pressure is applied to the piston . The user may then release the latch mechanism. Based on the mechanics of the launcher in this embodiment releasing the latch mechanism triggers a cascade of events described below which eventually launch the payload. When the carriage is latched in the down position the piston is in the up position. As the latch mechanism is released the pressurized air drives the piston to the base of the rodless cylinder. Based on the closed loop connection and counterbalancing system of the piston and the carriage a movement of the piston drives the carriage in an opposite direction. In this instance the downward movement of the piston propels the carriage in the upward position. Accordingly the payload is propelled and launched at the predictable trajectory. Turning back to the example in based on the predictable and controllable trajectory of the launched payload several vertical feet of over travel will ensure that the payload can safely clear the edge of the building. Furthermore this trajectory also allows the device to be used between buildings in an alley. In this example the total flight time will be less than 2 seconds to reach the top of a 5 story building.

In one embodiment of the invention the operation of the launcher is automated. In this embodiment the steps of aligning the launcher and latching the carriage may be automated. In a specific embodiment the launcher may be automatically aligned by the automated leveling mechanisms. Here a user provides an input and alignment devices such as range finders can measure the vertical and horizontal distances to the destination structure. Next the processor may calculate the required energy for a launch. In this embodiment a user simply loads the payload and the launch process is automated. To automate the launch process a load cell on the carriage may determine the weight of the payload. Using feedback control systems the launcher may determine the required energy to launch the payload to the desired trajectory.

Other embodiment of the automated launcher may have automated valve control mechanism. In such embodiments the launcher may not include a latch mechanism. Here the launcher control systems may control the energy or piston velocity through the modulation of the valves. In one specific embodiment the launcher may have a fixed energy such as at a fixed pressure and the launcher control system can control the air pressure in the rodless cylinder A piston velocity and or the carriage accelerations based on active modulation of the launch valve .

In another embodiment of the launcher the carriage may include a device to further propel the payload during the launch. In certain embodiments the device may be a charged cylinder bellow or spring that may further propel the payload base on the principle of the conservation of momentum. In a specific embodiment the supplemental payload propelling device is a charged cylinder coupled to the seat of the carriage but underneath the payload. During operation the charged cylinder propulsion mechanism is cocked during the launch. The charged cylinder may be fired during or near the end of the launch. On activating the supplemental payload propelling device the device imparts additional energy to the payload. Furthermore the supplemental payload propelling device may be used to decelerate the carriage after launch. In this deceleration application the device may impart an equal and opposite force to decelerate the carriage. In such an embodiment where the supplemental payload propelling device may produce a deceleration force the launcher may not include certain components of the deceleration mechanisms such as the deceleration springs described earlier. Other specific embodiments may include the supplemental payload propelling device that can impart a precise deceleration force to decelerate the carriage to zero velocity such that the launcher may potentially not require the carriage and piston deceleration springs.

Additionally the launcher may have a launch control panel to control the launch process. This launch control panel may have all the gauges and devices such as an alignment scope and distance calculator to enable a user to set the launcher. In this embodiment preferably the control panel is coupled to the launcher. Alternatively the control panel may be connected to the launcher by hard wire or telemetry. A remotely controllable launcher facilitates control from a distance. Thus this feature broadens the types of payloads that may be launched.

Other embodiments of the launcher may be mobile. In a mobile launcher embodiment the base may have other components to facilitate movement. The components could be devices such as wheels or tracks that enable the launcher to be easily moved. In a mobile launcher embodiment the guide rail assembly could be collapsible to make the launcher portable mobile and easily transportable. Additionally the energy source reservoir may be located in another area e.g. in the transporter but fluidly connected to the launcher. Furthermore each component of the launcher may be optimized for minimum weight and maximum strength.

In view of the foregoing it will be understood that the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims is not limited to the embodiments described herein and that the above and numerous additional variations and modifications could be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention.
