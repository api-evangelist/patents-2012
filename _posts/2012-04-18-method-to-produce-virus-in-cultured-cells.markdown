This application claims priority of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 476 497 filed Apr. 18 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirely herein.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. AI078063 and Grant No. CA082396 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Since the ability to obtain adequate viral yields can limit vaccine manufacturing improved methods of virus production are always needed to meet an important industrial and medical need. Previous work Munger et al. 2 e132 2006 Munger et al. 26 1179 86 2008 has demonstrated that human cytomegalovirus HCMV induces the synthesis of fatty acids and importantly that the virus requires the de novo synthesis of fatty acids to generate an optimal yield of infectious progeny. Despite this understanding U.S. Pat. No. 5 360 736 discloses that that addition of lipids during growth of certain viruses and in particular after initiation of infection of the cultured cells inhibits virus production.

Preparation of stock virus is necessary for development of therapeutic methods and materials. Accordingly improved methods for virus production are useful for improving virus yield and more specifically for vaccine production.

Provided herein is a method for increasing the yield of virus production from cultured cells. In general a method is provided wherein supplementation of growth medium with a fatty acid increases the yield of viruses produced in infected cells in culture compared to the same method carried out in the absence of the fatty acid. In view of the art the method provides an unexpected improvement on methods routinely practiced. The method provided is useful in combination with routinely utilized variables relating to conditions of cell growth and cell maintenance both prior to infection and after virus infection of the cells in culture and in combination with known methods of harvesting preparing stabilizing and storing virus stocks that are described in U.S. Pat.

Additional aspects and details of the invention will be apparent from the following examples which are intended to be illustrative rather than limiting.

The possibility that the yield of HCMV could be improved was tested by adding specific fatty acids to the medium of infected human MRC5 fibroblasts American Type Culture Collection .

Cells were infected with the AD169 strain of HCMV at a multiplicity of 0.5 infectious units cell and immediately following a 2 hour adsorption period cells were fed with medium Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM containing 10 fetal calf serum plus various fatty acids cholesterol and carbonyl scavenging compound. At 96 hours post infection infectious virus in the medium was assayed by fluorescent focus assay using antibody to the HCMV IE1 protein.

Briefly About 90 confluent MRC5 human fibroblasts were infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of 0.5 IU cell. Two hours after infection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 fetal calf serum and either of oleic acid OA up to about 100 M linoliec acid LA up to about 100 M linolenic acid LLA up to about 100 M eicosapentaenoic acid EPA up to about 75 M or docosahexaenoic acid DHA up to about 50 M . The experiment was also performed in the presence of either aminoguanidine AG up to about 250 M or cholesterol chol. up to about 13 M . Virus production at 96 hours after infection was determined by fluorescent focus assay in MRC 5 cells and shown as a fold change relative to no treatment NT which was 5 10infectious units. The fold changes are the average of two independent infections. Results are shown in .

As is evident in oleic acid OA reduced the yield of HCMV linoleic acid LA had little effect on the yield and linolenic acid LLA increased the yield by about 1.2 fold. Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA increased HCMV yield by factors of 2.5 and 4.6 respectively. Further although aminoguanidine alone increased the yield of HCMV by a factor of about 2.6 the increase resulting from addition of the carbonyl scavenging compound was reduced by inclusion of OA LA or LLA. In contrast aminoguanidine plus EPA gave a slightly higher yield than either additive alone and the combination of aminoguanidine plus DHA increased the yield by a factor of 6.2 a substantially higher yield than achieved with no additive or either additive alone. Addition of cholesterol alone cholesterol solution Sigma Aldrich S5442 had no effect on HCMV yield and it did not improve and in some cases inhibited the enhancing effects of fatty acids. These results show that the addition of fatty acids can enhance the yield of HCMV obtained from cultured MRC5 fibroblasts and this enhancement can be further increased by inclusion of a carbonyl scavenging compound.

Experiments along the line of those conducted in Example 1 were designed to determine whether the addition of other fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives e.g. arachidonic acid AA or its derivatives alone or in combination with cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives with or without aminoguanidine or another carbonyl scavenging compound or a free radical scavenging compound could enhance the yield of HCMV.

Briefly about 90 confluent MRC5 fibroblasts were infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of 0.5 IU cell. Two hours after infection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 fetal calf serum and tocopherol T or aminoguanidine AG at indicated concentrations. Virus production at 96 h after infection was determined by fluorescent focus assay in which MRC 5 cells and shown as a fold change relative to no treatment NT . The fold changes are the average of two independent infections. Results are set out in .

This enhancement could be observed in MRC5 fibroblasts other fibroblasts or other cell types suitable for the growth of HCMV. To the extent that the alternative fatty acid cholesterol carbonyl scavenging compounds and cell types enhance the production of HCMV this invention encompasses their use in the process of virus growth. shows an example of second carbonyl scavenging compound free radical scavenging compound alpha tocopherol T which enhances the production of HCMV as observed for aminoguanidine.

Further certain formulations of natural or artificial fatty acids which can be elongated and or unsaturated within cells to produce AA or DHA respectively are used to substitute for AA or DHA.

An exemplary but not limiting embodiment of this invention includes supplementation of medium supporting MRC5 cells with docosahexaenoic acid DHA a dietary essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid PUFA plus aminoguanidine a carbonyl scavenging compound.

The possibility was tested that the yield of VZV also could be improved by adding specific fatty acids to the medium of infected human MRC5 fibroblasts.

For this test MRC5 cells passage 20 25 were seeded at a density of 300.000 cell 100 mm culture dish and grown in 15 ml of DMEM containing 10 fetal calf serum plus 2 mM glutamax Invitrogen at 35 C. A lipid mixture LM 1 1 ml liter medium Sigma Aldrich L5146 was added to the cells either at the time of seeding or 1 day after seeding. Three days later the culture medium was replaced with 10 ml growth medium containing 50 mM sucrose as a stabilizer. The cells were further incubated for 3 days and growth medium was replaced with fresh medium containing no sucrose. After cells reached confluence they were infected with VZV by adding infected cells 1 infected cell 50 uninfected cells infected cells were from a preparation frozen in a solution of 10 DMSO plus 90 fetal calf serum and stored in liquid nitrogen . At the time of infection the cultures were re fed with DMEM containing 10 fetal calf serum plus 2 mM glutamax. Arachidonic acid AA alpha tocopherol T or DHA T were added at the indicated times. 72 hours after infection cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 10 ml of PBS containing 50 mM ammonium chloride for 50 minutes at 4 C. The cells were harvested and frozen in PSGC buffer Harper et al. 143 1163 70 1998 at 80 C. Infectious virus was subsequently quantified by plaque assay of sonicated cells on ARPE 19 cells American Type Culture Collection . Results are set out in .

Results indicates that addition of LM 1 during cell growth prior to infection enhanced the virus yield by a factor of nearly two but addition at 1 day after infection did not enhance virus production. However addition of AA T or DHA T at various times after infection enhanced the production of infectious virus with the greatest enhancement of virus yield occurring when the fatty acid and carbonyl scavenging compound were added between 1 6 hours post infection.

The experiment was repeated varying the amount of fatty acid and T added to MRC5 cells at 6 hours post infection and the results are set out in .

Briefly in these repeat experiments MRC5 cells were infected with VZV at an MOI 1 50. AA DHA and T were added to the cells at 6 hpi as indicated. 72 hours after infection the cells were harvested into PSGC buffer and frozen at 80 C. for later processing. After thawing the cells were sonicated and the yield of cell free VZV quantified by standard plaque assay on ARPE 19 cells. Fold change relative to no treatment NT is shown. indicates that the composition produced cytotoxicity that was evident upon visual inspection. The fold changes are the average of two independent infections.

As shown in in the absence of the carbonyl scavenging agent 25 M AA enhanced the yield of virus whereas 100 M AA inhibited virus production in contrast in the presence of T both doses of AA increased the virus yield with 100 M showing the greatest increase at 5 fold. Similarly 25 M DHA alone increased the yield by a factor of about 1.5 whereas 25 M DHA T produced a 7.5 fold increase. 100 M DHA was toxic in the absence or presence of T.

These experiments demonstrate that the addition of certain fatty acids together with a carbonyl scavenging agent after infection with VZV augment the production of infectious progeny. The addition of the non essential fatty acid oleic acid 100 M reduced VZV production by a factor of 2 without causing observable cellular toxicity.

In the experiments presented in the infected cells were harvested into PSGC buffer frozen subsequently thawed and disrupted by sonication and then titered. Next the yield of infectious virus obtained by this method was compared to an alternative method where infected cells were harvested into PSGC buffer immediately disrupted by sonication and then frozen at 80 C. prior to titration.

In brief MRC5 cells were infected with VZV at an M01 1 50. Lipid mixture 1 LM 1 was added to the cells immediately after cell seeding. At 6 hours after infection up to about 100 M AA or 25 up to about M DHA was added to cells together with up to about 10 M T. 72 hours after infection the cells were harvested into PSGC buffer and either frozen at 80 C. and sonicated later for the release of virus frozen cells or immediately sonicated after harvesting and supernatants containing the cell free VZV were frozen at 80 C. frozen sup. prior to titration. Cell free VZV yield was quantified by plaque assay on APRE 19 cells. Fold change relative to no treatment NT is shown. The numbers above the bars indicate the amount of virus obtained per ml in the corresponding treatment. The results are set out in .

Having improved the yield of infectious VZV by sonicating infected cells in PSGC buffer before freezing tested the effect of additional fatty acids hexacosanoic acid HSA and octacosanoic acid OSA and fatty acid combinations on virus production was tested. Results are set out in .

Although HSA and OSA improved virus yields in comparison to no treatment these additional fatty acids and combinations did not perform as well as DHA T. Further high doses of two combinations generated less virus than no treatment presumably due to toxicity resulting from high total concentrations of the combined fatty acids.

Briefly MRC5 cells were infected with VZV at an MOI 1 50. Six hours after infection cells were treated with indicated combinations of lipids plus 10 M T. Hexacosanoic acid HSA and octacosanoic acid OSA were dissolved in 20 mg ml cyclodextin Sigma Aldrich in PBS by sonication and added to a solution of 10 mg ml fatty acid free BSA Sigma Aldrich in PBS 1 1 v v to give a stock concentration of 10 mM for each fatty acid. HSA OSA and DHA were used at 25 M and AA was used at 25 M. Two sets of fatty acid concentrations was used for combination treatments DHA AA and HSA was either added at concentrations of 25 M 100 M and 25 M high or 10 M 50 M and 10 M low respectively. 72 hours after infection the cells were harvested into PSGC buffer sonicated immediately and the yield of cell free VZV quantified by plaque assay on ARPE 19 cells. Fold change relative to no treatment NT is shown. The fold changes are the average of two independent infections. Results are shown in .

It is possible that the relatively poor performance of HSA and OSA in the experiment presented in resulted from difficulty in achieving efficient delivery of the fatty acids to cells. Alternative formulations of the fatty acids are contemplated to improve uptake and stimulate more efficient virus production.

Next the possibility that the addition of cholesterol would further enhance the elevated yields obtained by supplementation with fatty acids was tested.

MRC5 cells were infected at a MOI of 1 100 and harvested either at 48 or 72 hours after infection. As controls the cells were treated with two different mixtures of lipids immediately after cell seeding. LM 1 is rich in omega 3 fatty acids and LM 2 Invitrogen 11905 is a chemically defined mixture that contains mainly omega 6 fatty acids.

Briefly MRC5 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 fetal calf serum 2 mM glutamax Invitrogen at 35 C. as described in the text. Lipid mixture 1 LM 1 Sigma or 2 LM 2 Invitrogen was added to the cells immediately after seeding. The cells were infected with VZV at an MOI 1 100. Six hours after infection cells were treated with indicated lipid combinations plus 10 M T. HSA and DHA were used at 25 M and AA was used at 100 M. Where indicated 13 M cholesterol was added on the cells. 48 or 72 hours after infection the cells were harvested into PSGC buffer sonicated immediately and the yield of cell free VZV quantitated by standard plaque assay on ARPE 19 cells. Fold change relative to no treatment NT harvested at 48 hpi is shown. The numbers above the bars indicate the amount of virus obtained per ml in the corresponding treatment. The fold changes are the average of two independent infections. Results are set out in .

Both lipid mixtures slightly and similarly elevated VZV yields at both times. The effects of these lipid mixtures were not as large as the effects of the individual fatty acids. DHA AA and HSA were tested with T and as in previous experiments each of these additives elevated the yield of VZV at 72 hours post infection. Cholesterol was also tested as a supplement and at 72 hr after infection it increased the yield of VZV by a factor of about two relative to no treatment. Yields were much lower at 48 than at 72 hours after infection. Finally the effect of cholesterol addition to DHA T and DHA HSA T was tested and it proved to further increase the yield of VZV. At 72 hours post infection 9.6 10PFU ml of infectious VZV was achieved by supplementation with DHA T plus cholesterol.

The yield of virus particles by quantifying the amount of viral DNA in virus stocks by using quantitative PCR qPCR was then quantified.

Virus stocks were treated with DNase I before qPCR analysis. Before DNase I treatment cellular DNA was detected in virus stocks using primers specific for the actin locus but after treatment with the enzyme cellular DNA was no longer detected. This observation demonstrated that the DNase I treatment effectively degraded DNA in the virus stocks that was not protected within virus particles. Each copy of DNase I resistant VZV DNA was taken as a proxy for one virus particle.

Briefly cell free VZV was obtained from the cells treated with the indicated combinations of lipid mixture LM 1 Sigma DHA about 25 M plus T about 10 M and cholesterol about 13 M as described in the legend to . The samples were treated with DNAse I 2 units 30 min 37 C. to remove contaminating DNA outside the viral envelope and the number of particles containing viral genome was determined by quantitative real time PCR analysis. In parallel the amount of virus produced was determined by plaque assay and infectivity of the viruses was calculated by dividing the number of enveloped virus particles by number of infectious virus produced particle PFU . The results are shown as fold change relative to no treatment NT .

The amount of infectivity in each sample was determined in parallel by plaque assay. As shown in the number of virus particles and the specific infectivity of the particles were little changed by LM 1 as compared to no treatment. Addition of DHA T at 6 hours post infection increased the number of virus particles and also increased the particle PFU ratio by a factor of nearly 2. Addition of DHA T cholesterol had no effect on the specific infectivity of virus particles particles PFU but it increased the number of virus particles by a factor of 9.

Importantly then addition of DHA T cholesterol at 6 hours post infection increased the yield of virus particles and infectivity by a factor of 9 at 72 hours post infection as compared to no treatment.

Briefly ARPE 19 and MRC5 cells were infected with VZV at an MOI 1 250. The indicated combinations of DHA 25 M T 10 M and cholesterol chol. 13 M was added to the cells at 6 hpi. The cells were photographed 72 hours after infection. As shown in foci were larger in cells treated with DHA T and larger yet when treated with DHA T cholesterol consistent with the view that the treatments accelerated virus spread from cell to cell.
