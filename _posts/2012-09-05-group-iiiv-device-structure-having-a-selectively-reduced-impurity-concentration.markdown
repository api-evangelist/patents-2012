The present application claims the benefit of and priority to a provisional application entitled Impurity Graded III Nitride Material Structures and Methods Ser. No. 61 537 540 filed on Sep. 21 2011. The entire disclosure in this provisional application is hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE AR0000016 awarded by Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ARPA E . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

As used herein the phrase group III V refers to a compound semiconductor that includes a group V element and at least one group III element. Moreover the phrase III Nitride or III N refers to a compound semiconductor that includes nitrogen N and at least one group III element including aluminum Al gallium Ga indium In and boron B and including but not limited to any of its alloys such as aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN indium gallium nitride InGaN aluminum indium gallium nitride AlInGaN gallium arsenide phosphide nitride GaAsPN and aluminum indium gallium arsenide phosphide nitride AlInGaAsPN for example. III Nitride also refers generally to any polarity including but not limited to Ga polar N polar semi polar or non polar crystal orientations. A III Nitride material may also include either the Wurtzitic Zincblende or mixed polytypes and may include single crystal monocrystalline polycrystalline or amorphous structures.

Group III V semiconductors such as gallium nitride GaN or other III Nitride materials are used in many microelectronic implementations in which high power density and high efficiency switching are required. Examples of such implementations include field effect transistors FETs and high electron mobility transistors HEMTs .

Although the intrinsic material properties of III Nitride semiconductors enable fabrication of high performance devices in theory as a practical matter conventional growth environments for III Nitride materials typically include impurity sources. The presence of those impurity sources in the III Nitride growth environment can cause unintentional doping of critical device layers. In HEMTs for example as well as in other high speed switching devices such unintentional impurity doping may adversely compromise device performance.

The present disclosure is directed to a group III V device structure having a selectively reduced impurity concentration substantially as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures and as set forth more completely in the claims.

The following description contains specific information pertaining to implementations in the present disclosure. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present disclosure may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed herein. The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary implementations. Unless noted otherwise like or corresponding elements among the figures may be indicated by like or corresponding reference numerals. Moreover the drawings and illustrations in the present application are generally not to scale and are not intended to correspond to actual relative dimensions.

Group III V semiconductors include III Nitride materials formed of gallium nitride GaN and or its alloys such as aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN indium gallium nitride InGaN and aluminum indium gallium nitride AlInGaN . These materials are semiconductor compounds that have a relatively wide direct bandgap and strong piezoelectric polarizations and can enable high breakdown fields and the creation of two dimensional electron gases 2DEGs . As a result III Nitride materials such as GaN are used in many microelectronic implementations in which high power density and high efficiency switching are required. Examples of such implementations include field effect transistors FETs high electron mobility transistors HEMTs and diodes.

As previously discussed although the intrinsic material properties of III Nitride semiconductors enable fabrication of high performance devices in theory as a practical matter conventional growth environments for III Nitride materials typically include impurity sources. For example carbon impurities resulting from metalorganic sources may be introduced into III Nitride materials grown using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy MOCVD also known as organometallic vapor phase epitaxy OMVPE . The presence of impurity sources in the III Nitride growth environment can cause unintentional doping of critical device layers.

In transistors such as HEMTs for example unintentional impurity doping may undesirably result in an increased dynamic Rdson and other effects adversely impacting device performance. However it is noted that careful manipulation of the growth conditions used to produce III Nitride or other group III V semiconductor materials can selectively reduce the impurity profiles within certain key device regions to enhance or optimize device performance.

The present application discloses semiconductor materials including III Nitride materials and methods of forming these materials so as to have continuously reduced or otherwise selectively reduced impurity concentrations. For example by grading or otherwise tailoring the impurity concentration profiles within a layer or layers of a HEMT device structure the present application enables formation of electronic devices which exhibit low leakage low dynamic Rdson high punch through lateral breakdown and high vertical breakdown or standoff capability.

It is noted that although carbon impurity concentrations are specifically referenced in the application different impurity species may be present and may be selectively reduced according to the present concepts. For example carbon C oxygen O hydrogen H silicon Si germanium Ge magnesium Mg beryllium Be zinc Zn iron Fe chromium Cr and cadmium Cd may be unintentionally present or selectively introduced to specific layers or structures in a III Nitride or other group III V semiconductor structure. Furthermore while these specific impurity materials are described it will be appreciated that additional impurities can be included in a semiconductor structure without departing from the scope of the present concepts.

Moreover it is further noted that impurity concentrations resulting from the presence of environmental impurity sources in the growth environment during growth of a III Nitride or other group III V material body can correspond in general to the growth rate and or growth temperature of the body during its fabrication. For example a decrease in impurity concentration of a III Nitride body may result from a decrease in the growth rate of the III Nitride body during growth. Conversely a decrease in impurity concentration of a III Nitride body may result from an increase in the growth temperature of the III Nitride body during growth.

It is noted that when a layer or body is referred to as being on over or overlying another layer body or substrate the layer or body described as on over or overlying can be directly on the underlying layer body or substrate or an intervening layer or body may also be present. A layer described as directly on another layer body or substrate indicates that no intervening layer or body is present. It is further noted that when a layer or body is referred to as being on over or overlying another layer body or substrate the layer or body described as on over or overlying may cover the entire underlying layer body or substrate or a portion of the underlying layer body or substrate.

Moreover as used herein the term impurity doped graded layer or impurity graded layer refers to a layer having an impurity concentration profile that varies across at least a portion of the thickness of the layer. Thus group III V intermediate body includes at least two different impurity concentrations at different depths within the layer. As is described in greater detail below the impurity concentrations e.g. dopant profiles or grading schemes of group III V intermediate body can be varied in a number of ways. Although the selectively reduced impurity concentration may change across group III V intermediate body according to any of a variety of impurity concentration profiles it may be advantageous for such a profile to have a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface and a lower impurity concentration at top surface . It is generally advantageous to tailor the selective reduction of the impurity concentration within group III V intermediate body in a manner that provides sufficient device properties including low leakage low dynamic Rdson high punch through lateral breakdown and high vertical breakdown standoff capability.

In certain implementations in addition to group III V intermediate body having a selectively reduced impurity concentration group III V intermediate body may be a compositionally graded. III Nitride body. That is to say group III V intermediate body may have a first III Nitride composition at bottom surface and a second III Nitride composition above bottom surface such as between bottom surface and top surface .

In addition it is noted that the impurity concentration of group III V intermediate body being selectively reduced as disclosed herein may be produced by more than one impurity species. Under those circumstances one two or more of the impurity concentrations may be continuously or otherwise selectively reduced between bottom surface and top surface resulting in a reduced overall impurity concentration at top surface relative to bottom surface . Moreover the impurity concentrations corresponding respectively to each impurity species may be reduced based on similar or dissimilar impurity concentration profiles.

Transition body group III Nitride intermediate body and III Nitride device layer correspond in general to transition body group III V intermediate body and group III V device layer respectively in . Also shown in are bottom surface of transition body and top surface of III Nitride device layer . Substrate may be formed of materials such as silicon carbide SiC bulk III Nitride material Si sapphire or any other suitable material. Furthermore substrate may be single crystal polycrystalline or a composite substrate.

As used herein a silicon or Si substrate may refer to any substrate that includes a silicon surface. Examples of suitable Si substrates include substrates that are composed entirely of Si e.g. bulk Si wafers silicon on insulator SOI substrates silicon on sapphire substrates SOS and separation by implantation of oxygen SIMOX process substrates. Suitable Si substrates can also include composite substrates that have a silicon wafer bonded to another material such as diamond aluminum nitride AlN or other polycrystalline materials.

In some implementations Si substrates having different crystallographic orientations may be used. In some cases silicon 111 substrates may be advantageous. In other cases silicon 100 or 110 substrates may be preferred. In certain other implementations the Si substrate such as substrate may have various device layers homojunctions heterojunctions or circuit layers embedded in the substrate or formed on the front side or hack side of the substrate. Such a silicon substrate may be semi spec standard thickness or thicker or in some implementations thinner than semi spec standards. In some implementations for example the Si substrate may have a diameter of less than one hundred millimeters 100 mm while in other implementations the substrate may have a diameter in a range from approximately 100 mm to approximately 150 mm. In yet other implementations the substrate diameter may be in a range from approximately 150 mm to approximately 200 mm or larger. In still other implementations the silicon substrate may include a textured surface or may have a non planer surface.

As shown in transition body is fabricated over substrate . Transition body may be fabricated as a III Nitride body including two or more interlayers as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 449 046 filed on Mar. 3 2011 and titled III Nitride Material Interlayer Structures and may further include other transition layers reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6 617 060 issued on Sep. 9 2003 and titled Gallium Nitride Materials And Methods U.S. Pat. No. 6 649 287 issued on Nov. 18 2003 and titled Gallium Nitride Materials And Methods U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 12 928 946 filed on Dec. 21 2010 and titled Stress Modulated Group III V Semiconductor Device and Related Method the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

In addition or alternatively transition body may include a III Nitride or other group III V transition structure. For example transition body may include a III Nitride superlattice structure or structures as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 649 287 issued on Nov. 18 2003 and titled Gallium Nitride Materials And Methods U.S. Pat. No. 7 112 830 issued on Sep. 26 2006 and titled Super Lattice Modification Of Overlying Transistor U.S. Pat. No. 7 456 442 issued on Nov. 25 2008 and titled Super Lattice Modification Of Overlying Transistor and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 531 508 filed on Sep. 13 2006 and titled Process for Manufacture of Super Lattice Using Alternating High and Low Temperature Layers to Block Parasitic Current Path the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

In some implementations transition body includes a III Nitride or other group III V transition structure having a selectively modified impurity concentration such that a bottom surface impurity concentration of the group III V transition structure is selectively modified to a top surface impurity concentration of the group III V transition structure. For example in one implementation the impurity concentration of transition body may be selectively modified between bottom surface of transition body and a top surface of transition body underlying bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body . Such a selective modification of the impurity concentration in transition body may be performed utilizing a number of different impurity concentration profiles or dopant grading schemes. For example the impurity concentration may be selectively modified continuously in a step wise manner or may rise and fall between the bottom surface impurity concentration and the top surface impurity concentration. In addition the impurity concentration may be selectively modified across the entire thickness of transition body or across only a portion of transition body .

Referring to III Nitride intermediate body in some implementations III Nitride intermediate body may be a binary constant composition such as MN GaN or indium nitride InN for example. However in other implementations it may be preferable that the III Nitride intermediate body be composed of an alloy of a III Nitride material such as AlInGaN AlGaN and InGaN. It is noted moreover that III Nitride materials having other compositions may also be used.

As further shown in III Nitride intermediate body having bottom surface is fabricated over transition body . III Nitride intermediate body may be of constant alloy composition or in certain other implementations may be compositionally graded between bottom surface and top surface . In one implementation for example the alloy composition of III Nitride intermediate body may be continuously graded between bottom surface and top surface . III Nitride device layer may then be fabricated over top surface of III Nitride intermediate body .

When semiconductor structure forms a HEMT it may be advantageous to fabricate III Nitride device layer to include a GaN channel layer GaN channel layer not shown as such in having a low impurity concentration so as to minimize trapping centers and enhance 2DEG formation within III Nitride device layer . However in certain other implementations it may be preferable that III Nitride device layer be intentionally doped wither either N type or P type dopants depending on the device design and intended application. In substantially all cases reducing the impurity concentration for example the carbon impurity concentration within III Nitride device layer as well as reducing the impurity concentration across at least a portion of III Nitride intermediate body is desirable.

For example it may be advantageous or desirable to continuously reduce the impurity concentration between bottom surface and top surface of III Nitride intermediate body in a manner consistent with the penetration depth of critical electric fields produced by application of a drain bias voltage to a device fabricated in III Nitride device layer . It is noted that as used herein critical electric field is defined as the minimum field associated with an applied voltage on the drain which results in a high probability of changing the charge state of an impurity residing within the critical electric field perimeter within a III Nitride layer s . The critical electric field is proportional to the maximum applied drain bias voltages during operation of the device. As a result in certain implementations it may be desirable for III Nitride intermediate body to have a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface and a lower impurity concentration at top surface . It may also be advantageous to have the lower impurity concentration at top surface be maintained at a substantially constant low level into III Nitride device layer .

The impurity concentration in III Nitride intermediate body may be reduced between bottom surface and top surface utilizing a number of different impurity concentration profiles or dopant grading schemes. For example the impurity concentration may be reduced continuously in a step wise manner or may rise and fall between the higher impurity concentration and the lower impurity concentration for example. In addition the impurity concentration may be reduced across the entire thickness of III Nitride intermediate body or across only a portion of the thickness.

The impurity concentration profiles represented in can correspond in general to the growth rate and or growth temperature of III Nitride intermediate body as noted above. For example fabricating III Nitride intermediate body so as to selectively reduce its impurity concentration from a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface to a lower impurity concentration at top surface may correspond to selectively reducing the growth rate of III Nitride intermediate body from a higher growth rate at bottom surface to a lower growth rate at top surface . Conversely fabricating III Nitride intermediate body so as to selectively reduce its impurity concentration from a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface to a lower impurity concentration at top surface may correspond to selectively increasing the growth temperature of III Nitride intermediate body from a lower growth temperature at bottom surface to a higher growth temperature at top surface .

As a specific example of the latter implementation the growth temperature at bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body may be approximately 930 C. and may remain substantially unchanged during the first approximately 1 micrometer 1 um of growth. Thereafter the growth temperature may be increased by approximately 20 C. to approximately 40 C. for each approximately 1 um of growth up to a higher temperature in a range from approximately 1000 C. to approximately 1020 C. at top surface . Such an increase in temperature may be continuous or step wise for example.

Referring to presents graph corresponding to a continuously reduced impurity concentration across III Nitride intermediate body in according to an exemplary implementation. Graph includes impurity concentration profile showing a continuous reduction of impurity concentration at a substantially constant rate from bottom surface to top surface of III Nitride intermediate body .

Moving to presents graph corresponding to another exemplary implementation of a reduced impurity concentration across III Nitride intermediate body . Graph includes impurity concentration profile showing a continuous reduction of impurity concentration at a substantially constant rate from bottom surface to a depth within III Nitride intermediate body denoted as d . The continuously reduced impurity concentration shown by impurity concentration profile then maintains a substantially constant value at an impurity concentration lower than the impurity concentration at bottom surface between depth d and top surface of III Nitride intermediate body .

In some implementations III Nitride intermediate body may be an impurity graded superlattice or an impurity graded or compositionally graded superlattice. That is to say III Nitride intermediate body may include two or more alternating sub layers of III Nitride materials having different III Nitride compositions. Moreover the two or more alternating sub layers may have different impurity concentrations or different selectively reduced impurity concentration profiles. Four exemplary superlattice implementations are shown in .

Referring to presents graph A corresponding to another exemplary implementation of a selectively reduced impurity concentration across III Nitride intermediate body . Graph A includes impurity concentration profile A showing an exemplary impurity concentration profile resulting from alternating sub layers when III Nitride intermediate body is fabricated as a superlattice. According to the implementation shown in each alternating sub layer of the superlattice has a different but substantially constant impurity concentration level throughout the sub layer. A stepwise change in impurity concentration occurs at the sub layer interfaces and results in a reduced impurity concentration from bottom surface to top surface .

Moving to presents graph B corresponding to another exemplary implementation of a selectively reduced impurity concentration across III Nitride intermediate body . Graph B includes impurity concentration profile B showing another exemplary impurity concentration profile resulting from alternating sub layers when III Nitride intermediate body is fabricated as a superlattice. According to the implementation shown in one of the sub layer impurity concentrations is held substantially constant across the superlattice layer at the lower impurity concentration. The other sub layer has a graded impurity concentration which continuously decreases at a substantially constant rate across the superlattice sub layer.

In impurity concentration profile C of graph C also shows that one of the sub layer impurity concentrations is held substantially constant across each iteration of the sub layer within the superlattice at the lower impurity concentration. However according to the exemplary implementation of the intervening sub layers have respective impurity concentrations that decrease in a stepwise fashion across the superlattice while remaining substantially constant within each sub layer of the superlattice. Alternatively impurity concentration profile D of graph D in shows both alternating sets of sub layers within the superlattice having impurity concentration profiles that decrease stepwise across the superlattice while remaining substantially constant within each sub layer of the superlattice.

It is reiterated that the impurity concentration profiles of III Nitride intermediate body illustrated in are merely exemplary. In other implementations the impurity concentration of III Nitride body may be selectively reduced according to other profiles that are within the scope of the present inventive concepts. Moreover in addition to selectively reducing the impurity concentration across III Nitride intermediate body from bottom surface to top surface the present concepts also include tailoring the impurity concentration profile across other portions of semiconductor structure as shown in .

Referring to presents graph B corresponding to a selectively reduced impurity concentration showing a continuous reduction in impurity concentration across portions of semiconductor structure according to another exemplary implementation. Graph B includes impurity concentration profile B showing a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration at a first rate of reduction across transition body from bottom surface of transition body to bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile B then shows a stepped reduction in impurity concentration at bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body followed by a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration at a second rate of reduction from bottom surface to depth d in III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile B then shows a substantially constant low level impurity concentration from depth d through top surface of III Nitride intermediate body to top surface of III Nitride device layer .

Moving to presents graph C corresponding to a selectively reduced impurity concentration showing a continuous reduction in impurity concentration across portions of semiconductor structure according to still another exemplary implementation. Graph C includes impurity concentration profile C showing a continuous and substantially constant high impurity concentration across transition body and across bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body to depth a in III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile C then shows a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration from depth a to depth d in III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile C further shows a substantially constant low level impurity concentration from depth d through top surface of III Nitride intermediate body to top surface of III Nitride device layer .

Referring to presents graph D corresponding to a selectively reduced impurity concentration showing a continuous reduction in impurity concentration across portions of semiconductor structure according to another exemplary implementation. Graph D includes impurity concentration profile D showing a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration at a first rate of reduction across transition body from bottom surface of transition body to bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile D then shows a stepped reduction in impurity concentration at bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body followed by a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration at a second rate of reduction from bottom surface to depth a in III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile D also shows a continuous and substantially constant reduction in impurity concentration at a third rate of reduction from depth a to depth d in III Nitride intermediate body . Impurity concentration profile D then shows a substantially constant low level impurity concentration from depth d through top surface of III Nitride intermediate body to top surface of III Nitride device layer .

The impurity concentration profile across transition body may be step wise and may rise and fall as shown in and or may correspond to a transition layer scheme including additional interlayers each having a different respective impurity concentration as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 449 046 filed on Mar. 3 2011 and titled III Nitride Material Interlayer Structures the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application. The impurities or dopants giving rise to the impurity concentration profile of transition body may be unintentionally present or may be intentionally added during fabrication of transition body .

III Nitride device layer of semiconductor structure in may include a FET or a HEMT for example. In implementations in which semiconductor structure forms a HEMT III Nitride device layer may be seen to represent any or all of several layers including for example a GaN channel layer an AlN spacer layer an AlGaN barrier layer and other layers including passivation metal and P type III Nitride gate layers needed for device formation.

In implementations in which III Nitride device layer corresponds to a GaN channel layer of a HEMT device it may be desirable for the impurity concentration and in particular for the concentration of P type impurities to be substantially minimized. For example an undesirably high P type or other impurity concentration may interfere with electron mobility and 2DEG formation and in some instances may result in increased dynamic Rdson increased leakage and lower standoff or breakdown voltages. In practice the thickness of the GaN channel layer may be relatively thin. That is to say the GaN channel layer may be no thicker than necessary to support heterojunction formation such that a conductive 2DEG channel forms near the heterojunction interface.

In some implementations III Nitride device layer may be implemented as a GaN channel layer having a thickness in a range from approximately 0.1 um to approximately 0.5 um. In other implementations III Nitride device layer may be implemented as a GaN channel layer having a thickness in a range from approximately 0.15 um to approximately 0.25 um. Several HEMT structures formed of various III Nitride device layers corresponding to III Nitride device layer are described in U.S. Pat.

Is some implementations semiconductor structure may form a high voltage FET or HEMT. In such implementations the device geometries and or III Nitride material layer thicknesses may need to be altered to accommodate the high voltage and resulting critical high voltage electric fields. For example as the applied voltage is increased for a given device the electric field associated with the drain electrode will also increase in both the lateral direction and the penetration depth into the device structure. At higher applied voltages in a HEMT structure the penetration depth of the electric field may extend under the drain region to a depth greater than the 2DEG and perhaps greater than the thickness of III Nitride device layer thereby extending into III Nitride intermediate body . Under such conditions any impurities within the channel region of III Nitride device layer or even within some regions of III Nitride intermediate body may act as trapping centers and may subsequently change the charge state within the effected layers resulting in degradation of high voltage HEMT performance. As a result it may be desirable to reduce or substantially minimize the impurity concentrations not only in the channel region of III Nitride device layer but also into III Nitride intermediate body .

By contrast it may be advantageous to have a relatively high impurity concentration such as a high carbon concentration below III Nitride device layer in order to improve the resistivity of III Nitride intermediate body and thereby improve standoff voltage capability. The result is a conflicting set of design objectives driven by the need for a high impurity concentration e.g. carbon concentration in III Nitride intermediate body to enhance breakdown resistance and concurrently a low impurity concentration e.g. carbon concentration in III Nitride intermediate body to minimize trapping and to reduce dynamic Rdson. That conflict may be resolved by implementing III Nitride intermediate body having a selectively reduced impurity concentration wherein a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface is selectively reduced to a lower impurity concentration at top surface as disclosed herein.

Referring now to a III Nitride material stack is shown which forms a typical GaN based HEMT structure . Structure includes transition body . As noted above transition body may be formed as a III Nitride transition body including AlN for example. Transition body may be fabricated over a III Nitride nucleation strain relieving layer s other additional layer s as well as a substrate corresponding to substrate in substrate and any layers underlying transition body not shown in .

Structure also included III Nitride intermediate body having bottom surface fabricated over transition body . In some implementations it may be preferred that III Nitride intermediate body be fabricated as a constant alloy composition of AlGaN where 0.04

As further shown in III Nitride device layer is fabricated over layer III Nitride intermediate body . III Nitride device layer represents the III Nitride HEMT device layers and may include several sub layers including GaN based channel layer AlGaN barrier layer and spacer layers and dielectric layer or other layers . Although three exemplary sub layers are shown in other layers or sub layers may also be included and are within the scope of the present inventive concepts. Also shown in is 2DEG and drain contact or electrode . It is noted that source and gate contacts or electrodes are omitted from for conceptual clarity.

If properly constructed structure will generate 2DEG near the interface of GaN channel layer and the AlGaN barrier layer included in AlGaN device layers . According to the implementation shown in structure provides a depletion mode normally ON HEMT and 2DEG would exist in a state when there is no applied gate voltage. 2DEG includes high mobility electrons which are the majority carriers traveling from the source not shown to drain contact or electrode of structure .

During operation of the HEMT when a voltage bias is applied to drain contact or electrode of structure a critical electric field will be generated under drain contact or electrode that is proportional to the voltage applied to drain contact or electrode . It is reiterated that as used herein critical electric field is defined as the minimum field associated with an applied voltage to drain contact or electrode which results in a high probability of changing the charge state of an impurity residing within the critical electric field perimeter of an effected III Nitride layer s .

As an example for a given voltage V applied to drain contact or electrode the corresponding critical electric field is shown in as E. Ewill penetrate into GaN channel layer and may also extend into III Nitride intermediate body to a depth denoted as d in . Any impurities or trapping centers which fall within the penetration depth of Ehave an increased probability of having their charge states altered.

As the applied voltage is increased to a higher voltage V the critical electric field Ewill influence the charge state of the impurities deeper into III Nitride intermediate body to depth d. As a result the probability of changing the charge state will increase within that extended field effected area. At high voltage operation the critical electric field denoted as Ewill influence the charge states even deeper into the III Nitride intermediate body to depth d and the probability of changing charge states is increased still further.

If there are any P type impurities e.g. carbon impurities located within GaN channel layer and III Nitride intermediate body there is a high probability that their charge states will change if they fall within a region subject to the critical electric fields. These changed charge state impurities or traps can adversely impact the switching speed and dynamic Rdson of the HEMT formed by structure . Consequently it is desirable to minimize impurities or acceptor states within GaN channel layer as well as in III Nitride intermediate body within the regions subject to the critical electric fields formed during operation of the device. Therefore depending on the penetration depth of the critical electric fields it would be desirable to reduce or substantially minimize impurity concentrations within GaN channel layer and also within at least a portion of III Nitride intermediate body .

However as discussed above there is the conflicting objective of fabricating III Nitride intermediate body to have a high concentration of carbon impurities near bottom surface and into underlying transition body to improve the resistivity and enhance the standoff voltage capability of the HEMT formed by structure . shows three examples of solutions for resolving the apparent conflict by selectively reducing the impurity concentration from a higher impurity concentration at bottom surface of III Nitride intermediate body to a lower impurity concentration at top surface of III Nitride intermediate body .

For example if structure is designed for a low voltage application e.g. V then under an applied voltage to drain contact or electrode a corresponding critical electric field Ewill develop in proximity to the drain region and penetrate to a depth of d within III Nitride intermediate layer . Consequently it would be desirable to form III Nitride intermediate layer such that the carbon impurity concentration starts at a higher level upon initiation of growth i.e. at bottom surface followed by a continuous decrease at a constant rate to a lower level at a depth of at least d. It would then further be desirable to maintain the impurity concentration at or near the lower level throughout the remainder of the growth of III Nitride intermediate body i.e. to top surface . By selectively reducing the carbon impurity concentration to a lower i.e. substantially minimal concentration at a depth of d the present solution reduces or substantially minimized the population of carbon impurities with the highest probability of having their charge states changed under biasing of the device at voltage V .

Alternatively if structure is designed to operate at a higher drain voltage of V then it would be desirable to minimize the carbon impurity concentration within the area influenced by the subsequent critical electric field Eto depth d within III Nitride intermediate body . According to this implementation an impurity concentration profile analogous to that formed in response to Ecan be formed in III Nitride intermediate body . However the rate of reduction of the impurity concentration can be increased such that a lower i.e. substantially minimal impurity concentration is reached at depth of d as shown in .

Moreover if structure is designed to operate at a yet higher drain voltage of V it would be desirable to minimize the carbon impurity concentration within the area influenced by the subsequent critical electric field Eto an even deeper depth within III Nitride intermediate layer denoted as d. Once again an impurity concentration profile analogous to that formed in response to Ecan be formed in III Nitride intermediate body . However the rate of reduction of the impurity concentration can be increased still more such that a lower i.e. substantially minimal impurity concentration is reached at depth of d as shown in .

Thus implementations of the present inventive concepts provide a group III V device structure having a selectively reduced impurity concentration. By fabricating a group III V device layer over a group III V intermediate body having a selectively reduced impurity concentration improved device performance and reliability may be achieved. For example by continuously reducing the impurity concentration from a higher impurity concentration at a bottom surface of the group III V intermediate body to a lower impurity concentration at a top surface of the group III V intermediate body the present solution enables reduced leakage and enhanced standoff voltage capability while concurrently enabling high speed switching by reducing or substantially minimizing sources of undesirable dynamic Rdson.

From the above description it is manifest that various techniques can be used for implementing the concepts described in the present application without departing from the scope of those concepts. Moreover while the concepts have been described with specific reference to certain implementations a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the scope of those concepts. As such the described implementations are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. It should also be understood that the present application is not limited to the particular implementations described herein but many rearrangements modifications and substitutions are possible without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
