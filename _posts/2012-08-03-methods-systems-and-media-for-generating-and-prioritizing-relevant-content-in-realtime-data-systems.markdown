This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 514 847 filed Aug. 3 2011 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 514 835 filed Aug. 3 2011 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 162 527 filed Jun. 16 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The disclosed subject matter relates to methods systems and media for generating and prioritizing relevant content in real time data systems. More particularly methods systems and media for generating content items from received content and prioritizing relevant content items in real time data streams by scoring content items based on real time data e.g. real time content real time online trend data influence data and or user interest and behavior data and or preferences associated with an entity.

Entities such as consumers and digital publishers are constantly searching for approaches to discover and promote the most relevant content at the right time. Advertisers are constantly striving to reach their followers and fans with their messaging and do that via the publishing of relevant content.

Current approaches for determining relevancy in the real time data stream generally rely on the manual creation of search queries across a set of real time content and filtering the results based upon proximity to the keywords in the search query. In addition other factors that may be used to filter real time content include the relevancy to a user the time the content was published the engagement of the content published or the influence of the content publisher. These approaches result in a basic match of the real time content to the query and provide basic capabilities but do little to provide deep differentiation among similar content. Additionally these approaches lack an ability to differentiate content based upon real time popularity or the relative change in popularity. These approaches further lack and lag in understanding the dynamic and ever changing language used in the real time web and have an incomplete vocabulary or data set to understand the nature of the meaning of the keywords in their queries. Limiting the real time data to a finite set of characters has a causal effect on the language and words used by consumers leaving traditional natural language processing or keyword search methodologies limited in efficacy.

To further complicate the current problem real time data is growing exponentially in terms of data and content produced. The growth in quantity and diversity of such data is making discoverability a more acute problem for consumers not to mention creating a difficult challenge in determining the relevance of individual pieces of content.

In accordance with various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter methods systems and media for generating and prioritizing relevant content in real time data systems are provided.

In some embodiments a method for recommending content for publishing is provided the method comprising receiving using a hardware processor content from one or more content sources determining using the hardware processor one or more term entities associated with the content calculating using the hardware processor a score of the one or more term entities based on a frequency a recency and a density at which the one or more terms appear in one or more real time information sources and recommending using the hardware processor a content item for publication to at least one of the one or more real time information sources based on the score wherein the content item comprises at least a portion of the received content.

In some embodiments a system for recommending content for publishing is provided the system comprising a processor that is configured to receive content from one or more content sources determine one or more term entities associated with the content calculate a score of the one or more terms based on a frequency a recency and a density at which the one or more terms appear in one or more real time information sources and recommend a content item for publication to at least one of the one or more real time information sources based on the score wherein the content item comprises at least a portion of the received content.

In some embodiments a non transitory computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method for recommending content for publishing is provided. The method comprising receiving content from one or more content sources determining one or more term entities associated with the content calculating a score of the one or more terms based on a frequency a recency and a density at which the one or more terms appear in one or more real time information sources and recommending a content item for publication to at least one of the one or more real time information sources based on the score wherein the content item comprises at least a portion of the received content.

In accordance with various embodiments mechanisms for generating and prioritizing relevant content in real time data systems are provided. Using these mechanisms a user may be provided with content that was automatically generated based on the user s preferences and that was ranked based on one or more criterion. The user may choose to publish such content to an account on one or more social media networks blogs microblogs social networking services etc. In some embodiments a user may include a natural person an organization a member of an organization a franchisee of an organization or any combination of these.

In some embodiments content may be automatically generated based on the user s preferences. In some embodiments content may be automatically generated from content sources designated by the user. As used herein it should be noted that content sources may include any suitable destination where content may be retrieved or requested. As used herein it should be noted that content may include any suitable professionally published content such as articles in an electronically published magazine newspaper or professional weblog and or any suitable user generated content such as personal weblogs status updates on a social networking Web site e.g. FACEBOOK MYSPACE YOUTUBE etc. messages posted on a social messaging Web site e.g. TWITTER pages on a personal photography Web site etc. . In some embodiments generating content items from video or image data may be performed based on metadata associated with the video or image data or an analysis of the content of the image or video using image analysis techniques. It should also be noted that content may be provided in any suitable form such as audio video images text etc. or any suitable combination thereof as well as snippets or fragments of those content elements.

In some embodiments content may be generated based on real time information where real time information may include any content that has been published recently including user generated content. In some embodiments real time information includes information published within the last week within the last twenty four hours within the last six hours or any suitable length of time. Alternatively the user can set a particular length of time from which real time information can be retrieved e.g. retrieve content for generating content items where the content was published within the last twelve hours .

In some embodiments content may be generated manually by a user creating content to be posted. Any content that is generated may be generated or transformed into the form of a post or a tweet depending on the platform on which the content may be published. For example a tweet may be published to a TWITTER account where a tweet may be a short message e.g. a message limited to 140 characters by the service provided by TWITTER . As another example a post may be published on a FACEBOOK page where there may be fewer limitations on the form of the content. As yet another example a post may be published to a LINKEDIN page where there may be a slightly different set of requirements for text and graphical image content than on a FACEBOOK page. As a further example a post may be published to a PINTEREST page where there is a requirement that a graphical image photo or video be included with the content. As another further example a post may be published to an INSTAGRAM page where there is a requirement that a photograph be included with the content. As used herein it should be noted that content that is generated to be published is referred to as a content item or content items which is intended to encompass any content that a user may publish using the processes systems and media described herein.

In some embodiments after content items are generated the content items may be scored and or ranked. The score may be representative of the likelihood that other users may engage with the content item based on the historical popularity of topics in the content item and or trends in the popularity of the topics in the content items. In some embodiments a user may designate a specific pool of users or a specific topic for use in determining the popularity of content. In some embodiments a user may designate certain topics and or interests that if determined to be similar to keywords in the content items result in a higher score. In some embodiments the content items may be ranked in accordance with the determined score. This may allow a user to publish content that is more in line with areas that the user may be interested in rather than any and all topics that are currently popular. For example the user may choose to publish the content items ranked at or near the top which are more likely to coincide with the users designated topics and or interests as well as the overall popularity of the topics in the content item.

In some embodiments content items may be generated by scoring content created by others and recommending that the user re use that content if the content has a score greater than a particular value. In some embodiments the content information may contain an attribution to the original creator or author of the content.

In some embodiments scored content items may be recommended to the user for publishing based on the calculated score. In some embodiments content items may be recommended to the user based on the score and other variables such as the date the content item was created or the date that the content upon which a content item is based was first published. Alternatively in some embodiments content items may be recommended based on how recently the content upon which a content item is based was first published without calculating a score.

In some embodiments a user may create a profile with settings that determines how content items are generated and recommended. The settings may be used to determine which sources to generate content items from e.g. particular sites particular feeds etc. and where to publish content items e.g. particular accounts on a social messaging service . In some embodiments the user may link accounts from several different social networking services to a profile where the number of accounts that may be linked may only be limited by the amount of accounts that the user has registered and or has the right to publish on. Alternatively in some embodiments the number of accounts may be limited to a predetermined number.

In some embodiments a profile may be linked to other profiles whereby content items that are generated in the profile may be automatically recommended in the other profile s . Similarly content items generated in the other profile s may be automatically recommended in the user s profile. In some embodiments users may be able to link and unlink their profile s to the other profiles and the amount of other profiles that the user s account may be linked to may be limited to an arbitrary number or may be unlimited. In some embodiments a profile may be a subordinate profile associated with a master profile. In such an embodiment a user of the subordinate or child profile may be inhibited from publishing content unless and until that content is also approved for publishing by a user of the master profile.

In some embodiments an interface may be provided that allows a user to choose from multiple content items that have been generated for publication and which accounts and services to publish the content to. In some embodiments the interface may be provided using a website or an application downloaded and or installed on a user device.

In some embodiments information about the engagement of other users of the services where the content was published may be made available to users in any suitable format such as a graph a spreadsheet a textual summary or any suitable combination thereof.

In some embodiments content items may be advertisements that may be scored in a similar way as other content items whereby the expected engagement is estimated based on various factors. This may allow a user to anticipate what advertising may be the most effective based on the recent popularity of topics and other relevant information.

It should be noted that these mechanisms may be used in a variety of applications. Applications can include automated ranking of real time content based upon relevancy filtering content based upon relevancy and or acting upon relevant content based upon business rules and logic such as sharing publishing and promoting the content . These applications can be implemented within the real time data networks themselves e.g. the social networks marketplaces e.g. Facebook Ads advertising systems or applied across digital assets such as web pages portals search engines etc. for the delivery of more relevant consumer experiences. For example digital publishers and advertisers working through their content management systems are constantly searching for approach to place the most relevant content in front of the right user at the right time in order to increase traffic to their websites. Using the score e.g. based on frequency recency and density components content can be ranked at instances prior to presenting it to a browser. In another example these mechanisms can also assist entities with determining what content they should produce acquire or syndicate based upon the relative popularity of the content or content topic areas.

In a more particular example the owner of a small business may not have the resources to devote to building a presence on social media and may not have the resources to manage social media accounts. In such an example the owner may employ the mechanisms disclosed herein to post content that is likely to be relevant and is also likely to be germane to the owner s business.

In another more particular example a franchisor or parent company such as MCDONALDS may encourage its franchisees to use the mechanisms described herein to build a social media presence in the franchisees area at low cost. By allowing the franchisor to create an initial campaign there would be a greater chance that the franchisee uses the mechanisms thereby increasing the value of the brand for the franchisor and the franchisee alike. However in such an example the franchisor may wish to exert substantial control over the content being published by the franchisees as negative publicity about a franchisee may have a negative effect on the franchisor s brand. In such a case franchisees may be assigned a subordinate profile associated with a master profile controlled by the franchisor. In this example there may be restrictions placed on what the franchisee may publish using the subordinate profile without approval. For example the presence of certain words in content created on behalf of the franchisee may prevent publication unless the content is approved by the franchisor via the master profile. Alternatively all content that is not pre approved by the franchisor may be flagged for review before publication is allowed.

Turning to a process for publishing content in accordance with some embodiments is illustrated. As shown after the process starts at a profile may be created for a user at . In some embodiments a profile may be created by the user of the profile. Alternatively in other embodiments the profile may be created at by an administrative user that has the ability to set and adjust profile settings for other users e.g. an administrative user at a master profile that creates child profiles for other users . The administrative user may disable some features of the profile such that the user cannot use the disabled features. Such disabled features may be greyed out or otherwise disabled in any suitable way including by deleting the features from an interface shown to the user. In some embodiments the profile created at may be a master profile or a dependent profile. A dependent profile may be a profile that is dependent on one or more master profiles. Examples of the relationship between master profiles and dependent profiles are described in connection with A C and A D below. In some embodiments a master profile may also act as a dependent profile and vice versa.

At after a profile is created at the user may adjust one or more settings of the profile to fit the user s particular preferences and or needs. Non limiting examples of the settings that may be adjusted by the user are described in more detail in connection with B and C. In some embodiments one or more of the settings for a profile may be pre filled or automatically populated with default values which may be based on information previously entered by the user creating the profile. For example when an administrative user creates a dependent profile for a user that is dependent on a master profile the dependent profile may have default settings that are the same or similar to the master profile. As another example if a user already has one or more profiles a newly created profile may have default values that are the same or similar to the settings for the user s one or more other profiles. In some embodiments an administrative user may change one or more of the settings for a profile of another user at any time including at the creation of the profile.

At it may be determined whether the user chooses to publish content based on the settings adjusted by the user at and or other user input. Illustrative examples of how a user may choose whether to publish content are described in connection with FIGS. and A D. If it is determined that the user chooses to publish a content item Yes at it may be determined at if any accounts are linked to the profile that was created at . Examples of accounts that may be linked to a profile include any account where a user may publish content items to be seen by others on a private semi private or public basis. For example accounts may include any or all of the following a TWITTER account a FACEBOOK account a MYSPACE account a GOOGLE account a TUMBLR account a LINKEDIN account a PINTEREST account a blog or any other suitable type of account. A profile may be linked to multiple accounts of each type so long as the user of the profile or an administrative user may give permission to publish to the account. In some embodiments before a content item is published a user may select which accounts if any to publish the content.

If it is determined at that there is at least one account linked to the profile and selected by the user then the content item that was chosen by the user is published at . If no content item is chosen to be published No at or there are no accounts linked to the profile No at the process may be directed to to determine if the user has chosen to return to the settings for the profile. If the user has chosen to return to the settings Yes at the process may be directed to where the user may be allowed to further adjust the settings for the profile. Otherwise the process moves back to to determine if there is a content item chosen or selected to be published.

Referring to as mentioned above an example of a process for allowing a user to select which content items if any to publish at in accordance with some embodiments is illustrated. After process begins at the user may be provided with an opportunity to create free content at . For example the user may create new additional or updated content items prior to or in between the generation of recommended content items. In a more particular example includes a display screen that includes an interface for entering free text or free content. More particularly the user may use interface to create a content item such as Check out the latest features in the RallyDeck . . . along with a URL or any other suitable link to the content. These newly created free content items may be included when determining which content items to recommend for publication. It should also be noted that if free content items have been created after the recommendation of content items has been made at the newly created free content items may be placed into a pool or grouping of available content items and the recommendation engine can update the corresponding scores and or ranking for each content item including the newly created free content items .

Process then generates recommendations on particular content items to publish at . In some embodiments generating recommendations about what content items to publish may include generating a score that approximates the popularity of the topics in each content item. An example of how such a score may be generated is described in more detail below with respect to . In some embodiments generating recommendations may include automatically creating content items from content sources chosen by the user and ranking the automatically created content items based on one or more variables which may or may not include a score.

At it may be determined whether there are any approved content items associated with the profile. If there are approved content items associated with the profile Yes at the process may be directed to . After a content item associated with a profile has been generated the content item may be designated as a pending content item. A profile may have several different types of content associated with it which may include pending content approved content and published content. These different types of content may be displayed to a user in any suitable manner to differentiate the different types of content. For example approved content and pending content may be displayed to users in different areas or may be displayed in different colors. Examples of how pending approved and published content may be displayed to a user are described with regard to the example in and A C.

A user of the profile may designate any or all of the content items that are pending as approved content items by for example performing an action that changes the status of a pending content item to an approved state. In some embodiments if a profile is a dependent profile associated with one or more master profiles content items that are designated as approved in the master profile may be automatically associated with the dependent profile and designated as approved. In some embodiments a user may freely change the status of pending and approved content items by for example designating an approved content item as pending or vice versa. In some embodiments a user of a profile may delete content items that are pending approved or published. In some embodiments the ability of the user of a dependent profile to change the status of content items or delete content items may be restricted. For example a user of a dependent profile may be restricted from designating content items that are approved by a corresponding master profile as pending. In another example a user of a dependent profile may be restricted from deleting content items that are approved by a corresponding master profile. In yet another example a user of a dependent profile may indicate a desire to delete a content item and in response to providing the indication an approval request may be transmitted to a user of a corresponding master profile.

In some embodiments if a user of a dependent profile approves a content item that content item or an indication of the approval may be transmitted to a user of the master profile for approval prior to designating the content item as approved. In such a case the content item may be marked as provisionally approved pending review or any other suitable manner of marking content item to convey that the content item has been approved by the dependent profile but has not yet been approved by the master profile. In some embodiments the dependent profile may be allowed to publish some content without receiving approval from a user of the master profile but the presence of certain terms or topics may trigger review of the content items by the user of the master profile before the content items may be published. A dependent profile with restrictions such as these may sometimes be referred to as a subordinate profile.

At it may be determined if the auto publishing setting has been selected in the settings. If the auto publishing setting has been selected in the settings Yes at the process may be directed to where the next approved item may be published if the conditions of the auto publish setting are satisfied. An example of the auto publish setting is described in connection with .

It should be noted that in some embodiments the auto publishing setting may perform more than publishing the next available content item on the list of recommended content items. Rather in response to selecting the auto publishing setting it may be determined which content items are preferable to publish based on one or more criterion. For example in response to selecting the auto publishing setting appropriate times for serving recommended content items may be determined. In a more particular example the recommendation component of the mechanism or any other suitable component may determine timing characteristics for association with each recommended content item e.g. best time of the day preferred day of the week for the given term. It should be noted that the frequency in the settings may serve as a minimum time between posts or publications.

If there are no approved items at No at and or auto publishing has not been selected No at the process may be directed to and may bypass . At regardless of whether any content item has been auto published it is determined if the user of the profile has chosen to manually publish a content item. If a user chooses to manually publish a content item Yes at the content item may be manually published at to the corresponding account s the user has indicated to publish such a content item to and process returns back to generate recommendations of content items at or returns back to provide the user with an opportunity to create free content items at . If the user chooses not to manually publish a content item process returns back to where recommendations of content items are generated and or process returns back to where the user is provided with an opportunity to create free content items e.g. Check out the latest features in the RallyDeck . . . in interface of .

As an example of generating content the user or an administrative user may provide authorization to collect real time data on its behalf across multiple sources or multiple real time data systems. This may include for example content assets that are owned operated licensed and or controlled by the user. This may also include for example other sources of real time data such as RSS feeds or XML feeds from different sources such as news organizations publishers various Web sites blogs microblogs etc. Collected real time data may also include for example any suitable professionally published content such as articles in an electronically published magazine newspaper or professional weblog and or any suitable user generated content such as personal weblogs status updates on a social networking Web site FACEBOOK MYSPACE etc. messages posted on a social messaging Web site e.g. TWITTER pages on a personal photography Web site etc. . The data may be mined scored an illustrative example of which is described hereinbelow and classified in order to determine the relative interest and the topic areas for the publishing entity as well as its owned or operated content assets.

It should be noted that content assets owned and operated by a user may include for example content that has been purchased by the user content that the user has a right to distribute e.g. by contract agreement fair use or any other form of right to distribute content that the user has a right or an agreement to promote content that is in possession of the user e.g. stored on an advertising server etc. More particularly the content may be scored and classified based at least in part upon the relative popularity of the content or the determined topic of the content with regard to the user s interests or topic areas as well as its relationship to its owned content. The relative relevance of matched content items is ranked in order for recommendation of publication.

The following process provides an illustrative example of the implementation of a prioritization system of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments a user may provide an authorization for the prioritization system to collect real time data on its behalf across multiple sources or multiple real time data systems. The multiple sources and or real time data systems may include for example a social media network a social messaging service a social content sharing service an e mail message an instant message a short message service SMS message a web service a web log and a search engine. This may also include for example content assets owned and operated by the user.

It should be noted that in some embodiments the user may set heuristic controls relating to relevance. This may for example allow the user to control how tight or loose the recommendation and scoring component of the system operates when discovering and or recommending content for publication. In a more particular example the publishing entity may set a particular score that must be attained prior to recommendation such as at least a score of 80 out of 100 in some embodiments. In another more particular example the publishing entity may set portions of a particular score that are achieved by a piece of content prior to recommendation such as at least a score of 30 in a frequency component at least a score of 40 in a recency component and at least a score of 50 in a density component.

In some embodiments real time content and interest data associated with the publishing entity may be collected from real time data systems. This data may be used to provide a rich interest and topic map for the user. The user s owned and operated content assets may be collected and indexed with regard to the previously collected topics and interests.

In some embodiments real time content and interest data associated with the user may be collected via explicit input of topics or keywords provided by the user. This data may be used to provide a rich interest and topic map for the user of topics that are of particular interest to the user as well as topics that are less relevant or forbidden from consideration.

In addition in some embodiments the prioritization system may review and add the user s unpublished real time content as a pending or approved content item for consideration for publication. For example based on content and interest data from real time data systems e.g. particular social networks particular weblogs etc. the prioritization system may recommend that the user publish particular pieces of content re sort the display order of content on a page etc. Additionally or alternatively the prioritization system may create an interest and topic map from data collected from multiple sources or real time data systems e.g. data from social networks and determine which unpublished real time content of the publishing entity should be presented to viewers.

In some embodiments real time content and interest data associated with the user may be derived from explicit keywords content that user has input feeds content the user has shared or published content engaged by the user s communities and or derived or explicit interests from the user s communities. The derived and explicit topics or interests may be used as targeting attributes for organic or paid advertisements to users.

In some embodiments the prioritization system may based on the interest and topics associated with the user be used to discover all high potential real time content across a user s connected network e.g. content generated by other users having a relationship with that user . For example the candidate content may be classified and scored for a contextual relevance to the user coupled with b a score measuring the relative relevance of the content to other users or a user base. It should be noted that the contextual relevance score may be determined for each candidate content item by matching the relevance of the candidate content text and entities to the interests and topics for the user derived or determined using the recommendation and scoring processes described herein. The content relevance score may ensure that the candidate content is relevant to the overall interest or topics of the user.

In some embodiments the user may rely on the prioritization system to create promotional content items to be published into real time data systems such as social networks and advertising systems. In such embodiments the prioritization system may programmatically author and structure the content to meet with the publishing environments requirements such as TWITTER FACEBOOK etc. .

Referring to as mentioned above an example of a process for calculating scores for content as part of generating recommendations for content at in accordance with some embodiments is illustrated. After process begins at scores for each content item may be generated at . In some embodiments scores may be generated for each content item that has a status of pending and or approved.

In accordance with some embodiments scores may be generated by calculating the proximity of each topic of interest to the content item being scored. More particularly a vector of representing dominant keywords derived from one or more real time sources may be created for each topic of interest a vector of keywords obtained from a content item or content snippet may be created for each content item and a vector similarity score may be calculated that indicates the proximity or distance between the topic of interest vector and the content item vector. The score may represent frequency and scarcity in keywords or vocabulary between topics of interest and content items.

In a more particular embodiment the vector similarity score may be calculated by determining cosine similarity which may be represented as 

In another more particular embodiment a keyword score in a vector of keywords may be calculated by using a TF IDF weighting or scoring approach for a keyword in a set of related content snippets against a broad vocabulary. For example the TD IDF score of value may increase proportionally to the number of times a keyword appears in the content items or content snippets but may also be offset by the frequency of the keyword in the content items or content snippets.

Upon calculating the similarity score for each topic of interest the scoring mechanism may determine the topic of interest with the highest score most relevant term . Additionally the scoring mechanism may determine the product of the highest similarity score with a velocity score that is calculated based on dominant entity frequency recency and density to product a final or revised score. This may allow the mechanisms to score the content items by trends and relevance. It should be noted that in some embodiments the score is kept in the range of about 0.5 and 1.5 to scale the final score into a predictable range. For example a score below 0.5 is adjusted to 0.5 and a score above 1.5 is scaled down to 1.5.

In a more particular embodiment the final score for ranking content items may be represented as RankingScore content maxRelevanceScore topic content . . . RelevanceScore topic content VelocityScore content 

Additionally or alternatively scores may also be generated that take into account at least one of the following recent popularity of terms used in the content items trends in the popularity of terms used in the content items the presence in the content items of topics and interests specified in the profile the presence of excluded topics specified in the profile and any suitable combination thereof.

In an example of a process for generating scores the process may begin by receiving topical entities of text. It should be noted that the determination of topical entities and or cleaning refining supplementing and or expanding the topical entities may be performed prior to receiving the topical entities of text.

The topical entities of text may be used as query inputs into real time information sources. Examples of real time information sources may include among others social media networks e.g. FACEBOOK LINKEDIN MYSPACE etc. social networking services e.g. TWITTER content sharing services e.g. DIGG web services e.g. SHARETHIS ADDTHIS and BIT.LY weblogs or blogs and or search engines e.g. GOOGLE .

This query may result in a recent portion of real time content. A vector may then be generated based on the real time content.

A density score for this real time content may be calculated as the standard deviation of the time between consecutive snippets. In a particular example the standard deviation of the times between consecutive tweets or postings containing a particular topical entity may be calculated. The standard deviation may indicate how close the tweets or postings containing the particular topical entity are. When tweets or postings are close in time i.e. frequent the standard deviation is a small number and the final score is higher.

This density score may observe the rate of change over time between real time content elements. For example the density score may compare the density of a particular content snippet with the density of the particular content snippet at a previous time. This may provide a relative understanding of the relative popularity of the real time content and topics over the time period observed as well as a directional indicator of its popularity.

In some embodiments the recency of the real time content may be observed. This observation may be directed to real time content generated in close proximity in relationship to time to the request for the score. The score for recency may observe the time distance and its distribution between the most recent real time content and the time of the score request. For example the recency score may be an integer that represents the average number or distribution of the number of seconds ago that the last N number of tweets or postings about a particular entity was published. It should be noted that the smaller the recency average number the smaller the integer that the recency average is mapped to for producing the final score. The recency factor may provide a score to bias the results towards the direction of popularity at the time of the score request.

In some embodiments the mechanism may combine the density score with the recency score into a score that favors recency but also accounts for density. The score may be in the range of 0 to 1 or any suitable number. The combination of the density score and the recency score may provide a relative measure of how popular the topic is among real time data participants. This combined score may be represented as follows 

It should be noted that a smaller recency score generates a higher TVas the density score plays a contributing role when two entities have the same recency score.

In some embodiments by tracking the velocity score over time the mechanism may also derive whether a topic is accelerating or decelerating in popularity in the real time web and as such influence the relative ranking of content in real time. For example this may be represented as the derivative of the velocity score over time 

In some embodiments the velocity score for various topical entities may be combined to yield a score for each content item that is either pending or approved. In some embodiments these scores may range from 0 to 1 with a higher score representing a more highly ranked content item. In some embodiments these scores may range from 0 to 100 or any other suitable range that will inform a user of which content items are rated as containing the most popular content.

In some embodiments the popularity acceleration and or deceleration may be taken into account when calculating a score where a topic that is trending more popular may yield a higher score which allows a user to take advantage of topics that are becoming more popular or avoid topics that are becoming less popular.

In some embodiments a user may enter topics in the profile where if a content item contains words that match the topic entered by the user then the content item will be given a higher score. This higher score may be generated by changing the multiplier for words that are related to the topics entered by the user. Alternatively the higher score may be generated by adding a constant for each matching term to the overall score or any other suitable method for biasing the score for items containing words related to the user entered topics. Topics are described in more detail in connection with the example illustrated in .

In some embodiments a user may enter excluded topics in the profile where if a content item contains words that match the excluded topic entered by the user then the content item will be discarded or given a lower score. In some embodiments the user may be allowed to choose how to treat content items containing excluded topics. Excluded topics are described in more detail in connection with the example illustrate in .

After scores have been calculated at the process may be directed to where it is determined if the text of any of the content items has been edited. If none of the content items have been edited No at the process may be directed to where it is determined if a preset amount of time has passed since scores have been calculated. If the preset amount of time has passed at Yes at or if the text of a content item has been edited Yes at the scores for pending and approved content items may be recalculated at . Otherwise the process returns back to . In some embodiments the preset time for recalculating the scores may be for example one minute five minutes thirty minutes etc.

Turning to B and C examples of a user interface for adjusting the settings associated with a profile in accordance with some embodiments are illustrated. illustrates an example of a user interface for adjusting the settings for a profile at . For example interface may include general settings including a field for entering a profile name a field for entering a description of the profile a dropdown for selecting how to rank content items a checkbox for selecting whether to automatically attach a hashtag s to content items a checkbox for selecting whether to auto publish content items a field for entering a maximum number of items to auto publish a field for entering how often to auto publish a field for entering a default destination check boxes for selecting where potential content items are to be generated from and a dropdown for selecting default publishing destinations.

Field may be used by the user or an administrative user to add a name for the profile or to change the name of the profile after the profile has been created. In some embodiments a user may be restricted from changing the name after the profile has been created. In some embodiments the profile name may be prefilled or automatically populated in field if the user is part of an organization and the profile is a dependent profile. For example in the case of a vehicle manufacturer such as GENERAL MOTORS the manufacturer may maintain a master profile. In such an example the manufacturer may encourage dealers of the manufacturer s vehicles to maintain dependent profiles to market the manufacturer s vehicles in particular geographic regions. In this case the field may be prefilled or automatically populated with the dealer s name or an identification number that the manufacturer uses to identify the dealer. The profiles for each dealer may be created by an administrative user employed by the manufacturer or may be created by a user employed by the dealer. Field for entering a description of the profile may have similar features to field . In some embodiments one of field or may be eliminated or may be replaced with a name without the ability to change the name.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with an option for indicating how content items are scored. Dropdown may be a dropdown menu that allows the user to adjust how content items are scored by the scoring process. For example the user may choose to score based on trends trends and relevance time or any combination of these. As described in the above mentioned equations and generally herein scoring based on trends may score content items based on a calculated velocity score calculated based on dominant entity frequency recency and density. As also described in the above mentioned equations and generally herein scoring based on trends and relevance may score content items based on overall and or global trends in real time information sources and based on topics and or interests entered in topics and interests settings. Scoring based on time may score content based only on the recency of the content items but not based on the relevance of the content items to overall and or global trends in real time information sources.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with an option for creating and or applying hashtags. Checkbox may allow the user to select whether the user prefers hashtags to be automatically inserted into content items. If checkbox is checked hashtags for example olympics2012 etc. may be inserted into content items created by the processes described herein. These hashtags may be generated based on a prominent or dominant trend entity present in or derived from the content item where the relative prominence or dominance may be determined based on the scoring described herein. In some embodiments a hashtag is only attached corresponding to the most prominent or dominant topic and or trend. In some embodiments a hashtag may be attached for each topic or trend that has a relevancy above a predetermined threshold where the maximum number may be limited to some arbitrary number such as one two three etc. In some embodiments an automatically created hashtag corresponding to a content item is provided to the user for approval and or modification. In some embodiments the hashtag may be used as targeting attributes for organic or paid advertisements to users.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with an option for automatically publishing content items. Checkbox may allow the user to select whether content items are to be auto published to accounts associated with the profile. If checkbox is checked items in the approved and or pending categories may be automatically published to accounts associated with the profile in accordance with the other settings set by the user. In some embodiments only content items categorized as approved are auto published. In some embodiments content items marked as approved as well as pending content items that have a score above a preset or user adjustable threshold may be auto published. In some embodiments non approved items with a score over a preset or user adjustable threshold may be auto published if there are no approved content items available to publish. In some embodiments any content that has the highest score among approved and or pending content may be auto published. If checkbox is unchecked content items are not auto published to any accounts that may or may not be associated with the profile. In some embodiments the mechanisms may take into account other criterion in addition to the calculated score for auto publishing where such criterion may include for example the time in the day the day of the week and the category of the judged content. Additionally by using historical performance the mechanisms may prioritize the scored content for publishing.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with options for publishing content items such as the number of content items to publish within a given time period. Fields and may allow the user to select how many content items to post over a given period of time. For example the user may enter 1 in field and 60 in field . In this example if checkbox is checked content items are auto published at a rate of a maximum of one item every hour. As another example the user may enter 5 in field and 20 in field . In this example if checkbox is checked content items are auto published at a rate of a maximum of five items every twenty minutes. As described above the content items that the auto publishing feature publishes may be based on the user s preferences. In a particular example where only approved items may be auto published the approved item with the highest score is auto published when enough time has elapsed since the last auto publication. In some embodiments the time between publications may be varied randomly or semi randomly to give the appearance that the content is not automatically being published every hour on the hour for example. In some embodiments the user may choose a range of time over which auto publishing may occur. For example the user may choose to publish only from 9 am to 5 pm local time. As another example the user may choose to publish at all times of the day and night. In some embodiments if a user chooses to manually publish a content item at this may count toward the maximum number of auto published items entered in field . For example if auto publishing is turned on and the maximum number is set to two items every hour then if a user manually published two content items in an hour it may be determined that no items will be auto published for the next hour. In some embodiments manually published content items may be ignored for the purpose of auto publishing content items.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with options for indicating a default link to be placed for the content to account for no link being placed in the content item. Field may allow the user to enter a default uniform resource locator URL to include in all content items that do not have a URL already. For example the user may enter a uniform resource locator associated with the user. In such an example a link containing the URL or a shortened form of the URL where appropriate may be inserted into any content item that does not already contain a link.

Checkboxes may allow a user to choose which sources may be scored and recommended for publication. In the example of sources that the user may choose from include free tweets feed tweets and retweets. In this example free tweets are content items that may be manually written by the user and feed tweets are content items that may be automatically generated from feeds or other sources entered by the user to be used to gather content. Retweets may be content from an account that is associated with another user of a social messaging service and the account may have some relationship to an account linked to the profile. For example a retweet may come from an account that is following a TWITTER account linked to the profile from a fan of a FACEBOOK page associated with the profile etc. There may also be other sources of content that a user may select to have scored and possibly recommended. For example advertisements that the user may purchase or advertisements that the user has purchased may be selected as a source.

In some embodiments the user may be provided with default publication options. Dropdown may allow a user to choose which platforms to publish to by default. For example if a user has a FACEBOOK account and a TWITTER account linked or otherwise connected to the profile the user may choose to publish to one or the other of the platforms by default to publish to both services or to neither service. This feature may be implemented as a checkbox for each linked account that allow the user the ability to publish by default to any or all of the linked accounts or any other suitable interface.

Interface may further include other settings such as for example linked accounts settings shown in as social network connections feeds that content items may be automatically generated from a field for adding a feed to feeds user access settings topics and interests settings excluded topics settings dependency settings a save option any other suitable settings and or any suitable combination thereof.

Linked accounts settings may allow a user to connect various accounts to the profile. For example the user may connect any suitable account that the user owns or has access. In another example the user may connect an account where the user has a right or permission to publish content.

Feeds may be content sources that the user or an administrative user has entered for use in generating recommended content items. Feeds may be RSS feeds XML feeds a newspaper Web site a blog a content management system CMS a thirdparty application programming interface API or any other suitable source of real time data. The process for automatically generating content items described above may mine score and or classify data from feeds to generate content items recommended for posting in accordance with some embodiments. Feeds may be associated with field that may allow a user or administrative user to enter new sources of information to add to feeds . In some embodiments any feed in feeds may be deleted by a user or an administrative user in any suitable manner such as by way of a delete button and dialog box confirming deletion. In some embodiments one or more feed s in feeds may be permanent and a user may be restricted from deleting such a feed. In some embodiments the number of feeds that a user may add may be limited to some finite number. For example each profile may be limited to ten feeds 15 feeds twenty feeds etc. In some embodiments the number of feeds that may be added are not limited to a finite number. In some embodiments the number of feeds that may be added may be associated with the size of a payment from the user for use of the profile.

User access settings may allow a user or an administrative user to grant access to the profile to one or more other users that are associated with the user or administrative user in some way. For example multiple users at the same organization may be given access to the profile or a user that works for a marketing company hired by the user may be given access to the profile.

Although particular examples of checkboxes and dropdown menus were described above there are merely illustrative. These features may be implemented in any suitable manner and the particular examples are intended to be non limiting.

Turning to an example of topics and interests settings as part of interface is shown in accordance with some embodiments. Topics and interests settings may include various topics where each topic is further defined by a number of interests . In some embodiments these topics and or interests may be used in generating a score where if a representing scored keyword vector for a content item is similar to a representing scored vector of keywords for topics or words that match with the topics and or interests the content item may be given a higher score. For example as described above a vector of representing dominant keywords derived from one or more real time sources may be created for each topic of interest a vector of keywords obtained from a content item or content snippet may be created for each content item and a vector similarity score may be calculated that indicates the proximity or distance between the topic of interest vector and the content item vector. Accordingly the closer in similarity between the two vectors results in a higher score.

In some embodiments determining whether there is a similarity between topics and or interests and the content item may include finding synonyms truncations misspellings and or other similarities to topics and or interests and also determining if there is match between any of these and the content item. In some embodiments a match to synonyms truncations misspellings and or other similarities may result in a lower score increase than an exact match to a topic and or interest . In some embodiments the number of topics may be limited. For example the number of topics may be limited to five seven ten 15 or any other suitable number. In some embodiments the number of interests associated with each topic may be limited to five seven ten or any other suitable number.

Topics and interests settings may also include a new topic option . New topic option may allow a user to add a new topic to topics and settings . New interests may be added to an existing topic by selecting a box below the topic or any other suitable means of adding a new interest. Interests may be deleted by selecting an X displayed in conjunction with the interest or any other suitable means of deleting an interest.

Excluded topics settings may include one or more excluded topics presented in a list or in a box. Excluded topics may be used to filter out content items that contain references to the excluded topics . Examples of excluded topics that may be entered in excluded topics settings may include brand names of competitors terms that are not aligned with the user s brand objectives general negative terms around the user s business or any other terms the user wants to avoid publishing. If a content item contains a match to an excluded topic the content item may have its score lowered may be automatically excluded from a list of pending items may never be automatically created may be added to a list of excluded items for possible review or any suitable combination thereof. In some embodiments determining whether there is a match between excluded topics and the content items may include finding synonyms truncations misspellings and or other similarities to excluded topics and determining if there is match between any of these and the content item. In some embodiments the proximity of excluded topics to other terms may be used to determine if there is a match to an excluded topic . For example negative terms that appear in close proximity with a brand that is owned by the user may be considered a match to excluded terms but would not be a match if the appeared elsewhere in a content item.

Turning to an example of dependency settings as part of interface is illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. As used herein a dependent profile may be a profile that has limited or restricted access to the content item generation prioritization ranking and or scoring mechanisms and may be subject to the content generation decisions and or approvals by a master profile. For example actions performed by a user of a dependent profile may remain pending until approval is received by a user of a master profile. In another example actions performed by a user of a master profile e.g. selection of a content item for publication scoring rules etc. may also be performed on content associated with a user of a dependent profile.

Dependency settings may include radio buttons and . Radio buttons may allow a user to designate whether the profile is a dependent profile where the buttons are associated with yes and no . Radio buttons may allow a user to designate which master profile s the profile depends from. In the example shown in the profile is a dependent profile the yes radio button is selected and the profile depends on master profile Fitness Demo Master the corresponding radio button is selected . In some embodiments the radio buttons and may be replaced with any suitable mechanism such as a dropdown menu checkboxes etc. In the example of only a single master profile may be selected. Alternatively in some embodiments a dependent profile may be allowed to depend from one or more master profiles. For example in the case of the owner of several vehicle dealerships where the dealerships may sell different brand names of vehicles a profile for an individual dealership may depend from a master profile associated with the owner of the dealership and a master profile of the manufacturer of the brand of vehicles. More particularly a dealer may own a TOYOTA dealership and a FORD dealership and the profile for the FORD dealership may be dependent on a master profile of the dealer and a master profile of FORD.

Navigation links may allow the user to easily navigate to view all of the profiles that the user is allowed to access. In the example of selecting Gabe Bevilacqua profiles from navigation links in interface may allow the user to see all profiles in Gabe Bevilacqua profiles that they are allowed to access. As a further example in selecting Organizations from navigation links may allow the user to see all profiles in the user s organization that the user is allowed to access. In some embodiments the user may be shown all profiles within the level of the organization selected but may not be allowed to select profiles that they are not allowed to access. In some embodiments an administrative user may select any profile within an organization and may adjust settings and perform any other actions that a user with access to the profile would be able to perform. Navigation links may also have links to settings interface and reports described below which may be given in the form of a link or as a dropdown menu from another part of the navigation links . In some embodiments navigation links may be provided in any suitable form including forward and back buttons dropdowns radio buttons etc.

Free text box may allow the user to create a new content item. For example the user may use free text box to insert a text snippet describing a piece of content and insert a link to the content. In another example the user may use free text box to insert a text snippet describing a piece of owned content and select a link to the owned content. A content item created in free text box may be saved using a save button cancelled or immediately published using publish button . In some embodiments a content item created in free text box and saved may be designated as a pending content item. In some embodiments a content item created in free text box and saved may be designated as an approved content item. In some embodiments a content item created in free text box and saved may be designated as a pending content item or as an approved content item according to the users set preferences. Once created a free content item may be ranked in conjunction with other content items from the sources selected by the user.

Sorting buttons may allow the user to sort the content items by score by date alphabetically or by any other suitable category for sorting.

Approved section may contain content items that have been approved for publishing. As described above content items may be designated as approved in various ways. For example a content item approved by a master profile may be automatically approved in a dependent profile. As another example a user may manually approve content items that are listed in pending section . As another example content items with a score over a threshold may be automatically approved.

Approved content item may be a content item that has been approved in connection with the profile in any of the various way described herein. An approved content item may be distinguished from pending content items by for example being a different color being a different shape having a different label simply being included in approved section or any other suitable manner of distinguishing approved content items from pending content items. In the example of approved content items are colored a shade of green have a label marking them as approved and are included in approved section .

Score may be displayed to the user the score that was calculated for the content item approved content items or pending content items at or recalculated at .

Pending section may contain pending content items that have been created but have not been approved for publishing. Pending content items may be content items that have not been approved. Pending content item may be distinguished from approved content items by for example being a different color being a different shape having a different label simply being included in pending section or any other suitable manner of distinguishing pending content items from approved content items . In the example of pending content items are colored a shade of gray have a label marking them as pending and are included in pending section .

Edit text box may allow a user to manually edit a content item that already exists as either an approved content item or a pending content item . For example the user may be provided with a content item that includes a title or heading a text snippet that describes the content within the content item etc. The accompanying text or text snippet that has been automatically generated can be edited by the user e.g. to add a personal reflection of the content to add a comment relating to the content etc. . Edit text box may include save and cancel options that may allow the user to save the newly edited form of the content item or cancel the edit and revert to the unedited form of the content item.

Publish buttons may allow the user to manually publish a content item to a selected account. For example publish buttons may be present in association with all content items with free text box with edit text box and or with any content item that the user has focused on by for example hovering over the location of the content item with a pointing device. In some embodiments publish buttons may be shown for any accounts linked to the profile. In some embodiments publish buttons may be shown but grayed out for account types that are not linked to the profile. Selecting a publish button associated with a content item may cause that content item to be published to the account associated with the selected publish button .

Time stamp may display the time that the content item was created by the user or if the content item was automatically created or recommended the time when the content was originally published. Each content item may have a time stamp associated with it.

Source identification may display the source that was used to generate a content item or the immediate source of the content item. For example if a content item was automatically generated from a feed in feeds source identification may identify the name or title of the feed that was the source of the content item. As another example if a content item was approved by a master profile source identification may identify the name of the master profile that approved the content item. As another example if a content item was created using free text box source identification may identify that the free text box was used for example by identifying the username of the user that created the content item or by identifying the dashboard as the source of the content item. As another example if a retweet is used as the source of a content item source identification may identify social media as the source of the content item or may identify the username attached to the account that was the source of the content item.

Checkbox may allow a user to turn the auto publish feature on and off without the need to access settings interface .

Turning to an illustrative example of a user approving a pending content item is shown in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments a user may select pending content item shown in for approval in various ways which may include selecting anywhere in the box containing the score for the content item selecting approved from a dropdown selecting an approved radio button etc. After a user selects pending content item for approval it may become approved content item in approved section as shown in the example of . In some embodiments the reverse process may also be performed to move an approved content item to pending section . In either case in some embodiments a newly moved content item such as may be filled with a color for a specified period of time after moving to make it easier for the user to locate the newly created message among other content items. In some embodiments the specified period of time may be set at a default value such as two second five second etc. or may be set by the user in settings interface .

An example of a graphical summary is shown in graphical area of in accordance with some embodiments. Engagement generated for each account may be represented by a separate line in graphical area where engagement is a measure of how much activity a given content item generated in relation to each account. For example regarding TWITTER engagement a click on a link a retweet and a new follower may each count as one engagement where engagements may include anything that may measure engagement of a user base with the content item. For example impressions or views to the extent that they may be measured may be included as engagement where an impression may count the same or less than another type of engagement. Taking FACEBOOK as an example likes of a content message new fans likes of a page views or impressions of a page etc. may count as engagements.

In some embodiments a user may choose which networks to view a report for by selecting a network or networks with account buttons . For each network selected a separate graphic element will be shown in graphical area showing engagement over time. In some embodiments total engagement may be shown with a separate graphic element where total engagement is the sum of engagement for each individual account at each measured moment in time e.g. engagement may be plotted separately for each day .

In some embodiments the number of content items published is displayed by showing an object where the size of the object any proportional to the number of content items published. In some embodiments the size of the object may be linearly related to the number of content items published. In some embodiments the size of the object may be proportional in some other way such that very large numbers of content items being published does not make the object dominate the graphical area. In the example shown in the object is a portion of a circle but any object could be used for example a silhouette of a bird a letter etc.

Detail area may display information related to each content item that was published over the time period specified in field . In some embodiments this information may include the date and time of publication the accounts that the information was published to the content item as published engagement totals for each account type total engagement across all accounts where the content item was posted clicks on a link in the content item over time or any combination of these.

Selecting any of summary buttons and may cause a textual summary of the data to be displayed for the corresponding accounts over the time period specified in field . An example of a textual summary displayed in response to selection of summary button is shown in . In some embodiments the textual summary may be displayed overlaid on interface . In some embodiments the textual summary may be displayed on a separate area or in a new page or screen.

In some embodiments reports on engagement may be generated based on information available from the services associated with various accounts on which content items are published. In some embodiments additional information may be gathered by shortening any URLs in a content item to a shortened URL that directs to a service provider domain where it is then redirected to the final destination of the link. This may allow the service provider to track how many times the shortened URL was clicked by measuring the number of times an incoming request from a shortened URL was rerouted to the final destination. In some embodiments the total number of clicks is measured whereas in some embodiments the number of unique Internet Protocol addresses IP addresses that requested the final destination from the service provider s domain are tracked. Any other suitable form of click tracking may be used.

In some embodiments engagement may be tracked by attaching a unique identifier to content items. This may allow a service provider that causes the unique identifier to be attached to content items to track the dissemination of the content items and further refine the recommendations based on who is further disseminating the content items with the attached unique identifiers.

In some embodiments content items may be advertisements created in at least one of the following ways created by the user automatically generated from content sources such as feeds or from content published by others created by advertisers or any other suitable manner of generating advertisements. In the case of automatically generating advertisements in some embodiments this may be done by a process similar to the process for automatically generating content items described above in connection with the example of where advertisements may be specifically targeted at specific groups and may purposely include the name of the user s organization.

It should be noted that although the embodiments described herein generally relate to generating prioritizing scoring and or publishing content items this is merely illustrative. Similarly to the case of content items advertisements may be scored based on the likelihood of engagement with the advertisement and or relevance. These scores may be combined with other recommendations based on a target audience of the user. In some embodiments content items that were originally created for another purpose may be recommended to be converted into advertisements based on the content item having a very high score and thereby a high likelihood of engagement. In some embodiments the information gathered about engagement of non advertisement content items may be used to refine the scores for advertising content items. In some embodiments information reported by an advertisement provider about past advertisements may be used to refine the scores for advertising content items and give a more accurate prediction of the likelihood of engagement for any given advertising content item. In some embodiments the information on engagement may be used to enhance the placement of advertising content items based on the content of the advertising content item the target audience time of day or part of day price or bid amount etc.

In some embodiments advertisements may be tailored to the specific platform where the advertisement is intended to be displayed. For example advertisements being displayed on FACEBOOK may have different size limitations and other advertisement characteristics than advertisements appearing on TWITTER LINKEDIN or GOOGLE. Likewise the use of images may be limited to various degrees on different advertisement platforms. In some embodiments various versions of an advertisement may be created either automatically or manually based on the limitations of various advertising platforms. In some embodiments a user using a profile to place advertisements may link the profile to various advertising accounts with various advertising providers.

In some embodiments engagement information related to non advertisement content items advertising content items and other content items related to the may be combined to give an overall impression of the effectiveness of an advertising and or outreach campaign.

Although the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative embodiments it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is limited only by the claims that follow. Features of the disclosed embodiments may be combined and rearranged in various ways.

It will also be understood that the detailed description herein may be presented in terms of program procedures executed on a computer or network of computers. These procedural descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.

A procedure is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. These steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It proves convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like. It should be noted however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.

Further the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms such as adding or comparing which are commonly associated with mental operations performed by a human operator. No such capability of a human operator is necessary or desirable in most cases in any of the operations described herein which form part of the present invention the operations are machine operations. Useful machines for performing the operation of the present invention include general purpose digital computers or similar devices.

The mechanism described herein also relates to apparatus for performing these operations. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purpose or it may comprise a general purpose computer as selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. The procedures presented herein are not inherently related to a particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose machines may be used with programs written in accordance with the disclosure herein or it may prove more convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these machines will appear from the description given.
