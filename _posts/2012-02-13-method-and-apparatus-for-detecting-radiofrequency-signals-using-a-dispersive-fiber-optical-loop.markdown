Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to radio frequency communications and more particularly to a method and apparatus for detecting radio frequency signals using a dispersive fiber optical loop.

Typically public radio frequency RF communications are transmitted at a set frequency so that a receiver can tune to the particular frequency and receive the communications. In contrast private communications are transmitted across multiple frequencies e.g. using frequency hopping and or spread spectrum techniques . In some instances these private communications need to be captured by unintended receivers e.g. law enforcement agencies military organizations and the like. However difficulties arise when the communications are transmitted across various frequencies i.e. frequency hopping is employed in the form of short RF pulses each broadcast on a different frequency.

Without knowing the frequency hopping pattern a receiver must attempt to capture all signals in the relevant band. Typically all the signals within the band are digitized and then processed using a very high speed digital signal processing DSP system. Such high speed DSP systems are very costly to manufacture operate and maintain. In some instances the band of interest is divided into sub bands and each sub band is digitized and processed in a corresponding DSP. Such sub band channelization enables many signals to be quickly processed in parallel using less expensive DSP circuits i.e. lower speed circuits . However even a channelized broad band receiver is very expensive to manufacture operate and maintain.

Recently optical systems have found use in broad band signal processing wherein the received RF signals are used to modulate a light signal and the light signal is processed using optical signal processing. Such techniques unfortunately are prone to noise and system instability.

Therefore there is a need in the art for an improved method and apparatus for detecting radio frequency signals using optical techniques.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to an apparatus comprising a dispersive fiber optical loop for delaying a first and second sideband relative to each other of a laser modulated by a radio frequency signal to create a pair of pulses. A coupler taps a replica of the pair of pulses from the loop. An auto correlation module coupled to the coupler correlates the replica of the pair of pulses with each other producing data points. Each transit around the loop produces an additional replica of the pair of pulses with an augmented delay between them. A Fast Fourier Transform FFT module performs an FFT on the data points to obtain a channelized frequency spectrum representing the radio frequency signal.

Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method modulating a light with a RF input signal to produce a modulated light with a first and second sideband generating a pulse from the modulated light inputting the pulse into a dispersive fiber optical loop to generate a delay between the first and second sideband relative to each other tapping a plurality of time delayed replicas of the pulse from the loop photo detecting the time delayed replicas to generate a plurality of RF signal pairs correlating the plurality of RF signal pairs by correlating each first signal in the pair with a second signal in the pair generating and storing data points based on the correlating performing a Fast Fourier Transform on the plurality of stored data points to generate a frequency spectrum.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise a method and apparatus for detecting radio frequency signals using a dispersive fiber optical loop. Light from a laser is modulated using a received RF signal which is comprised of multiple frequencies producing two sidebands. The modulated light is converted into a pulse of light. The pulse circulates through the dispersive optical loop a finite number of times. The dispersive nature of the loop causes the pulse containing both sideband frequencies to propagate through the loop at different speeds for each sideband. As such after one pass through the loop there are two pulses each representing a different sideband. For every cycle the pulses take through the fiber a replica pulse pair is tapped from the loop. The tapped pulse pair is photo detected to create an RF signal the sidebands in the pulse pair are correlated with each other within an RF mixer filtered and then digitized. Once the loop has run multiple times a Fast Fourier transform FFT is performed on the accumulated digitized signals data points to generate a channelized frequency spectrum representing information carried by the received RF signals.

The RF input signal may be received via a conventional RF front end not shown comprising for example an antenna low noise amplifier and various filters. The choice of components and arrangement depends upon the nature of the signals that are to be processed. The selection of components and their arrangement is a design choice capable of being made by anyone with skill in the RF communication arts.

The optical modulator frequency modulates light from the laser with the RF input signal creating an RF modulated light wave. According to an exemplary embodiment the laser is a continuous wave laser providing light of frequency f. Also according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the optical modulator is a Mach Zehnder modulator. The sidebands created by the optical modulator are separated from the light frequency by the frequencies of the RF signals. For example if an RF input signal has a frequency of 1 GHz sidebands would be located at f 1 GHz and f 1 GHz.

The optical gate switch converts the modulated light into an optical pulse. Optionally after the switch and before entry into the loop at switch a 1 2 coupler is used to send the pulse signal to another loop. Loops can be cascaded so that pulse signal is multiplexed in the time domain to many copies of apparatus for processing longer pulses. Alternatively a 1 n switch is coupled to the gate switch with each output of the 1 n switch connected a recirculating fiber loop of differing lengths allowing an operator of apparatus to select a desired bandwidth for the system.

Once the gate switch generates an optical pulse the pulse enters the beginning portion of the fiber optic recirculating dispersion loop . In an exemplary embodiment the fiber optical dispersion loop is 10 km in length and is fabricated of the SMF 28 ULL fiber from Corning Incorporated of Corning N.Y. The loop is recirculating because the loop enables the pulse to circle around and re enter the switch to introduce a time delay caused by dispersive properties of the loop . Once the pulse enters the switch the switch closes so further pulses cannot enter the loop causing distortion and noise. A single pulse enters the loop. This single pulse comprises frequency components of both side bands. The dispersive nature of the loop causes each side band to propagate through the loop at a different speed. Consequently a delay is created between the side bands that creates the two pulses separated by a delay n t where n is the number of times the pulse has circled the loop and t is the time delay formed during a cycle through the loop. According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention the gate switch is coupled to a plurality of cascaded fiber optical loops not shown for processing longer pulses. In one embodiment each of these loops is of a different length determining the frequency band the loops can process.

The loop comprises a coupler that taps a replica of the pulse for further processing discussed below. In another embodiment of the present invention the switch and the coupler are combined as a 2 2 coupler with a first input for the high contrast gate switch a second input for the loop a first output to tap replica pulses and a second output coupled to the isolator .

The pulse signal that remains suffers a signal loss i.e. coupling loss so it is coupled to an isolator and an optical amplifier in the loop . According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the optical amplifier is an Erbium doped fiber amplifier. The optical amplifier amplifies the pulse to compensate for the coupling loss. Often an optical amplifier produces reflective pulses thus the isolator is coupled to the loop prevents these reflections from causing interference in the loop . The fiber optical loop is then coupled to an optical filter at the laser wavelength to filter any noise generated by the amplifier . The loop is coupled to the isolator for isolating any reflections from the switch . In an exemplary embodiment a polarization rotator is inserted before the coupler to maximize coupling efficiency. In addition an optional second polarization rotator is used in the loop to allow minimization of polarization dependent effects by not allowing devices in the loop to have polarization dependent loss or gain i.e. the polarization rotators randomize the polarization of the light propagating in the loop .

The pulse which becomes a pulse pair while in the loop travels around the loop multiple times with a replica of the pulse tapped out each time. Due to the dispersion in the fiber one sideband of the pulse travels slower than the other sideband. The difference in travel time is denoted by t so each loop introduces an additive delay n t where n is the current loop iteration between the sidebands in each successive pulse pair replica. Regular optical fiber causes the spreading apart of optical pulses i.e. dispersion by approximately wavelength . For the nth pulse pair the t between the two pulses will be n t as discussed above where

Here L is the loop length and are the modulation sideband wavelengths and Sis a constant from the dispersion relation intrinsic to the optical fiber. For the Corning s SMF 28 ULL fiber Sis 0.092 ps nmkm although other dispersive fibers can be used.

The tapped pulse pair replicas are coupled to an optional optical amplifier that amplifies the signal for the photodetector . The photodetector converts the optical pulse sidebands to a pair of RF pulses. The photo detector is coupled to an auto correlation module . In one embodiment auto correlation module comprises an optional RF amplifier that amplifies the RF signal created by the photodetector an RF mixing element and an RF filter . For the npulse pair the two pulse signals are represented as A cos t and B cos t n t where A and B are the RF sideband signal amplitudes is the angular frequency of the RF input signal and tis the time. In an exemplary embodiment a portion of output power from the loop before going to the photodetector is used as a negative feedback control for a servo for altering amplification of the amplifier preventing over and under amplification and compensating for drift in the loop .

The RF signals are sent to an RF mixing element to multiply together each pulse pair. This is known as an auto correlation function. In an exemplary embodiment a square law detector is used as the RF mixing element . The RF mixing element integrates many pulses over time. The pulse pairs are auto correlated to help in finding the presence of repeating patterns and periodic signals in the RF input . An optional RF filter filters the high band frequencies i.e. a low pass filter yielding just a baseband signal cos n t and the DC signal. A DC block may be used to filter out the DC signal. The baseband signal is coupled to an ADC such that each replicated pulse pair yields a data point for autocorrelation with a different delay between the sidebands. These points are stored in memory as data points .

A controller synchronizes the opening and closing of the gate switch the switch and the ADC as well as routing to any additional loops mentioned in the optional configurations. The controller comprises memory and a processor coupled to the memory . The memory stores an FFT module and data points . In an exemplary embodiment the memory may include one or more of the following random access memory read only memory magneto resistive read write memory optical read write memory cache memory magnetic read write memory and the like as well as signal bearing media not including non transitory signals such as carrier waves and the like.

The FFT module performs an FFT on the data points from the ADC to generate a channelized frequency spectrum. In the present invention t is not constant and is dependent on the frequency of the RF input . The loop enables the apparatus to create a linear dependency between the t and RF input frequency. In this manner the baseband signal cos n t can be rewritten cos nC where C is a constant dependent on the dispersion properties of the loop . The FFT module converts data points from the time domain to the frequency squared domain from which the frequency data is obtained using well known signal processing techniques.

At step the sideband pulse replica pairs are photo detected to generate RF signals and then correlated with each other at step . The two sidebands have a time delay between them due to the dispersion in the fiber optical loop. At step data points are generated by the ADC to digitize the auto correlation. The digitized data points are stored at step in memory . At step the method determines whether N points have been stored. If N points have not been stored the method returns to step to tap more pulses from the loop . If N points have been stored the FFT module performs a FFT on the N points to generate a frequency domain spectrum at step . At step it is determined whether a new pulse should enter the loop. If so the method proceeds to step of modulating light from a laser with an RF input. If there are no more pulses the method ends at step . According to an exemplary embodiments N 500 1000 or the like.
