The present invention relates to fungicidal alkyl or aryl substituted 2 2 chloro 4 dihalo phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol compounds and the N oxides and the salts thereof for combating phytopathogenic fungi and to the use and methods for combating phytopathogenic fungi and to seeds coated with at least one such compound. The invention also relates to processes for preparing these compounds and to compositions comprising at least one such compound.

Certain alkyl or aryl substituted 2 2 chloro 4 4 halogen phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol compounds of formula

The compounds according to the present invention differ from those described in the abovemention publications inter alia by adding at least one further halogen substituent in ortho position to the phenoxy group as defined herein.

In many cases in particular at low application rates the fungicidal activity of the known fungicidal compounds is unsatisfactory. Based on this it was an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity and or a broader activity spectrum against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

This object is achieved by alkyl and aryl substituted 2 2 chloro 4 dihalo phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol compounds having good fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

The present invention furthermore relates to the use of these compounds for combating harmful fungi and seed coated with at least one such compound and also to compositions comprising at least one such compound of formula I.

The present invention furthermore relates to processes for preparing compounds of formula I and to intermediates such as compounds of formulae IV V Va VII and XI.

The term compounds I refers to compounds of formula I. Likewise this terminology applies to all sub formulae e.g. compounds I.A refers to compounds of formula I.A or compounds XI refers to compounds of formula XI etc.

The compounds I can be obtained by various routes in analogy to prior art processes known cf. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009 57 4854 4860 EP 0 275 955 A1 DE 40 03 180 A1 EP 0 113 640 A2 EP 0 126 430 A2 and by the synthesis routes shown in the following schemes and in the experimental part of this application.

In a first process for example halo phenoles II wherein X Xand Xare as defined herein are reacted in a first step with derivatives IIIIc 

In a second process to obtain compounds I bromo derivatives III in a first step are reacted with e.g. isopropylmagnesium bromide followed by an acyl chloride agent IX wherein Ris as defined above e.g. acetyl chloride preferably under anhydrous conditions and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as CuCl AlCl LiCl and mixtures thereof to obtain compounds X. Alternatively 1 3 dichlorobenzene of formula IIIb can be reacted with an acyl chloride agent IX wherein Ris as defined above e.g. acetyl chloride preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as AlCl. Then ketones X are reacted with phenoles II preferably in the presence of a base to obtain compounds Va.

Thereafter intermediates Va are reacted with trimethylsulf ox onium halides preferably iodide preferably in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. Thereafter the epoxides XI are reacted with 1H 1 2 4 triazole preferably in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and preferably in the presence of an organic solvent such as DMF to obtain compounds I A which can subsequently be alkylated as described above. The preparation of compounds I.A can be illustrated by the following scheme 

In a third process the epoxide ring of intermediates XI which may be obtained according to the second process described herein is cleaved by reaction with alcohols ROH preferably under acidic conditions. Thereafter the resulting compounds XII are reacted with halogenating agents or sulfonating agents such as PBr PCl mesyl chloride tosyl chloride or thionyl chloride to obtain compounds XIII wherein LG is a nucleophilically replaceable leaving group such as halogen alkylsulfonyl alkylsulfonyloxy and arylsulfonyloxy preferably chloro bromo or iodo particularly preferably bromo or alkylsulfonyl. Then compounds XIII are reacted with 1H 1 2 4 triazole to obtain compounds I. The preparation of compounds I can be illustrated by the following scheme 

If individual compounds I cannot be obtained by the routes described above they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.

The N oxides may be prepared from the compounds I according to conventional oxidation methods e.g. by treating compounds I with an organic peracid such as metachloroperbenzoic acid cf. WO 03 64572 or J. Med. Chem. 38 11 1892 903 1995 or with inorganic oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide cf. J. Heterocyc. Chem. 18 7 1305 8 1981 or oxone cf. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123 25 5962 5973 2001 . The oxidation may lead to pure mono N oxides or to a mixture of different N oxides which can be separated by conventional methods such as chromatography.

If the synthesis yields mixtures of isomers a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be interconverted during workup for use or during application e.g. under the action of light acids or bases . Such conversions may also take place after use e.g. in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus to be controlled.

The term cultivated plants is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development cf. http www.bio.org speeches pubs er agri products.asp . Genetically modified plants are plants which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding mutations or natural recombination. Typically one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post translational modification of protein s oligo or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.

Plants that have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2 4 D bleacher herbicides such as hydroxyl phenylpyruvate dioxygenase HPPD inhibitors or phytoene desaturase PDS inhibittors acetolactate synthase ALS inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase EPSPS inhibitors such as glyphosate glutamine synthetase GS inhibitors such as glufosinate protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase inhibitors lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase ACCase inhibitors or oxynil i.e. bromoxynil or ioxynil herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors HPPD inhibitors auxin herbicides or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e.g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61 2005 246 61 2005 258 61 2005 277 61 2005 269 61 2005 286 64 2008 326 64 2008 332 Weed Sci. 57 2009 108 Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58 2007 708 Science 316 2007 1185 and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding mutagenesis e.g. Clearfield summer rape Canola BASF SE Germany being tolerant to imidazolinones e.g. imazamox or ExpressSun sunflowers DuPont USA being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas e.g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean cotton corn beets and rape tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady glyphosate tolerant Monsanto U.S.A. Cultivance imidazolinone tolerant BASF SE Germany and LibertyLink glufosinate tolerant Bayer CropScience Germany .
