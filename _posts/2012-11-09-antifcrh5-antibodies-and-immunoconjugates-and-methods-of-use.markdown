The present invention is directed to compositions of matter useful for the treatment of hematopoietic tumor in mammals and to methods of using those compositions of matter for the same.

Malignant tumors cancers are the second leading cause of death in the United States after heart disease Boring et al. 43 7 1993 . Cancer is characterized by the increase in the number of abnormal or neoplastic cells derived from a normal tissue which proliferate to form a tumor mass the invasion of adjacent tissues by these neoplastic tumor cells and the generation of malignant cells which eventually spread via the blood or lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites via a process called metastasis. In a cancerous state a cell proliferates under conditions in which normal cells would not grow. Cancer manifests itself in a wide variety of forms characterized by different degrees of invasiveness and aggressiveness.

Cancers which involve cells generated during hematopoiesis a process by which cellular elements of blood such as lymphocytes leukocytes platelets erythrocytes and natural killer cells are generated are referred to as hematopoietic cancers. Lymphocytes which can be found in blood and lymphatic tissue and are critical for immune response are categorized into two main classes of lymphocytes B lymphocytes B cells and T lymphocytes T cells which mediate humoral and cell mediated immunity respectively.

B cells mature within the bone marrow and leave the marrow expressing an antigen binding antibody on their cell surface. When a naive B cell first encounters the antigen for which its membrane bound antibody is specific the cell begins to divide rapidly and its progeny differentiate into memory B cells and effector cells called plasma cells . Memory B cells have a longer life span and continue to express membrane bound antibody with the same specificity as the original parent cell. Plasma cells do not produce membrane bound antibody but instead produce the antibody in a form that can be secreted. Secreted antibodies are the major effector molecule of humoral immunity.

T cells mature within the thymus which provides an environment for the proliferation and differentiation of immature T cells. During T cell maturation the T cells undergo the gene rearrangements that produce the T cell receptor and the positive and negative selection which helps determine the cell surface phenotype of the mature T cell. Characteristic cell surface markers of mature T cells are the CD3 T cell receptor complex and one of the coreceptors CD4 or CD8.

In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer therapy researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise membrane associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type s of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non cancerous cell s . Often such membrane associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody based therapies. In this regard it is noted that antibody based therapy has proved very effective in the treatment of certain cancers. For example HERCEPTIN and RITUXAN both from Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. are antibodies that have been used successfully to treat breast cancer and non Hodgkin s lymphoma respectively. More specifically HERCEPTIN is a recombinant DNA derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 proto oncogene. HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 25 30 of primary breast cancers. RITUXAN is a genetically engineered chimeric murine human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Both these antibodies are recombinantly produced in CHO cells.

In other attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer therapy researchers have sought to identify 1 non membrane associated polypeptides that are specifically produced by one or more particular type s of cancer cell s as compared to by one or more particular type s of non cancerous normal cell s 2 polypeptides that are produced by cancer cells at an expression level that is significantly higher than that of one or more normal non cancerous cell s or 3 polypeptides whose expression is specifically limited to only a single or very limited number of different tissue type s in both the cancerous and non cancerous state e.g. normal prostate and prostate tumor tissue . Such polypeptides may remain intracellularly located or may be secreted by the cancer cell. Moreover such polypeptides may be expressed not by the cancer cell itself but rather by cells which produce and or secrete polypeptides having a potentiating or growth enhancing effect on cancer cells. Such secreted polypeptides are often proteins that provide cancer cells with a growth advantage over normal cells and include such things as for example angiogenic factors cellular adhesion factors growth factors and the like. Identification of antagonists of such non membrane associated polypeptides would be expected to serve as effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of such cancers. Furthermore identification of the expression pattern of such polypeptides would be useful for the diagnosis of particular cancers in mammals.

Despite the above identified advances in mammalian cancer therapy there is a great need for additional therapeutic agents capable of detecting the presence of tumor in a mammal and for effectively inhibiting neoplastic cell growth respectively. Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to identify polypeptides cell membrane associated secreted or intracellular polypeptides whose expression is specifically limited to only a single or very limited number of different tissue type s hematopoietic tissues in both a cancerous and non cancerous state and to use those polypeptides and their encoding nucleic acids to produce compositions of matter useful in the therapeutic treatment and or detection of hematopoietic cancer in mammals.

Abnormalities of chromosome 1q21 are common in B cell malignancies including B cell lymphoma and myeloma but the genes targeted by these aberrations are largely unknown. Chromosomal abnormalities involving band 1q21 q23 are among the most frequent genetic lesions in both B cell non Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Among non Hodgkin s lymphoma subtypes translocation breakpoints at 1q21 q23 including translocations and duplications have been reported often as the single chromosomal abnormality in follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLCL in marginal zone B cell lymphoma and in Burkitt lymphoma. By cloning the breakpoints of a t 1 14 q21 q32 chromosomal translocation in a myeloma cell line two genes were identified termed immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation associated IRTA 1 and IRTA2. IRTA2 is identical to sequences identified as BXMAS1 Nakayama et al. Biochm. Biophys. Res. Commun. 285 830 7 2001 and FcRH5 Davis et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 9772 7 2001 . Both IRTA1 and IRTA2 are members of a family of related genes the IRTA.

FcRH5 or IRTA2 is a cell surface receptor with homologies to the Fc receptor families. It is normally expressed in mature B cells and has a different distribution in peripheral lymphoid organs than FcRH4 IRTA1 . IRTA1 is expressed in marginal zone B cells while IRTA2 is also expressed in germinal center centrocytes and in immunoblasts. IRTA2 expression is deregulated in multiple myeloma and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with 1q21 abnormalities see Miller et al. Blood 99 2662 2669 2002 . The high frequency of involvement of 1q21 structural rearrangements in B cell malignancies suggests that IRTA1 and IRTA2 are critical to the pathogenesis of these diseases see published PCT Application No. WO 01 38490 U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20080292632 see also Polson et al. Int Immunol. 2006 September 18 9 1363 73 .

Given the expression of FcRH5 it is beneficial to produce therapeutic antibodies to the FcRH5 antigen that create minimal or no antigenicity when administered to patients especially for chronic treatment. The present invention satisfies this and other needs. The present invention provides anti FcRH5 antibodies that overcome the limitations of current therapeutic compositions as well as offer additional advantages that will be apparent from the detailed description below.

The use of antibody drug conjugates ADC i.e. immunoconjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Lambert J. 2005 Curr. Opinion in Pharmacology 5 543 549 Wu et al 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1137 1146 Payne G. 2003 Cancer Cell 3 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 Anticancer Research 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al ed.s pp. 475 506 . Efforts to improve the therapeutic index i.e. maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity of ADC have focused on the selectivity of polyclonal Rowland et al 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 and monoclonal antibodies mAbs as well as drug linking and drug releasing properties Lambert J. 2005 Curr. Opinion in Pharmacology 5 543 549 . Drug moieties used in antibody drug conjugates include bacterial protein toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant protein toxins such as ricin small molecules such as auristatins geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 J. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad.

The drug moieties may affect cytotoxic and cytostatic mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Conventional means of attaching i.e. linking through covalent bonds a drug moiety to an antibody generally leads to a heterogeneous mixture of molecules where the drug moieties are attached at a number of sites on the antibody. For example cytotoxic drugs have typically been conjugated to antibodies through the often numerous lysine residues of an antibody generating a heterogeneous antibody drug conjugate mixture. Depending on reaction conditions the heterogeneous mixture typically contains a distribution of antibodies with from 0 to about 8 or more attached drug moieties. In addition within each subgroup of conjugates with a particular integer ratio of drug moieties to antibody is a potentially heterogeneous mixture where the drug moiety is attached at various sites on the antibody. Analytical and preparative methods may be inadequate to separate and characterize the antibody drug conjugate species molecules within the heterogeneous mixture resulting from a conjugation reaction. Antibodies are large complex and structurally diverse biomolecules often with many reactive functional groups. Their reactivities with linker reagents and drug linker intermediates are dependent on factors such as pH concentration salt concentration and co solvents. Furthermore the multistep conjugation process may be nonreproducible due to difficulties in controlling the reaction conditions and characterizing reactants and intermediates.

Cysteine thiols are reactive at neutral pH unlike most amines which are protonated and less nucleophilic near pH 7. Since free thiol RSH sulfhydryl groups are relatively reactive proteins with cysteine residues often exist in their oxidized form as disulfide linked oligomers or have internally bridged disulfide groups. Extracellular proteins generally do not have free thiols Garman 1997 Non Radioactive Labelling A Practical Approach Academic Press London at page 55 . Antibody cysteine thiol groups are generally more reactive i.e. more nucleophilic towards electrophilic conjugation reagents than antibody amine or hydroxyl groups. Cysteine residues have been introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachments to ligands or to form new intramolecular disulfide bonds Better et al 1994 J. Biol. Chem. 13 9644 9650 Bernhard et al 1994 Bioconjugate Chem. 5 126 132 Greenwood et al 1994 Therapeutic Immunology 1 247 255 Tu et al 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 4862 4867 Kanno et al 2000 J. of Biotechnology 76 207 214 Chmura et al 2001 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 98 15 8480 8484 U.S. Pat. No. 6 248 564 . However engineering in cysteine thiol groups by the mutation of various amino acid residues of a protein to cysteine amino acids is potentially problematic particularly in the case of unpaired free Cys residues or those which are relatively accessible for reaction or oxidation. In concentrated solutions of the protein whether in the periplasm of culture supernatants or partially or completely purified protein unpaired Cys residues on the surface of the protein can pair and oxidize to form intermolecular disulfides and hence protein dimers or multimers. Disulfide dimer formation renders the new Cys unreactive for conjugation to a drug ligand or other label. Furthermore if the protein oxidatively forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between the newly engineered Cys and an existing Cys residue both Cys thiol groups are unavailable for active site participation and interactions. Furthermore the protein may be rendered inactive or non specific by misfolding or loss of tertiary structure Zhang et al 2002 Anal. Biochem. 311 1 9 .

Cysteine engineered antibodies have been designed as FAB antibody fragments thioFab and expressed as full length IgG monoclonal thioMab antibodies Junutula J. R. et al. 2008 J Immunol Methods 332 41 52 US 2007 0092940 the contents of which are incorporated by reference . ThioFab and ThioMab antibodies have been conjugated through linkers at the newly introduced cysteine thiols with thiol reactive linker reagents and drug linker reagents to prepare antibody drug conjugates Thio ADC .

The B cell surface marker of particular interest is preferentially expressed on B cells compared to other non B cell tissues of a mammal and may be expressed on both precursor B cells and mature B cells.

The term FcRH5 as used herein refers to any native FcRH5 from any vertebrate source including mammals such as primates e.g. humans cynomologus monkey cyno and rodents .e.g. mice and rats unless otherwise indicated. Human FcRH5 is also referred herein to as TAHO18 or PRO85143 SEQ ID NO 2 and encoded by the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO 1 also referred herein to as DNA340394 . Cynomologus FcRH5 is also referred herein to as cyno FcRH5 . The term FcRH5 encompasses full length unprocessed FcRH5 as well as any form of FcRH5 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of FcRH5 e.g. splice variants allelic variants and isoforms. The FcRH5 polypeptides described herein may be isolated from a variety of sources such as from human tissue types or from another source or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. A native sequence FcRH5 polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the corresponding FcRH5 polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence FcRH5 polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term native sequence FcRH5 polypeptide specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms of the specific FcRH5 polypeptide e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants of the polypeptide. In certain embodiments of the invention the native sequence FcRH5 polypeptides disclosed herein are mature or full length native sequence polypeptides comprising the full length amino acids sequences shown in the accompanying figures. Start and stop codons if indicated are shown in bold font and underlined in the figures. Nucleic acid residues indicated as N in the accompanying figures are any nucleic acid residue. However while the FcRH5 polypeptides disclosed in the accompanying figures are shown to begin with methionine residues designated herein as amino acid position 1 in the figures it is conceivable and possible that other methionine residues located either upstream or downstream from the amino acid position 1 in the figures may be employed as the starting amino acid residue for the FcRH5 polypeptides.

 mu7D11 or MA7D11 or murine FcRH5 7D11 antibody or murine anti FcRH5 7D11 antibody is used herein to specifically refer to murine anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibody wherein the murine anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibody comprises the light chain variable domain of SEQ ID NO 18 and SEQ ID NO 20 . Murine anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibody may be purchased from commercial sources.

 ch13G9 or chMAFcRH5 13G9 or chimeric MAFcRH5 13G9 antibody is used herein to specifically refer to chimeric anti human FcRH5 13G antibody wherein the chimeric anti FcRH5 antibody comprises the light chain of SEQ ID NO 53 which comprises the light chain constant domain of human IgG1. The chimeric anti FcRH5 13G9 antibody further comprises the heavy chain of SEQ ID NO 55 which comprises the constant domain of human IgG1.

 13G9 graft or 13G9 grafted humanized antibody or hu13G9 graft is used herein to specifically refer to the graft generated by grafting the hypervariable regions from murine 13G9 anti FcRH5 antibody MA7D11 into the acceptor human consensus VL kappa I huKI and human subgroup III consensus VH huIII with R71A N73T and L78A Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 See Example section 1 and . hu13G9 or hu13G9 v1 or hu13G9 v3 or hu13G9 v8 is used herein to specifically refer to humanized 13G9 antibody.

A modification of an amino acid residue position as used herein refers to a change of a primary amino acid sequence as compared to a starting amino acid sequence wherein the change results from a sequence alteration involving said amino acid residue positions. For example typical modifications include substitution of the residue or at said position with another amino acid e.g. a conservative or non conservative substitution insertion of one or more generally fewer than 5 or 3 amino acids adjacent to said residue position and deletion of said residue position. An amino acid substitution or variation thereof refers to the replacement of an existing amino acid residue in a predetermined starting amino acid sequence with a different amino acid residue. Generally and preferably the modification results in alteration in at least one physicobiochemical activity of the variant polypeptide compared to a polypeptide comprising the starting or wild type amino acid sequence. For example in the case of an antibody a physicobiochemical activity that is altered can be binding affinity binding capability and or binding effect upon a target molecule.

The term antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers for example single anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibodies including agonist antagonist neutralizing antibodies full length or intact monoclonal antibodies anti FcRH5 antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity formed from at least two intact antibodies single chain anti FcRH5 antibodies and fragments of anti FcRH5 antibodies see below including Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies single domain antibodies sdAbs as long as they exhibit the desired biological or immunological activity. The term immunoglobulin Ig is used interchangeable with antibody herein. An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

The term anti FcRH5 antibody or an antibody that binds to FcRH5 refers to an antibody that is capable of binding FcRH5 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting FcRH5. Preferably the extent of binding of an anti FcRH5 antibody to an unrelated non FcRH5 protein is less than about 10 of the binding of the antibody to FcRH5 as measured e.g. by a radioimmunoassay RIA . In certain embodiments an antibody that binds to FcRH5 has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM or 0.1 nM. In certain embodiments anti FcRH5 antibody binds to an epitope of FcRH5 that is conserved among FcRH5 from different species.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The basic 4 chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2 5 of the basic 4 chain units along with J chain . In the case of IgGs the 4 chain unit is generally about 150 000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to a H chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by three constant domains C for each of the and chains and four Cdomains for a and c isotypes. Each L chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by a constant domain C at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain C1 . Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies see e.g. 8th edition Daniel P. Stites Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow eds. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. 1994 page 71 and Chapter 6.

The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains C immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM having heavy chains designated and respectively. The and classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function e.g. humans express the following subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2.

The variable region or variable domain of an antibody refers to the amino terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as VH. The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as VL. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen binding sites.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110 amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions FRs of 15 30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called hypervariable regions that are each 9 12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a 3 sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

An intact antibody is one which comprises an antigen binding site as well as a Cand at least heavy chain constant domains C1 C2 and C3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.

A naked antibody for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies see U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 Example 2 Zapata et al. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments and a residual Fc fragment a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain V and the first constant domain of one heavy chain C1 . Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding i.e. it has a single antigen binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F ab fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen binding activity and is still capable of cross linking antigen. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors FcR found on certain types of cells.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable region domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv scFv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops 3 loops each from the H and L chain that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Single chain Fv also abbreviated as sFv or scFv are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 Borrebaeck 1995 infra.

The term diabodies refers to antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . The small antibody fragments are prepared by constructing sFv fragments see preceding paragraph with short linkers about 5 10 residues between the Vand Vdomains such that inter chain but not intra chain pairing of the V domains is achieved resulting in a bivalent fragment i.e. fragment having two antigen binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two crossover sFv fragments in which the Vand Vdomains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial eukaryotic animal or plant cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 for example.

The monoclonal antibodies herein include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey Ape etc and human constant region sequences.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non human antibody. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or non human primate having the desired antibody specificity affinity and capability. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . See also the following review articles and references cited therein Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 115 1998 Harris 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 433 1994 .

 Thio when used herein to refer to an antibody refers to a cysteine engineered antibody while hu when used herein to refer to an antibody refers to a humanized antibody.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the V11 H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The end of the Chothia CDR H1 loop when numbered using the Kabat numbering convention varies between 1132 and 1134 depending on the length of the loop this is because the Kabat numbering scheme places the insertions at H35A and HB if neither 35A nor 35B is present the loop ends at 32 if only 35A is present the loop ends at 33 if both 35A and 35B are present the loop ends at 34 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

Hypervariable regions may comprise extended hypervariable regions as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the VL and 26 35B H1 50 65 47 65 or 49 65 112 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues herein defined.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. supra . The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 640 323 Figures for EU numbering .

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.

A species dependent antibody e.g. a mammalian anti human IgE antibody is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally the species dependent antibody bind specifically to a human antigen i.e. has a binding affinity Kd value of no more than about 1 10M preferably no more than about 1 10and most preferably no more than about 1 10M but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non human mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold or at least about 500 fold or at least about 1000 fold weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

 Or better when used herein to refer to binding affinity refers to a stronger binding between a molecule and its binding partner. Or better when used herein refers to a stronger binding represented by a smaller numerical Kd value. For example an antibody which has an affinity for an antigen of 0.6 nM or better the antibody s affinity for the antigen is 

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.

According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. as described above.

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide.

An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof or may contain pre existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less or 3 or less pre existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes are only at three two or one of positions 71H 73H and 78H for instance the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A 73T and or 78A. In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.

A VH subgroup III consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al. In one embodiment the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS SEQ ID NO 14 H1 WVRQAPGKGLEWV SEQ ID NO 15 H2 RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC SEQ ID NO 16 H3 WGQGTLVTVSS SEQ ID NO 17 .

A VL subgroup I consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al. In one embodiment the VL subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences 

An unmodified human framework is a human framework which has the same amino acid sequence as the acceptor human framework e.g. lacking human to non human amino acid substitution s in the acceptor human framework.

An altered hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region comprising one or more e.g. one to about 16 amino acid substitution s therein.

An un modified hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region having the same amino acid sequence as a non human antibody from which it was derived i.e. one which lacks one or more amino acid substitutions therein.

An antibody which binds an antigen of interest e.g. a tumor associated polypeptide antigen target is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen and does not significantly cross react with other proteins. In such embodiments the extent of binding of the antibody to a non target protein will be less than about 10 of the binding of the antibody to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation RIA . With regard to the binding of an antibody to a target molecule the term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured for example by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target for example an excess of non labeled target. In this case specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited for example by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M or greater. In one embodiment the term specific binding refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.

An antibody that inhibits the growth of tumor cells expressing a FcRH5 polypeptide or a growth inhibitory antibody is one which results in measurable growth inhibition of cancer cells expressing or overexpressing the appropriate FcRH5 polypeptide. The FcRH5 polypeptide may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of a cancer cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by a cancer cell. Preferred growth inhibitory anti FcRH5 antibodies inhibit growth of FcRH5 expressing tumor cells by greater than 20 preferably from about 20 to about 50 and even more preferably by greater than 50 e.g. from about 50 to about 100 as compared to the appropriate control the control typically being tumor cells not treated with the antibody being tested. In one embodiment growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.1 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways such as is described in the Experimental Examples section below. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti FcRH5 antibody at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

An antibody which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is usually one which overexpresses a FcRH5 polypeptide. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell e.g. a hematopoietic cell such as a B cell T cell basophil eosinophil neutrophil monocyte platelet or erythrocyte. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold preferably about 5 to 50 fold and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay.

An antibody which induces cell death is one which causes a viable cell to become nonviable. The cell is one which expresses a FcRH5 polypeptide and is of a cell type which specifically expresses or overexpresses a FcRH5 polypeptide. The cell may be cancerous or normal cells of the particular cell type. The FcRH5 polypeptide may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of a cancer cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by a cancer cell. The cell may be a cancer cell e.g. a B cell or T cell. Cell death in vitro may be determined in the absence of complement and immune effector cells to distinguish cell death induced by antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . Thus the assay for cell death may be performed using heat inactivated serum i.e. in the absence of complement and in the absence of immune effector cells. To determine whether the antibody is able to induce cell death loss of membrane integrity as evaluated by uptake of propidium iodide PI trypan blue see Moore et al. 17 1 11 1995 or 7AAD can be assessed relative to untreated cells. Preferred cell death inducing antibodies are those which induce PI uptake in the PI uptake assay in BT474 cells.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

The term Fc region herein is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during production or purification of the antibody or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed antibody populations with no K447 residues removed and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include C lq binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed for example in definitions herein.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification preferably one or more amino acid substitution s . Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 homology therewith more preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fe RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see review M. in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 492 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 .

Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2000 42072 Presta describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also e.g. Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences polypeptides with a variant Fc region and increased or decreased C lq binding capability are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 B1 and WO 1999 51642. See also e.g. Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising antibody refers to an antibody that comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the antibody or by recombinant engineering of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody. Accordingly a composition comprising an antibody having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise an antibody with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

The FcRH5 polypeptide extracellular domain or ECD refers to a form of the FcRH5 polypeptide which is essentially free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily a FcRH5 polypeptide ECD will have less than 1 of such transmembrane and or cytoplasmic domains and preferably will have less than 0.5 of such domains. It will be understood that any transmembrane domains identified for the FcRH5 polypeptides of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain as initially identified herein. Optionally therefore an extracellular domain of a FcRH5 polypeptide may contain from about 5 or fewer amino acids on either side of the transmembrane domain extracellular domain boundary as identified in the Examples or specification and such polypeptides with or without the associated signal peptide and nucleic acid encoding them are contemplated by the present invention.

The approximate location of the signal peptides of the FcRH5 polypeptide disclosed herein may be shown in the present specification and or the accompanying figures. It is noted however that the C terminal boundary of a signal peptide may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the signal peptide C terminal boundary as initially identified herein wherein the C terminal boundary of the signal peptide may be identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of amino acid sequence element e.g. Nielsen et al. 10 1 6 1997 and von Heinje et al. 14 4683 4690 1986 . Moreover it is also recognized that in some cases cleavage of a signal sequence from a secreted polypeptide is not entirely uniform resulting in more than one secreted species. These mature polypeptides where the signal peptide is cleaved within no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the C terminal boundary of the signal peptide as identified herein and the polynucleotides encoding them are contemplated by the present invention.

Optionally FcRH5 variant polypeptides will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native FcRH5 polypeptide sequence alternatively no more than 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native FcRH5 polypeptide sequence.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence i.e. FcRH5 polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence i.e. FcRH5 polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.

In other embodiments FcRH5 variant polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules that encode a FcRH5 polypeptide and which are capable of hybridizing preferably under stringent hybridization and wash conditions to nucleotide sequences encoding a full length FcRH5 polypeptide as disclosed herein. FcRH5 variant polypeptides may be those that are encoded by a FcRH5 variant polynucleotide.

The term full length coding region when used in reference to a nucleic acid encoding a FcRH5 polypeptide refers to the sequence of nucleotides which encode the full length FcRH5 polypeptide of the invention which is often shown between start and stop codons inclusive thereof in the accompanying figures . The term full length coding region when used in reference to an ATCC deposited nucleic acid refers to the FcRH5 polypeptide encoding portion of the cDNA that is inserted into the vector deposited with the ATCC which is often shown between start and stop codons inclusive thereof in the accompanying figures start and stop codons are bolded and underlined in the figures .

 Isolated when used to describe the various FcRH5 polypeptides disclosed herein means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with therapeutic uses for the polypeptide and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be purified 1 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 2 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under non reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the FcRH5 polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated FcRH5 polypeptide encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term control sequences refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes for example include a promoter optionally an operator sequence and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters polyadenylation signals and enhancers.

Nucleic acid is operably linked when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading phase. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.

 Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions see Ausubel et al. Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995 .

 Stringent conditions or high stringency conditions as defined herein may be identified by those that 1 employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing for example 0.015 M sodium chloride 0.0015 M sodium citrate 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50EC 2 employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide for example 50 v v formamide with 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Ficoll 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride 75 mM sodium citrate at 42EC or 3 overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.75 M NaCl 0.075 M sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 5 Denhardt s solution sonicated salmon sperm DNA 50 g ml 0.1 SDS and 10 dextran sulfate at 42EC with a 10 minute wash at 42EC in 0.2 SSC sodium chloride sodium citrate followed by a 10 minute high stringency wash consisting of 0.1 SSC containing EDTA at 55EC.

 Moderately stringent conditions may be identified as described by Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions e.g. temperature ionic strength and SDS less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37EC in a solution comprising 20 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 mg ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 1 SSC at about 37 50EC. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature ionic strength etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.

The term epitope tagged when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FcRH5 polypeptide or anti FcRH5 antibody fused to a tag polypeptide . The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 and 50 amino acid residues preferably between about 10 and 20 amino acid residues .

 Active or activity for the purposes herein refers to form s of a FcRH5 polypeptide which retain a biological and or an immunological activity of native or naturally occurring FcRH5 wherein biological activity refers to a biological function either inhibitory or stimulatory caused by a native or naturally occurring FcRH5 other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring FcRH5 and an immunological activity refers to the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring FcRH5.

The term antagonist is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks inhibits or neutralizes a biological activity of a native FcRH5 polypeptide. In a similar manner the term agonist is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that mimics a biological activity of a native FcRH5 polypeptide. Suitable agonist or antagonist molecules specifically include agonist or antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments fragments or amino acid sequence variants of native FcRH5 polypeptides peptides antisense oligonucleotides small organic molecules etc. Methods for identifying agonists or antagonists of a FcRH5 polypeptide may comprise contacting a FcRH5 polypeptide with a candidate agonist or antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with the FcRH5 polypeptide.

 Purified means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 95 by weight or at least 98 by weight of the sample in which it is contained.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is separated from at least one other nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated for example in its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid molecule further includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid molecule but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromasomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs .alpha. anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR.sub.2 amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH.sub.2 formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C. optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

 Oligonucleotide as used herein generally refers to short generally single stranded generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally but not necessarily less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.

Plasma cells disorders result from the uncontrolled division or multiplication of a plasma cell clone. Plasma cells arise from activated B lymphocytes i.e. B cells . Each B cell produces a unique receptor known as the B cell receptor arrayed on its cell surface that is specific for a foreign substance i.e. antigen. When a B cell receptor binds its cognate antigen the cell expressing the receptor is activated to re enter the cell cycle producing many clonal copies of itself. The clones mature into plasma cells that reside principally in the bone marrow and that are specialized to produce copies of the B cell receptor that are released into the blood stream as antibodies. In a plasma cell disorder the plasma cell or the parent B cell suffers genetic damage resulting in suppression of or insensitivity to the normal restraints on cell division and or activity. Daughter plasma cells derived from such cells are malignant in that they may divide unchecked and or generate excess amount of the same immunoglobulin antibody . Often the immunoglobulin produced is incomplete or has an incorrect conformation that can result in accumulation of the protein also known as monoclonal protein M protein paraprotein or amyloid protein dependent on the specific disorder in the serum tissues or organs especially the kidneys leading to organ dysfunction and or failure. Plasma cell disorders include monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance MGUS multiple myeloma MM macroglobulinemia heavy chain diseases and systemic light chain amyloidosis AL which are differentiated based on the proliferative nature of the clone the extent of marrow involvement and the type of M protein expressed. Additional plasma cell disorders are solitary plasmacytoma extramedullary plasmacytoma multiple solitary plasmacytomas plasma cell leukaemia Waldenstrom s macroglobulinaemia B cell non Hodgkin lymphomas B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although new immunotherapies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab have improved disease free and overall survival in some B cell malignancies such therapies have not proven effective in the treatment of plasma cell disorders in part because the target antigens CD20 and CD52 respectively are not sufficiently expressed by the malignant clonal plasma cells. Thus there is a need for identification and development of improved therapy of plasma cell disorders. see U.S. Published Application Nos. 20080166742 and 20080317745 each of which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety .

The expression of FcRH5 IRTA2 on B cells plasma cells and multiple myeloma cells including cells from MM patient samples has previously been shown. see U.S. Published Application No. 20060251662 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Accordingly in light of the FcRH5 expression pattern in multiple myeloma samples the molecule is an excellent target for therapy of tumors in mammals including plasma cell disorders such as those described herein i.e. multiple myeloma and diseases associated with antibody secretion such as allergy or autoimmune diseases.

A disorder is any condition that would benefit from treatment with a substance molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancerous conditions such as malignant and benign tumors non leukemias and lymphoid malignancies neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic and other glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal and blastocoelic disorders and inflammatory immunologic and other angiogenesis related disorders.

An autoimmune disease herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual s own tissues or organs or a co segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom. In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders a number of clinical and laboratory markers may exist including but not limited to hypergammaglobulinemia high levels of autoantibodies antigen antibody complex deposits in tissues benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments and lymphoid cell aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B cell mediated autoimmune disease it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases through a multitude of mechanistic pathways including autoantibody production immune complex formation dendritic and T cell activation cytokine synthesis direct chemokine release and providing a nidus for ectopic neo lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of autoimmune diseases.

 Autoimmune disease can be an organ specific disease i.e. the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system the hematopoietic system the skin the cardiopulmonary system the gastrointestinal and liver systems the renal system the thyroid the ears the neuromuscular system the central nervous system etc. or a systemic disease which can affect multiple organ systems for example systemic lupus erythematosus SLE rheumatoid arthritis polymyositis etc. . Preferred such diseases include autoimmune rheumatologic disorders such as for example rheumatoid arthritis Sj gren s syndrome scleroderma lupus such as SLE and lupus nephritis polymyositis dermatomyositis cryoglobulinemia anti phospholipid antibody syndrome and psoriatic arthritis autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders such as for example inflammatory bowel diseases e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia autoimmune hepatitis primary biliary cirrhosis primary sclerosing cholangitis and celiac disease vasculitis such as for example ANCA negative vasculitis and ANCA associated vasculitis including Churg Strauss vasculitis Wegener s granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis autoimmune neurological disorders such as for example multiple sclerosis opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome myasthenia gravis neuromyelitis optica Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease and autoimmune polyneuropathies renal disorders such as for example glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s syndrome and Berger s disease autoimmune dermatologic disorders such as for example psoriasis urticaria hives pemphigus vulgaris bullous pemphigoid and cutaneous lupus erythematosus hematologic disorders such as for example thrombocytopenic purpura thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura post transfusion purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia atherosclerosis uveitis autoimmune hearing diseases such as for example inner ear disease and hearing loss Behcet s disease Raynaud s syndrome organ transplant and autoimmune endocrine disorders such as for example diabetic related autoimmune diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM Addison s disease and autoimmune thyroid disease e.g. Graves disease and thyroiditis .

Such diseases are contemplated herein to be treated by the administration of an antibody which binds to a B cell surface marker such as FcRH5 and includes the administration of an unconjugated naked antibody or an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent as disclosed herein. Such diseases are also contemplated herein to be treated by combination therapy including an anti FcRH5 antibody or anti FcRH5 antibody drug conjugate of the invention in combination with another antibody or antibody drug conjugate another cytoxic agent radiation or other treatment administered simultaneously or in series.

 Treating or treatment or alleviation refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. A subject or mammal is successfully treated for a FcRH5 polypeptide expressing cancer if after receiving a therapeutic amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody according to the methods of the present invention the patient shows observable and or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following reduction in the number of cancer cells or absence of the cancer cells reduction in the tumor size inhibition i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone inhibition i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop of tumor metastasis inhibition to some extent of tumor growth and or relief to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer reduced morbidity and mortality and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent the anti FcRH5 antibody may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.

The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy efficacy can be measured for example by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR . Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and by bone scan and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine spread to the bone. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to the pelvis and lymph nodes in the area. Chest X rays and measurement of liver enzyme levels by known methods are used to look for metastasis to the lungs and liver respectively. Other routine methods for monitoring the disease include transrectal ultrasonography TRUS and transrectal needle biopsy TRNB .

For bladder cancer which is a more localized cancer methods to determine progress of disease include urinary cytologic evaluation by cystoscopy monitoring for presence of blood in the urine visualization of the urothelial tract by sonography or an intravenous pyelogram computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI . The presence of distant metastases can be assessed by CT of the abdomen chest x rays or radionuclide imaging of the skeleton.

 Chronic administration refers to administration of the agent s in a continuous mode as opposed to an acute mode so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect activity for an extended period of time. Intermittent administration is treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption but rather is cyclic in nature.

A small molecule or small organic molecule is defined herein to have a molecular weight below about 500 Daltons.

An individual subject or patient is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments the vertebrate is a mammal. mammals include but are not limited to farm animals such as cows sport animals pets such as cats dogs and horses primates mice and rats. In certain embodiments a mammal is human.

The term pharmaceutical formulation refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered. Such formulation may be sterile.

An effective amount of an antibody as disclosed herein is an amount sufficient to carry out a specifically stated purpose. An effective amount may be determined empirically and in a routine manner in relation to the stated purpose.

The term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of an antibody or other drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a subject or mammal. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. See the definition herein of treating . To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

A growth inhibitory amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody is an amount capable of inhibiting the growth of a cell especially tumor e.g. cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. A growth inhibitory amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody for purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth may be determined empirically and in a routine manner.

A cytotoxic amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody is an amount capable of causing the destruction of a cell especially tumor e.g. cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. A cytotoxic amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody for purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth may be determined empirically and in a routine manner.

A FcRH5 expressing cell is a cell which expresses an endogenous or transfected FcRH5 polypeptide either on the cell surface or in a secreted form. A FcRH5 expressing cancer is a cancer comprising cells that have a FcRH5 polypeptide present on the cell surface or that produce and secrete a FcRH5 polypeptide. A FcRH5 expressing cancer optionally produces sufficient levels of FcRH5 polypeptide on the surface of cells thereof such that an anti FcRH5 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer. In another embodiment a FcRH5 expressing cancer optionally produces and secretes sufficient levels of FcRH5 polypeptide such that an anti FcRH5 antibody antagonist can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer. With regard to the latter the antagonist may be an antisense oligonucleotide which reduces inhibits or prevents production and secretion of the secreted FcRH5 polypeptide by tumor cells. A cancer which overexpresses a FcRH5 polypeptide is one which has significantly higher levels of FcRH5 polypeptide at the cell surface thereof or produces and secretes compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. FcRH5 polypeptide overexpression may be determined in a detection or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the FcRH5 protein present on the surface of a cell or secreted by the cell e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay using anti FcRH5 antibodies prepared against an isolated FcRH5 polypeptide which may be prepared using recombinant DNA technology from an isolated nucleic acid encoding the FcRH5 polypeptide FACS analysis etc. . Alternatively or additionally one may measure levels of FcRH5 polypeptide encoding nucleic acid or mRNA in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization using a nucleic acid based probe corresponding to a FcRH5 encoding nucleic acid or the complement thereof FISH see WO98 45479 published October 1998 Southern blotting Northern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as real time quantitative PCR RT PCR . One may also study FcRH5 polypeptide overexpression by measuring shed antigen in a biological fluid such as serum e.g. using antibody based assays see also e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 issued Jun. 12 1990 WO91 05264 published Apr. 18 1991 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 issued Mar. 28 1995 and Sias et al. 132 73 80 1990 . Aside from the above assays various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.

As used herein the term immunoadhesin designates antibody like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein an adhesin with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains.

As is well established in the art binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly in one embodiment the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity e.g. with minimized avidity effects . Generally and preferably binding affinity is measured in vitro whether in a cell free or cell associated setting. As described in greater detail herein fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the monovalent binding affinity value of a humanized antibody e.g. in Fab form and the monovalent binding affinity value of a reference comparator antibody e.g. in Fab form e.g. a murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions.

For example in one embodiment if an antibody of the invention A has an affinity that is 3 fold lower than the affinity of a reference antibody M then if the Kd value for A is 3 the Kd value of M would be 1 and the ratio of Kd of A to Kd of M would be 3 1.

The cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies humanized or chimeric monoclonal antibodies and antigen binding fragments of antibodies fusion polypeptides and analogs that preferentially bind cell associated FcRH5 polypeptides. A cysteine engineered antibody may alternatively comprise an antibody comprising a cysteine at a position disclosed herein in the antibody or Fab resulting from the sequence design and or selection of the antibody without necessarily altering a parent antibody such as by phage display antibody design and selection or through de novo design of light chain and or heavy chain framework sequences and constant regions. A cysteine engineered antibody comprises one or more free cysteine amino acids having a thiol reactivity value in the ranges of 0.6 to 1.0 0.7 to 1.0 or 0.8 to 1.0. A free cysteine amino acid is a cysteine residue which has been engineered into the parent antibody and is not part of a disulfide bridge. Cysteine engineered antibodies are useful for attachment of cytotoxic and or imaging compounds at the site of the engineered cysteine through for example a maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein such as amino group of lysine residues or the N terminal amino group.

Various enzyme substrate labels are available or disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 4 275 149 . The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate which can be measured spectrophotometrically.

For example the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin or streptavidin or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to streptavidin and thus the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant the polypeptide variant is conjugated with a small hapten e.g. digoxin and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti hapten polypeptide variant e.g. anti digoxin antibody . Thus indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant can be achieved Hermanson G. 1996 in Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press San Diego .

The antibody of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method such as ELISA competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays Zola 1987 Monoclonal Antibodies A Manual of Techniques pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. .

A detection label may be useful for localizing visualizing and quantitating a binding or recognition event. The labelled antibodies of the invention can detect cell surface receptors. Another use for detectably labelled antibodies is a method of bead based immunocapture comprising conjugating a bead with a fluorescent labelled antibody and detecting a fluorescence signal upon binding of a ligand. Similar binding detection methodologies utilize the surface plasmon resonance SPR effect to measure and detect antibody antigen interactions.

Detection labels such as fluorescent dyes and chemiluminescent dyes Briggs et al 1997 Synthesis of Functionalised Fluorescent Dyes and Their Coupling to Amines and Amino Acids J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 1051 1058 provide a detectable signal and are generally applicable for labelling antibodies preferably with the following properties i the labelled antibody should produce a very high signal with low background so that small quantities of antibodies can be sensitively detected in both cell free and cell based assays and ii the labelled antibody should be photostable so that the fluorescent signal may be observed monitored and recorded without significant photo bleaching. For applications involving cell surface binding of labelled antibody to membranes or cell surfaces especially live cells the labels preferably iii have good water solubility to achieve effective conjugate concentration and detection sensitivity and iv are non toxic to living cells so as not to disrupt the normal metabolic processes of the cells or cause premature cell death.

Labelled antibodies of the invention are useful as imaging biomarkers and probes by the various methods and techniques of biomedical and molecular imaging such as i MRI magnetic resonance imaging ii MicroCT computerized tomography iii SPECT single photon emission computed tomography iv PET positron emission tomography Chen et al 2004 Bioconjugate Chem. 15 41 49 v bioluminescence vi fluorescence and vii ultrasound Immunoscintigraphy is an imaging procedure in which antibodies labeled with radioactive substances are administered to an animal or human patient and a picture is taken of sites in the body where the antibody localizes U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 624 . Imaging biomarkers may be objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types Type 0 are natural history markers of a disease and correlate longitudinally with known clinical indices e.g. MRI assessment of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis Type I markers capture the effect of an intervention in accordance with a mechanism of action even though the mechanism may not be associated with clinical outcome Type II markers function as surrogate endpoints where the change in or signal from the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit to validate the targeted response such as measured bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis by CT. Imaging biomarkers thus can provide pharmacodynamic PD therapeutic information about i expression of a target protein ii binding of a therapeutic to the target protein i.e. selectivity and iii clearance and half life pharmacokinetic data. Advantages of in vivo imaging biomarkers relative to lab based biomarkers include non invasive treatment quantifiable whole body assessment repetitive dosing and assessment i.e. multiple time points and potentially transferable effects from preclinical small animal to clinical human results. For some applications bioimaging supplants or minimizes the number of animal experiments in preclinical studies.

Fluorescent dyes include molecules with extended aromaticity such as fluorescein and rhodamine and their derivatives. The fluorescent reporter may be partially or significantly quenched by the quencher moiety in an intact peptide. Upon cleavage of the peptide by a peptidase or protease a detectable increase in fluorescence may be measured Knight C. 1995 Fluorimetric Assays of Proteolytic Enzymes Methods in Enzymology Academic Press 248 18 34 .

The labelled antibodies of the invention may also be used as an affinity purification agent. In this process the labelled antibody is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified which is bound to the immobilized polypeptide variant. Finally the support is washed with another suitable solvent such as glycine buffer pH 5.0 that will release the antigen from the polypeptide variant.

Labelling reagents typically bear reactive functionality which may react i directly with a cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody to form the labelled antibody ii with a linker reagent to form a linker label intermediate or iii with a linker antibody to form the labelled antibody. Reactive functionality of labelling reagents include maleimide haloacetyl iodoacetamide succinimidyl ester e.g. NHS N hydroxysuccinimide isothiocyanate sulfonyl chloride 2 6 dichlorotriazinyl pentafluorophenyl ester and phosphoramidite although other functional groups can also be used.

An exemplary reactive functional group is N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester NHS of a carboxyl group substituent of a detectable label e.g. biotin or a fluorescent dye. The NHS ester of the label may be preformed isolated purified and or characterized or it may be formed in situ and reacted with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Typically the carboxyl form of the label is activated by reacting with some combination of a carbodiimide reagent e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide diisopropylcarbodiimide or a uronium reagent e.g. TSTU O N Succinimidyl N N N N tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate HBTU O benzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or HATU O 7 azabenzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate an activator such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt and N hydroxysuccinimide to give the NHS ester of the label. In some cases the label and the antibody may be coupled by in situ activation of the label and reaction with the antibody to form the label antibody conjugate in one step. Other activating and coupling reagents include TBTU 2 1H benzotriazo 1 yl 1 1 3 3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate TFFH N N N N tetramethyluronium 2 fluoro hexafluorophosphate PyBOP benzotriazole 1 yl oxy tris pyrrolidino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate EEDQ 2 ethoxy 1 ethoxycarbonyl 1 2 dihydro quinoline DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DIPCDI diisopropylcarbodiimide MSNT 1 mesitylene 2 sulfonyl 3 nitro 1H 1 2 4 triazole and aryl sulfonyl halides e.g. triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.

In one aspect the antibody of the invention is fused to an albumin binding protein. Plasma protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. Serum albumin binding peptides ABP can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins including alteration of tissue uptake penetration and diffusion. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence US 20040001827 . A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening Dennis et al. 2002 Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins J Biol. Chem. 277 35035 35043 WO 01 45746 . Compounds of the invention include ABP sequences taught by i Dennis et al 2002 J Biol. Chem. 277 35035 35043 at Tables III and IV page 35038 ii US 20040001827 at 0076 SEQ ID NOS 9 22 and iii WO 01 45746 at pages 12 13 all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Albumin Binding ABP Fabs are engineered by fusing an albumin binding peptide to the C terminus of Fab heavy chain in 1 1 stoichiometric ratio 1 ABP 1 Fab . It was shown that association of these ABP Fabs with albumin increased antibody half life by more than 25 fold in rabbits and mice. The above described reactive Cys residues can therefore be introduced in these ABP Fabs and used for site specific conjugation with cytotoxic drugs followed by in vivo animal studies.

An aspect of the invention is an assay for detecting cancer cells comprising a exposing cells to a cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibody drug conjugate and b determining the extent of binding of the cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibody drug conjugate compound to the cells.

In one embodiment the present invention provides anti FcRH5 antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic agents. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies.

 Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen especially when synthetic peptides are used to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent e.g. maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or R N C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g. by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G Sepharose or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pliickthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain Cand CO sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response human anti mouse antibody when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. Reduction or elimination of a HAMA response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See e.g. Khaxzaeli et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988 80 937 Jaffers et al. Transplantation 1986 41 572 Shawler et al. J. Immunol. 1985 135 1530 Sears et al. J. Biol. Response Mod. 1984 3 138 Miller et al. Blood 1983 62 988 Hakimi et al. J. Immunol. 1991 147 1352 Reichmann et al. Nature 1988 332 323 Junghans et al. Cancer Res. 1990 50 1495. As described herein the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art some of which are further described below. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region FR within it accepted for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

For example an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting parent sequence for diversification of the framework and or hypervariable sequence s . A selected framework sequence to which a starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from or derived from a human immunoglobulin the VL and or VH regions thereof preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from or derived from a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal or no immunogenicity in human patients.

Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin one may optionally select a human framework sequence that is selected based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and select the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.

In one embodiment human consensus frameworks herein are from or derived from VH subgroup III and or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.

While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected whether that be from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre existing substitutions are preferably minimal usually four three two or one amino acid differences only relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.

Hypervariable region residues of the non human antibody are incorporated into the VL and or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues the Chothia hypervariable loop residues the Abm residues and or contact residues. Optionally the extended hypervariable region residues as follows are incorporated 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 26 35B H1 50 65 47 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 .

While incorporation of hypervariable region residues is discussed herein it will be appreciated that this can be achieved in various ways for example nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the hypervariable domain residues are changed to non human residues or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence etc.

In the examples herein hypervariable region grafted variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 . Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and or hypervariable region using routine techniques to correct and re establish proper hypervariable region antigen interactions.

Phage mid display also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts can be used as a convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library generated by sequence randomization. However other methods for making and screening altered antibodies are available to the skilled person.

Phage mid display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins which bind to a ligand such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage mid display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. Bass S. 8 309 1990 Lowman and Wells 3 205 1991 . In a monovalent phagemid display system the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 286 U.S. Pat. No. 5 432 018 U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 717 U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 498 530 .

Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage mid display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 373 5 733 743 5 837 242 5 969 108 6 172 197 5 580 717 and 5 658 727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.

Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well established in the art some of which are described herein. For example hypervariable region residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See e.g. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 .

The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the hypervariable region residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according to the IUB code.

For example in the codon set DVK D can be nucleotides A or G or T V can be A or G or C and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala Trp Tyr Lys Thr Asn Lys Ser Arg Asp Glu Gly and Cys.

Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized for example by solid phase synthesis containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide degeneracy at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers available from for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. or can be obtained commercially for example from Life Technologies Rockville Md. . Therefore a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides as used according to the invention have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.

In one method nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10 6487 6504 1987 . Briefly nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template where the template is the single stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.

Generally oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide s coding for the mutation s . This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al. 75 5765 1978 .

The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors the commercially available M13 mp 18 and M13 mp 19 vectors are suitable or those vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. above.

To alter the native DNA sequence the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme usually T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1 and the other strand the original template encodes the native unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a 32 Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.

The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation s . The modifications are as follows The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine dATP deoxyriboguanosine dGTP and deoxyribothymidine dTT is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP aS which can be obtained from Amersham . This mixture is added to the template oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP aS instead of dCTP which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site s to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single stranded. A complete double stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ATP and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.

As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also but does not necessarily contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

According to another method antigen binding may be restored during humanization of antibodies through the selection of repaired hypervariable regions See application Ser. No. 11 061 841 filed Feb. 18 2005 . The method includes incorporating non human hypervariable regions onto an acceptor framework and further introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in one or more hypervariable regions without modifying the acceptor framework sequence. Alternatively the introduction of one or more amino acid substitutions may be accompanied by modifications in the acceptor framework sequence.

According to another method a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a library of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as nucleic acid cassettes as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences for example viral coat proteins and dimerization domains using established molecular biology techniques.

The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.

Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria as selected through appropriate screening selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Various forms of a humanized anti FcRH5 antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. Nature 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm 5 545 807 and WO 97 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g. Johnson Kevin S and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of a FcRH5 protein as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a FcRH5 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively an anti FcRH5 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the FcRH5 expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express FcRH5. These antibodies possess a FcRH5 binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fca antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 821 337 and 6 407 213 teach bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibodies. Additional bispecific antibodies that bind an epitope on the CD3 antigen and a second epitope have been described. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 078 998 anti CD3 tumor cell antigen U.S. Pat. No. 5 601 819 anti CD3 IL 2R anti CD3 CD28 anti CD3 CD45 U.S. Pat. No. 6 129 914 anti CD3 malignant B cell antigen U.S. Pat. No. 7 112 324 anti CD3 CD19 U.S. Pat. No. 6 723 538 anti CD3 CCR5 U.S. Pat. No. 7 235 641 anti CD3 EpCAM U.S. Pat. No. 7 262 276 anti CD3 ovarian tumor antigen and U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 anti CD3 CD4IgG .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers. Bispecific antibodies produced in accordance with this approach are referred to herein as protuberance into cavity antibodies.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH VH CH Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. J. Immunol. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin auristatin peptides such as monomethylauristatin MMAE synthetic analog of dolastatin maytansinoids such as DM1 a trichothene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

An immunoconjugate or antibody drug conjugate ADC of the invention may be of Formula I below wherein an antibody is conjugated i.e. covalently attached to one or more drug moieties D through an optional linker L . ADCs may include thioMAb drug conjugates TDC . Ab L D I

Accordingly the antibody may be conjugated to the drug either directly or via a linker. In Formula I p is the average number of drug moieties per antibody which can range e.g. from about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody and in certain embodiments from 1 to about 8 drug moieties per antibody. The invention includes a composition comprising a mixture of antibody drug compounds of Formula I where the average drug loading per antibody is about 2 to about 5 or about 3 to about 4.

A linker may comprise one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit or vc alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl a PAB and those resulting from conjugation with linker reagents N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate forming linker moiety 4 mercaptopentanoic acid SPP N succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate forming linker moiety 4 2 5 dioxopyrrolidin 1 yl methylicyclohexanecarboxylic acid SMCC also referred to herein as MCC 2 5 dioxopyrrolidin 1 yl 4 pyridin 2 yldisulfanyl butanoate forming linker moiety 4 mercaptobutanoic acid SPDB N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB ethyleneoxy CHCHO as one or more repeating units EO or PEO . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. Various linker components are known in the art some of which are described below.

A linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of a drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker e.g. hydrazone protease sensitive e.g. peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

In certain embodiments a linker is as shown in the following Formula II A W Y II wherein A is a stretcher unit and a is an integer from 0 to 1 W is an amino acid unit and w is an integer from 0 to 12 Y is a spacer unit and y is 0 1 or 2 and Ab D and p are defined as above for Formula I. Exemplary embodiments of such linkers are described in US 2005 0238649 A1 which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise a stretcher unit that links an antibody to another linker component or to a drug moiety. Exemplary stretcher units are shown below wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to an antibody 

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise an amino acid unit. In one such embodiment the amino acid unit allows for cleavage of the linker by a protease thereby facilitating release of the drug from the immunoconjugate upon exposure to intracellular proteases such as lysosomal enzymes. See e.g. Doronina et al. 2003 21 778 784. Exemplary amino acid units include but are not limited to a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide and a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe phenylalanine lysine fk or phe lys or N methyl valine citrulline Me val cit . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . An amino acid unit may comprise amino acid residues that occur naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline Amino acid units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise a spacer unit that links the antibody to a drug moiety either directly or by way of a stretcher unit and or an amino acid unit. A spacer unit may be self immolative or a non self immolative. A non self immolative spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the drug moiety upon enzymatic e.g. proteolytic cleavage of the ADC. Examples of non self immolative spacer units include but are not limited to a glycine spacer unit and a glycine glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example enzymatic cleavage of an ADC containing a glycine glycine spacer unit by a tumor cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine glycine drug moiety from the remainder of the ADC. In one such embodiment the glycine glycine drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell thus cleaving the glycine glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.

A self immolative spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. In certain embodiments a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p aminobenzyl unit. In one such embodiment a p aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond and a carbamate methylcarbamate or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. See e.g. Hamann et al. 2005 2005 15 1087 1103. In one embodiment the spacer unit is p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB . In certain embodiments the phenylene portion of a p amino benzyl unit is substituted with Qm wherein Q is C Calkyl O C Calkyl halogen nitro or cyano and m is an integer ranging from 0 4. Examples of self immolative spacer units further include but are not limited to aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p aminobenzyl alcohol see e.g. US 2005 0256030 A1 such as 2 aminoimidazol 5 methanol derivatives Hay et al. 1999 9 2237 and ortho or para aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis such as substituted and unsubstituted 4 aminobutyric acid amides Rodrigues et al. 1995 2 223 appropriately substituted bicyclo 2.2.1 and bicyclo 2.2.2 ring systems Storm et al. 1972 94 5815 and 2 aminophenylpropionic acid amides Amsberry et al. 1990 55 5867 . Elimination of amine containing drugs that are substituted at the a position of glycine Kingsbury et al. 1984 27 1447 are also examples of self immolative spacers useful in ADCs.

In one embodiment a spacer unit is a branched bis hydroxymethyl styrene BHMS unit as depicted below which can be used to incorporate and release multiple drugs.

In another embodiment linker L may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody Sun et al 2002 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 2213 2215 Sun et al 2003 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 11 1761 1768 . Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker.

Exemplary linker components and combinations thereof are shown below in the context of ADCs of Formula II 

Linkers components including stretcher spacer and amino acid units may be synthesized by methods known in the art such as those described in US 2005 0238649 A1.

In some embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules. Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification or derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through disulfide and non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Maytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods or produced using genetic engineering and fermentation techniques U.S. Pat. No. 6 790 952 US 2005 0170475 Yu et al 2002 PNAS 99 7968 7973 . Maytansinol and maytansinol analogues may also be prepared synthetically according to known methods.

Exemplary maytansinoid drug moieties include those having a modified aromatic ring such as C 19 dechloro U.S. Pat. No. 4 256 746 prepared by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of ansamytocin P2 C 20 hydroxy or C 20 demethyl C 19 dechloro U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 361 650 and 4 307 016 prepared by demethylation using or or dechlorination using LAH and C 20 demethoxy C 20 acyloxy OCOR dechloro U.S. Pat. No. 4 294 757 prepared by acylation using acyl chlorides and those having modifications at other positions.

Exemplary maytansinoid drug moieties also include those having modifications such as C 9 SH U.S. Pat. No. 4 424 219 prepared by the reaction of maytansinol with HS or P C 14 alkoxymethyl demethoxy CHOR U.S. Pat. No. 4 331 598 C 14 hydroxymethyl or acyloxymethyl CHOH or CHOAc U.S. Pat. No. 4 450 254 prepared from C 15 hydroxy acyloxy U.S. Pat. No. 4 364 866 prepared by the conversion of maytansinol by C 15 methoxy U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 313 946 and 4 315 929 isolated from Trewia nudlflora C 18 N demethyl U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 362 663 and 4 322 348 prepared by the demethylation of maytansinol by and 4 5 deoxy U.S. Pat. No. 4 371 533 prepared by the titanium trichloride LAH reduction of maytansinol .

Many positions on maytansine compounds are known to be useful as the linkage position depending upon the type of link. For example for forming an ester linkage the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group are all suitable U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 U.S. Pat. No. RE39151 U.S. Pat. No. 6 913 748 U.S. Pat. No. 7 368 565 US 2006 0167245 US 2007 0037972 .

All stereoisomers of the maytansinoid drug moiety are contemplated for the compounds of the invention i.e. any combination of R and S configurations at the chiral carbons of D. In one embodiment the maytansinoid drug moiety will have the following stereochemistry 

Other exemplary maytansinoid antibody drug conjugates have the following structures and abbreviations wherein Ab is antibody and p is 1 to about 8 

In one embodiment the antibody drug conjugate is formed where DM4 is linked through an SPDB linker to a thiol group of the antibody see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 913 748 and 7 276 497 incorporated herein by reference in their entirety .

Exemplary antibody drug conjugates where DM1 is linked through a BMPEO linker to a thiol group of the antibody have the structure and abbreviation 

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making the same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in Erickson et al 2006 Cancer Res. 66 8 4426 4433 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 US 2005 0276812 A1 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . Maytansinoids can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove such as maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 and US 2005 016993 A1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in US 2005 0276812 A1 Antibody drug conjugates and Methods. The linkers comprise disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents. Additional linkers are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . In certain embodiments the coupling agent is N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 or N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In one embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to dolastatin or a dolastatin peptidic analog or derivative e.g. an auristatin U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF US 2005 0238649 disclosed in Senter et al Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research Volume 45 Abstract Number 623 presented Mar. 28 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Exemplary embodiments of ADCs of Formula I comprising an auristatin dolastatin or derivative thereof are described in US 2005 0238649 and Doronina et al. 2006 17 114 124 which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary embodiments of ADCs of Formula I comprising MMAE or MMAF and various linker components have the following structures and abbreviations wherein Ab is an antibody p is 1 to about 8 Val Cit or vc is a valine citrulline dipeptide and S is a sulfur atom. It will be noted that in certain of the structural descriptions of sulfur linked ADC herein the antibody is represented as Ab S merely to indicate the sulfur link feature and not to indicate that a particular sulfur atom bears multiple linker drug moieties. The left parentheses of the following structures may also be placed to the left of the sulfur atom between Ab and S which would be an equivalent description of the ADC of the invention described throughout herein.

Exemplary embodiments of ADCs of Formula I comprising MMAF and various linker components further include Ab MC PAB MMAF and Ab PAB MMAF. Interestingly immunoconjugates comprising MMAF attached to an antibody by a linker that is not proteolytically cleavable have been shown to possess activity comparable to immunoconjugates comprising MMAF attached to an antibody by a proteolytically cleavable linker. See Doronina et al. 2006 17 114 124. In such instances drug release is believed to be effected by antibody degradation in the cell. Id. Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. Liibke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of US 2005 0238649 A1 U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 588 Pettit et al 1989 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al 1998 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. 1996 719 725 Pettit et al 1996 1 5 859 863 and Doronina 2003 21 7 778 784.

In particular auristatin dolastatin drug moieties of formula D such as MMAF and derivatives thereof may be prepared using methods described in US 2005 0238649 A1 and Doronina et al. 2006 17 114 124. Auristatin dolastatin drug moieties of formula D such as MMAE and derivatives thereof may be prepared using methods described in Doronina et al. 2003 21 778 784. Drug linker moieties MC MMAF MC MMAE MC vc PAB MMAF and MC vc PAB MMAE may be conveniently synthesized by routine methods e.g. as described in Doronina et al. 2003 21 778 784 and Patent Application Publication No. US 2005 0238649 A1 and then conjugated to an antibody of interest.

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug to which the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to an antibody include BCNU streptozocin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively as the LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the immunoconjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the immunoconjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate may comprise an antibody conjugated to a prodrug activating enzyme that converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO 81 01145 to an active drug such as an anti cancer drug. Such immunoconjugates are useful in antibody dependent enzyme mediated prodrug therapy ADEPT . Enzymes that may be conjugated to an antibody include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatases which are useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatases which are useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase which is useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L which are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases which are useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase which are useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase which is useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase and penicillin G amidase which are useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Enzymes may be covalently bound to antibodies by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. See e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

Drug loading is represented by p the average number of drug moieties per antibody in a molecule of Formula I. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drug moieties D per antibody. ADCs of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Pharmaceutical formulations of Formula I antibody drug conjugates may thus be a heterogeneous mixture of such conjugates with antibodies linked to 1 2 3 4 or more drug moieties.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example where the attachment is a cysteine thiol as in the exemplary embodiments above an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates. In certain embodiments the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8 from about 2 to about 6 or from about 3 to about 5. Indeed it has been shown that for certain ADCs the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8 and may be about 2 to about 5. See US 2005 0238649 A1.

In certain embodiments fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate or linker reagent as discussed below. Generally antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or tricarbonylethylphosphine TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.

The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in different ways e.g. by i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography see e.g. McDonagh et al 2006 Prot. Engr. Design Selection 19 7 299 307 Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 Hamblett K. J. et al. Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology pharmacokinetics and toxicity of an anti CD30 antibody drug conjugate Abstract No. 624 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 Alley S. C. et al. Controlling the location of drug attachment in antibody drug conjugates Abstract No. 627 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 . In certain embodiments a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.

An ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Exemplary methods for preparing an ADC of Formula I via the latter route are described in US 2005 0238649 A1 which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol or tricarbonylethylphosphine TCEP such that the antibody is fully or partially reduced. Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues e.g. by reacting lysine residues with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. In one embodiment an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment antibodies containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Immunoconjugates comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may also be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. A recombinant DNA molecule may comprise regions encoding the antibody and cytotoxic portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment an antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such as streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

DNA encoding an amino acid sequence variant of the cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibodies and parent anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention is prepared by a variety of methods which include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants preparation by site directed or oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis Carter 1985 et al Nucleic Acids Res. 13 4431 4443 Ho et al 1989 Gene Amst. 77 51 59 Kunkel et al 1987 Proc.

Phage display technology McCafferty et al 1990 Nature 348 552 553 can be used to produce anti FcRH5 human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell Johnson et al 1993 Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3 564 571 Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol.

Anti FcRH5 antibodies may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. The appropriate amino acid sequence or portions thereof may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques Stewart et al. 1969 W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. Merrifield 1963 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 2149 2154 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated solid phase synthesis may be accomplished for instance employing t BOC or Fmoc protected amino acids and using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer Foster City Calif. using manufacturer s instructions. Various portions of the anti FcRH5 antibody or FcRH5 polypeptide may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired anti FcRH5 antibody or FcRH5 polypeptide.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies Morimoto et al 1992 Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 and Brennan et al 1985 Science 229 81 or produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv anti FcRH5 antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed herein. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al 1992 Bio Technology 10 163 167 or isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. The anti FcRH5 antibody may be a scFv single chain Fv fragment WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458 . The anti FcRH5 antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 . Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

The description below relates primarily to production of anti FcRH5 antibodies by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing anti FcRH5 antibody encoding nucleic acid. DNA encoding anti FcRH5 antibodies may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the anti FcRH5 antibody mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly human anti FcRH5 antibody or FcRH5 polypeptide DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The anti FcRH5 antibody encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures e.g. automated nucleic acid synthesis .

The design selection and preparation methods of the invention enable cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibodies which are reactive with electrophilic functionality. These methods further enable antibody conjugate compounds such as antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds with drug molecules at designated designed selective sites. Reactive cysteine residues on an antibody surface allow specifically conjugating a drug moiety through a thiol reactive group such as maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein such as amino group of lysine residues or the N terminal amino group. Thiol specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups but higher pH 9.0 and longer reaction times are required Garman 1997 Non Radioactive Labelling A Practical Approach Academic Press London . The amount of free thiol in a protein may be estimated by the standard Ellman s assay. Immunoglobulin M is an example of a disulfide linked pentamer while immunoglobulin G is an example of a protein with internal disulfide bridges bonding the subunits together. In proteins such as this reduction of the disulfide bonds with a reagent such as dithiothreitol DTT or selenol Singh et al 2002 Anal. Biochem. 304 147 156 is required to generate the reactive free thiol. This approach may result in loss of antibody tertiary structure and antigen binding specificity.

The PHESELECTOR Phage ELISA for Selection of Reactive Thiols Assay allows for detection of reactive cysteine groups in antibodies in an ELISA phage format thereby assisting in the design of cysteine engineered antibodies Junutula J. R. et al. 2008 J Immunol Methods 332 41 52 WO 2006 034488 US 2007 0092940 . The cysteine engineered antibody is coated on well surfaces followed by incubation with phage particles addition of HRP labeled secondary antibody and absorbance detection. Mutant proteins displayed on phage may be screened in a rapid robust and high throughput manner. Libraries of cysteine engineered antibodies can be produced and subjected to binding selection using the same approach to identify appropriately reactive sites of free Cys incorporation from random protein phage libraries of antibodies or other proteins. This technique includes reacting cysteine mutant proteins displayed on phage with an affinity reagent or reporter group which is also thiol reactive.

PHESELECTOR assay allows screening of reactive thiol groups in antibodies. Identification of the A121C variant by this method is exemplary. The entire Fab molecule may be effectively searched to identify more ThioFab variants with reactive thiol groups. A parameter fractional surface accessibility was employed to identify and quantitate the accessibility of solvent to the amino acid residues in a polypeptide. The surface accessibility can be expressed as the surface area that can be contacted by a solvent molecule e.g. water. The occupied space of water is approximated as a 1.4 radius sphere. Software is freely available or licensable Secretary to CCP4 Daresbury Laboratory Warrington WA4 4AD United Kingdom Fax 44 1925 603825 or by internet world wide web ccp4.ac.uk dist html INDEX.html as the CCP4 Suite of crystallography programs which employ algorithms to calculate the surface accessibility of each amino acid of a protein with known x ray crystallography derived coordinates The CCP4 Suite Programs for Protein Crystallography 1994 Acta. Cryst. D50 760 763 . Two exemplary software modules that perform surface accessibility calculations are AREAIMOL and SURFACE based on the algorithms of B. Lee and F. M. Richards 1971 J.Mol.Biol. 55 379 400. AREAIMOL defines the solvent accessible surface of a protein as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere representing a solvent molecule as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. AREAIMOL calculates the solvent accessible surface area by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms. AREAIMOL finds the solvent accessible area of atoms in a PDB coordinate file and summarizes the accessible area by residue by chain and for the whole molecule. Accessible areas or area differences for individual atoms can be written to a pseudo PDB output file. AREAIMOL assumes a single radius for each element and only recognizes a limited number of different elements.

AREAIMOL and SURFACE report absolute accessibilities i.e. the number of square Angstroms . Fractional surface accessibility is calculated by reference to a standard state relevant for an amino acid within a polypeptide. The reference state is tripeptide Gly X Gly where X is the amino acid of interest and the reference state should be an extended conformation i.e. like those in beta strands. The extended conformation maximizes the accessibility of X. A calculated accessible area is divided by the accessible area in a Gly X Gly tripeptide reference state and reports the quotient which is the fractional accessibility. Percent accessibility is fractional accessibility multiplied by 100. Another exemplary algorithm for calculating surface accessibility is based on the SOLV module of the program xsae Broger C. F. Hoffman LaRoche Basel which calculates fractional accessibility of an amino acid residue to a water sphere based on the X ray coordinates of the polypeptide. The fractional surface accessibility for every amino acid in an antibody may be calculated using available crystal structure information Eigenbrot et al. 1993 J Mol. Biol. 229 969 995 .

DNA encoding the cysteine engineered antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or other mammalian host cells such as myeloma cells U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 US 2005 0048572 US 2004 0229310 that do not otherwise produce the antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.

After design and selection cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. ThioFabs with the engineered highly reactive unpaired Cys residues free cysteine amino acids may be produced by i expression in a bacterial e.g. system Skerra et al 1993 Curr. Opinion in Immunol. 5 256 262 Pliickthun 1992 Immunol. Revs. 130 151 188 or a mammalian cell culture system WO 01 00245 e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO and ii purification using common protein purification techniques Lowman et al 1991 J. Biol. Chem. 266 17 10982 10988 .

The engineered Cys thiol groups react with electrophilic linker reagents and drug linker intermediates to form cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugates and other labelled cysteine engineered antibodies. Cys residues of cysteine engineered antibodies and present in the parent antibodies which are paired and form interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds do not have any reactive thiol groups unless treated with a reducing agent and do not react with electrophilic linker reagents or drug linker intermediates. The newly engineered Cys residue can remain unpaired and able to react with i.e. conjugate to an electrophilic linker reagent or drug linker intermediate such as a drug maleimide. Exemplary drug linker intermediates include MC MMAE MC MMAF MC vc PAB MMAE and MC vc PAB MMAF. The structure positions of the engineered Cys residues of the heavy and light chains are numbered according to a sequential numbering system. This sequential numbering system is correlated to the Kabat numbering system Kabat et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. starting at the N terminus differs from the Kabat numbering scheme bottom row by insertions noted by a b c. Using the Kabat numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. The cysteine engineered heavy chain variant sites are identified by the sequential numbering and Kabat numbering schemes.

Cysteine engineered anti FcRH5 antibodies may be site specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol reactive reagent. The thiol reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent a capture i.e. affinity label reagent e.g. a biotin linker reagent a detection label e.g. a fluorophore reagent a solid phase immobilization reagent e.g. SEPHAROSE polystyrene or glass or a drug linker intermediate. One example of a thiol reactive reagent is N ethyl maleimide NEM . In an exemplary embodiment reaction of a ThioFab with a biotin linker reagent provides a biotinylated ThioFab by which the presence and reactivity of the engineered cysteine residue may be detected and measured. Reaction of a ThioFab with a multifunctional linker reagent provides a ThioFab with a functionalized linker which may be further reacted with a drug moiety reagent or other label. Reaction of a ThioFab with a drug linker intermediate provides a ThioFab drug conjugate.

The exemplary methods described here may be applied generally to the identification and production of antibodies and more generally to other proteins through application of the design and screening steps described herein.

Such an approach may be applied to the conjugation of other thiol reactive reagents in which the reactive group is for example a maleimide an iodoacetamide a pyridyl disulfide or other thiol reactive conjugation partner Haugland 2003 Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals Molecular Probes Inc.

In another embodiment the linker may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody Sun et al 2002 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 2213 2215 Sun et al 2003 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 11 1761 1768 King 2002 Tetrahedron Letters 43 1987 1990 . Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker.

The linker may comprise amino acid residues. The Amino Acid unit W when present links the antibody Ab to the drug moiety D of the cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugate ADC of the invention.

The Spacer unit also links the drug moiety to the antibody unit when both the Amino Acid unit and Stretcher unit are absent w y 0 . Spacer units are of two general types self immolative and non self immolative.

In another embodiment linker L may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody Sun et al 2002 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 2213 2215 Sun et al 2003 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 11 1761 1768 . Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker. Exemplary embodiments of branched dendritic linkers include 2 6 bis hydroxymethyl p cresol and 2 4 6 tris hydroxymethyl phenol dendrimer units WO 2004 01993 Szalai et al 2003 J. Amer. Chem.

In another embodiment a Linker has a reactive functional group which has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

Typically peptide type Linkers can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method E. Schr der and K. L bke 1965 The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 Academic Press which is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Linker intermediates may be assembled with any combination or sequence of reactions including Spacer Stretcher and Amino Acid units. The Spacer Stretcher and Amino Acid units may employ reactive functional groups which are electrophilic nucleophilic or free radical in nature. Reactive functional groups include but are not limited to carboxyls hydroxyls para nitrophenylcarbonate isothiocyanate and leaving groups such as O mesyl O tosyl Cl Br I or maleimide.

For example a charged substituent such as sulfonate SO or ammonium may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab L antibody linker intermediate with D or D L drug linker intermediate with Ab depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.

Conjugates of the antibody and auristatin may be made using a variety of bifunctional linker reagents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene .

Bis maleimide reagents allow the attachment of the thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody to a thiol containing drug moiety label or linker intermediate in a sequential or concurrent fashion. Other functional groups besides maleimide which are reactive with a thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody drug moiety label or linker intermediate include iodoacetamide bromoacetamide vinyl pyridine disulfide pyridyl disulfide isocyanate and isothiocyanate.

Useful linker reagents can also be obtained via other commercial sources such as Molecular Biosciences Inc. Boulder Colo. or synthesized in accordance with procedures described in Toki et al 2002 J.

The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a cysteine group of a cysteine engineered antibody with a linker reagent to form antibody linker intermediate Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a linker reagent to form drug linker intermediate D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a cysteine group of a cysteine engineered antibody. Conjugation methods 1 and 2 may be employed with a variety of cysteine engineered antibodies drug moieties and linkers to prepare the antibody drug conjugates of Formula I.

Antibody cysteine thiol groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker reagents and drug linker intermediates including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups and iv disulfides including pyridyl disulfides via sulfide exchange. Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents.

Cysteine engineered antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT Cleland s reagent dithiothreitol or TCEP tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride Getz et al 1999 Anal. Biochem. Vol 273 73 80 Soltec Ventures Beverly Mass. followed by reoxidation to reform interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds Example 5 . For example full length cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies ThioMabs expressed in CHO cells are reduced with about a 50 fold molar excess of TCEP for 3 hrs at 37 C. to reduce disulfide bonds in cysteine adducts which may form between the newly introduced cysteine residues and the cysteine present in the culture media. The reduced ThioMab is diluted and loaded onto HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5 and eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. Disulfide bonds were reestablished between cysteine residues present in the parent Mab with dilute 200 nM aqueous copper sulfate CuSO at room temperature overnight. Alternatively dehydroascorbic acid DHAA is an effective oxidant to reestablish the intrachain disulfide groups of the cysteine engineered antibody after reductive cleavage of the cysteine adducts. Other oxidants i.e. oxidizing agents and oxidizing conditions which are known in the art may be used. Ambient air oxidation is also effective. This mild partial reoxidation step forms intrachain disulfides efficiently with high fidelity and preserves the thiol groups of the newly introduced cysteine residues. An approximate 10 fold excess of drug linker intermediate e.g. MC vc PAB MMAE was added mixed and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form the anti FcRH5 antibody drug conjugate. The conjugation mixture was gel filtered and loaded and eluted through a HiTrap S column to remove excess drug linker intermediate and other impurities.

A general process to prepare a cysteine engineered antibody expressed from cell culture for conjugation is as follows. When the cell culture media contains cysteine disulfide adducts can form between the newly introduced cysteine amino acid and cysteine from media. These cysteine adducts depicted as a circle in the exemplary ThioMab left in must be reduced to generate cysteine engineered antibodies reactive for conjugation. Cysteine adducts presumably along with various interchain disulfide bonds are reductively cleaved to give a reduced form of the antibody with reducing agents such as TCEP. The interchain disulfide bonds between paired cysteine residues are reformed under partial oxidation conditions with copper sulfate DHAA or exposure to ambient oxygen. The newly introduced engineered and unpaired cysteine residues remain available for reaction with linker reagents or drug linker intermediates to form the antibody conjugates of the invention. The ThioMabs expressed in mammalian cell lines result in externally conjugated Cys adduct to an engineered Cys through S S bond formation. Hence the purified ThioMabs are treated with the reduction and reoxidation procedures to produce reactive ThioMabs. These ThioMabs are used to conjugate with maleimide containing cytotoxic drugs fluorophores and other labels.

The anti FcRH5 antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

Techniques for generating antibodies that bind to FcRH5 polypeptides have been described above. One may further select antibodies with certain biological characteristics as desired.

The growth inhibitory effects of an anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention may be assessed by methods known in the art e.g. using cells which express a FcRH5 polypeptide either endogenously or following transfection with the FcRH5 gene. For example appropriate tumor cell lines and FcRH5 transfected cells may be treated with an anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibody of the invention at various concentrations for a few days e.g. 2 7 days and stained with crystal violet or MTT or analyzed by some other colorimetric assay. Another method of measuring proliferation would be by comparing H thymidine uptake by the cells treated in the presence or absence an anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention. After treatment the cells are harvested and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA quantitated in a scintillation counter. Appropriate positive controls include treatment of a selected cell line with a growth inhibitory antibody known to inhibit growth of that cell line. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways known in the art. The tumor cell may be one that overexpresses a FcRH5 polypeptide. The anti FcRH5 antibody will inhibit cell proliferation of a FcRH5 expressing tumor cell in vitro or in vivo by about 25 100 compared to the untreated tumor cell more preferably by about 30 100 and even more preferably by about 50 100 or 70 100 in one embodiment at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti FcRH5 antibody at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or reduction of tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

To select for an anti FcRH5 antibody which induces cell death loss of membrane integrity as indicated by e.g. propidium iodide PI trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. A PI uptake assay can be performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. FcRH5 polypeptide expressing tumor cells are incubated with medium alone or medium containing the appropriate anti FcRH5 antibody e.g at about 10 g ml . The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment cells are washed and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer capped 12 75 tubes 1 ml per tube 3 tubes per treatment group for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI 10 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those anti FcRH5 antibodies that induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake may be selected as cell death inducing anti FcRH5 antibodies.

To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on a FcRH5 polypeptide bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. This assay can be used to determine if a test antibody binds the same site or epitope as a known anti FcRH5 antibody. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example the antibody sequence can be mutagenized such as by alanine scanning to identify contact residues. The mutant antibody is initially tested for binding with polyclonal antibody to ensure proper folding. In a different method peptides corresponding to different regions of a FcRH5 polypeptide can be used in competition assays with the test antibodies or with a test antibody and an antibody with a characterized or known epitope.

Anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in Hoogenboom et al. 2001 in Methods in Molecular Biology 178 1 37 O Brien et al. ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. and in certain embodiments in Lee et al. 2004 J. Mol. Biol. 340 1073 1093.

In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti FcRH5 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3.

In certain embodiments the antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops HVRs or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones. 

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. EMBO J 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 388 1992 .

In certain embodiments filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti FcRH5 clones is desired the subject is immunized with FcRH5 to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti FcRH5 clones is obtained by generating an anti FcRH5 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that FcRH5 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against FcRH5. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for anti FcRH5 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing FcRH5 specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation using FcRH5 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled FcRH5 followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which FcRH5 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. Nature 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. Biotechnol. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Santry et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . In certain embodiments library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. J. Mol. Biol. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. Nature Genet. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter Eur. J. Immunol. 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. Gene 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity Kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. Technique 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 published 14 Mar. 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. Biotechnol. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10M or less.

Screening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example FcRH5 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized FcRH5 under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 or by FcRH5 antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1 000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. Biotechnol. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for FcRH5. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting FcRH5 rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated FcRH5 but with the biotinylated FcRH5 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for FcRH5. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.

Anti FcRH5 clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments the invention provides anti FcRH5 antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express FcRH5. In one embodiment the invention provides anti FcRH5 antibodies that block the binding between a FcRH5 ligand and FcRH5 but do not block the binding between a FcRH5 ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti FcRH5 antibodies can be selected by 1 isolating anti FcRH5 clones from a phage library as described above and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host 2 selecting FcRH5 and a second protein against which blocking and non blocking activity respectively is desired 3 adsorbing the anti FcRH5 phage clones to immobilized FcRH5 4 using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize FcRH5 binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein and 5 eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step 4 . Optionally clones with the desired blocking non blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.

DNA encoding hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. Curr. Opinion in Immunol. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun Immunol. Revs 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for full or partial length human heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding anti FcRH5 antibody derived from a hybridoma can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

The antibodies of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278.

The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.

The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the anti FcRH5 antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

In addition to the anti FcRH5 antibodies described herein it is contemplated that anti FcRH5 antibody variants can be prepared. Anti FcRH5 antibody variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the encoding DNA and or by synthesis of the desired antibody or polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post translational processes of the anti FcRH5 antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.

Variations in the anti FcRH5 antibodies described herein can be made for example using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non conservative mutations set forth for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5 364 934. Variations may be a substitution deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the antibody or polypeptide that results in a change in the amino acid sequence as compared with the native sequence antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the anti FcRH5 antibody. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the anti FcRH5 antibody with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine i.e. conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full length or mature native sequence.

Anti FcRH5 antibody fragments are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N terminus or C terminus or may lack internal residues for example when compared with a full length native antibody or protein. Certain fragments lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the anti FcRH5 antibody.

Anti FcRH5 antibody fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating antibody or polypeptide fragments by enzymatic digestion e.g. by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired antibody or polypeptide fragment by polymerase chain reaction PCR . Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5 and 3 primers in the PCR. Preferably anti FcRH5 antibody fragments share at least one biological and or immunological activity with the native anti FcRH5 antibody disclosed herein.

In particular embodiments conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 8 under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 8 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes are introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the anti FcRH5 antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis alanine scanning and PCR mutagenesis. Site directed mutagenesis Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 Zoller et al. 10 6487 1987 cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis Wells et al. 317 415 1986 or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the anti FcRH5 antibody variant DNA.

Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine glycine serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side chain beyond the beta carbon and is less likely to alter the main chain conformation of the variant Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. Chothia 150 1 1976 . If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant an isoteric amino acid can be used.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the anti FcRH5 antibody also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the anti FcRH5 antibody to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and FcRH5 polypeptide. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti FcRH5 antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the anti FcRH5 antibody.

Covalent modifications of anti FcRH5 antibodies are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of an anti FcRH5 antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues of the anti FcRH5 antibody. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for instance for crosslinking anti FcRH5 antibody to a water insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying anti FcRH5 antibodies and vice versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include e.g. 1 1 bis diazoacetyl 2 phenylethane glutaraldehyde N hydroxysuccinimide esters for example esters with 4 azidosalicylic acid homobifunctional imidoesters including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3 3 dithiobis succinimidylpropionate bifunctional maleimides such as bis N maleimido 1 8 octane and agents such as methyl 3 p azidophenyl dithio propioimidate.

Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues respectively hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group.

Another type of covalent modification of the anti FcRH5 antibody included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the antibody or polypeptide. Altering the native glycosylation pattern is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence anti FcRH5 antibody either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and or enzymatic means and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence anti FcRH5 antibody. In addition the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.

Glycosylation of antibodies and other polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the anti FcRH5 antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original anti FcRH5 antibody for O linked glycosylation sites . The anti FcRH5 antibody amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the anti FcRH5 antibody at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.

Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the anti FcRH5 antibody is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art e.g. in WO 87 05330 published 11 Sep. 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston . pp. 259 306 1981 .

Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the anti FcRH5 antibody may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described for instance by Hakimuddin et al. 259 52 1987 and by Edge et al. 118 131 1981 . Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo and exo glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. 138 350 1987 .

Another type of covalent modification of anti FcRH5 antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 640 835 4 496 689 4 301 144 4 670 417 4 791 192 or 4 179 337. The antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Oslo A. Ed. 1980 .

The anti FcRH5 antibody of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form chimeric molecules comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody fused to another heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence.

In one embodiment such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the anti FcRH5 antibody with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino or carboxyl terminus of the anti FcRH5 antibody. The presence of such epitope tagged forms of the anti FcRH5 antibody can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also provision of the epitope tag enables the anti FcRH5 antibody to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly histidine poly his or poly histidine glycine poly his gly tags the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 Field et al. 8 2159 2165 1988 the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4 B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. 5 3610 3616 1985 and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et al. 3 6 547 553 1990 . Other tag polypeptides include the Flag peptide Hopp et al. 6 1204 1210 1988 the KT3 epitope peptide Martin et al. 255 192 194 1992 an tubulin epitope peptide Skinner et al. 266 15163 15166 1991 and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag Lutz Freyermuth et al. 87 6393 6397 1990 .

In an alternative embodiment the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the anti FcRH5 antibody with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule also referred to as an immunoadhesin such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated form of an anti FcRH5 antibody in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge CHand CH or the hinge CH CHand CHregions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5 428 130 issued Jun. 27 1995.

The description below relates primarily to production of anti FcRH5 antibodies by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing anti FcRH5 antibody encoding nucleic acid. It is of course contemplated that alternative methods which are well known in the art may be employed to prepare anti FcRH5 antibodies. For instance the appropriate amino acid sequence or portions thereof may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques see e.g. Stewart et al. W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. 1969 Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished for instance using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer Foster City Calif. using manufacturer s instructions. Various portions of the anti FcRH5 antibody may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired anti FcRH5 antibody.

DNA encoding anti FcRH5 antibody may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the anti FcRH5 antibody mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly human anti FcRH5 antibody DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The anti FcRH5 antibody encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures e.g. automated nucleic acid synthesis .

Libraries can be screened with probes such as oligonucleotides of at least about 20 80 bases designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures such as described in Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding anti FcRH5 antibody is to use PCR methodology Sambrook et al. supra Dieffenbach et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1995 .

Techniques for screening a cDNA library are well known in the art. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art and include the use of radiolabels like P labeled ATP biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions including moderate stringency and high stringency are provided in Sambrook et al. supra.

Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity at either the amino acid or nucleotide level within defined regions of the molecule or across the full length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein.

Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time and if necessary using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al. supra to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse transcribed into cDNA.

Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for anti FcRH5 antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions such as media temperature pH and the like can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general principles protocols and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in M. Butler ed. IRL Press 1991 and Sambrook et al. supra.

Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation which means introduction of DNA into the host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal or by chromosomal integrant are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaCl CaPO liposome mediated polyethylene gycol DMSO and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride as described in Sambrook et al. supra or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells as described by Shaw et al. 23 315 1983 and WO 89 05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb 52 456 457 1978 can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 399 216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al. 130 946 1977 and Hsiao et al. . 76 3829 1979 . However other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear microinjection electroporation bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells or polycations e.g. polybrene polyornithine may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells see Keown et al. 185 527 537 1990 and Mansour et al. 336 348 352 1988 .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells.

Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to archaebacteria and eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as . Various strains are publicly available such as K12 strain MM294 ATCC 31 446 X1776 ATCC 31 537 strain W3110 ATCC 27 325 and K5 772 ATCC 53 635 . Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as Bacilli such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example strain W3110 Bachmann vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host with examples of such hosts including W3110 strain 1A2 which has the complete genotype tonA W3110 strain 9E4 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 W3110 strain 27C7 ATCC 55 244 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT kanW3110 strain 37D6 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kanW3110 strain 40B4 which is strain 37D6 with a non kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation W3110 strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kan U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 and an strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 783 issued 7 Aug. 1990. Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture. Alternatively in vitro methods of cloning e.g. PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions are suitable.

Full length antibody antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237 Carter et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 199 Joly et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523 Simmons et al. which describes translation initiation regio TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion these patents incorporated herein by reference. After expression the antibody is isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g. in CHO cells.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for anti FcRH5 antibody encoding vectors. is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Beach and Nurse 290 140 1981 EP 139 383 published 2 May 1985 hosts U.S. Pat. No. 4 943 529 Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 such as e.g. MW98 8C CBS683 CBS4574 Louvencourt et al. 154 2 737 742 1983 ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 Van den Berg et al. 8 135 1990 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 Sreekrishna et al. 28 265 278 1988 EP 244 234 Case et al. 76 5259 5263 1979 such as EP 394 538 published 31 Oct. 1990 and filamentous fungi such as e.g. WO 91 00357 published 10 Jan. 1991 and hosts such as Ballance et al. 112 284 289 1983 Tilburn et al. 26 205 221 1983 Yelton et al. 81 1470 1474 1984 and Kelly and Hynes 4 475 479 1985 . Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include but are not limited to yeast capable of growth on methanol selected from the genera consisting of and . A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony 269 1982 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated anti FcRH5 antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 as well as plant cells such as cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato and tobacco. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TRI cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for anti FcRH5 antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid e.g. cDNA or genomic DNA encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin.

The vector may for example be in the form of a plasmid cosmid viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site s using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.

The FcRH5 may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the anti FcRH5 antibody encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase 1 pp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be e.g. the yeast invertase leader alpha factor leader including and factor leaders the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 010 182 or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader EP 362 179 published 4 Apr. 1990 or the signal described in WO 90 13646 published 15 Nov. 1990. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species as well as viral secretory leaders.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 which contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al. 275 615 1978 Goeddel et al. 281 544 1979 alkaline phosphatase a tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel 8 4057 1980 EP 36 776 and hybrid promoters such as the tac deBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 or the trc promoter. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding anti FcRH5 antibody. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun 159 203 1995 .

The present invention provides an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.

One technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region TIR within a cistron. For a given TIR a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence although silent changes in the nucleotide sequence are preferred. Alterations in the TIR can include for example alterations in the number or spacing of Shine Dalgarno sequences along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a codon bank at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence i.e. the changes are silent . This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon additionally some amino acids such as leucine serine and arginine have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. 1992 METHODS 4 151 158.

Preferably a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523. Based on the translational strength comparison the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for Bacilli.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the anti FcRH5 antibody encoding nucleic acid such as DHFR or thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 . For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp 1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. Nature 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al. 7 141 1979 Tschemper et al. 10 157 1980 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones 85 12 1977 .

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the anti FcRH5 antibody encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known.

Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al. 255 2073 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess et al. 7 149 1968 Holland 17 4900 1978 such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657.

Anti FcRH5 antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus UK 2 211 504 published 5 Jul. 1989 adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter and from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. See also Reyes et al. Nature 297 598 601 1982 on expression of human interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of a DNA encoding the anti FcRH5 antibody by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the anti FcRH5 antibody coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding anti FcRH5 antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Still other methods vectors and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of anti FcRH5 antibody in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al. 293 620 625 1981 Mantei et al. 281 40 46 1979 EP 117 060 and EP 117 058.

The host cells used to produce the anti FcRH5 antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay. In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an ODof about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 39 199 210.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

Gene amplification and or expression may be measured in a sample directly for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization using an appropriately labeled probe based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.

Gene expression alternatively may be measured by immunological methods such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently the antibodies may be prepared against a native sequence FcRH5 polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to FcRH5 DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.

Forms of anti FcRH5 antibody may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane bound it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution e.g. Triton X 100 or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of anti FcRH5 antibody can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means such as freeze thaw cycling sonication mechanical disruption or cell lysing agents.

It may be desired to purify anti FcRH5 antibody from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures by fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SD S PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75 protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG and metal chelating columns to bind epitope tagged forms of the anti FcRH5 antibody. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher 182 1990 Scopes Springer Verlag New York 1982 . The purification step s selected will depend for example on the nature of the production process used and the particular anti FcRH5 antibody produced.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. EMBO J. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally i.e. infusion subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal and epidural.

For treating these cancers in one embodiment the antibody drug conjugate is administered via intravenous infusion. The dosage administered via infusion is in the range of about 1 g mto about 10 000 g mper dose generally one dose per week for a total of one two three or four doses. Alternatively the dosage range is of about 1 g mto about 1000 g m about 1 g mto about 800 g m about 1 g mto about 600 g m about 1 g mto about 400 g m about 10 g mto about 500 g m about 10 g mto about 300 g m about 10 g mto about 200 g m and about 1 g mto about 200 g m. The dose may be administered once per day once per week multiple times per week but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per week once per month or intermittently to relieve or alleviate symptoms of the disease. Administration may continue at any of the disclosed intervals until remission of the tumor or symptoms of the lymphoma leukemia being treated. Administration may continue after remission or relief of symptoms is achieved where such remission or relief is prolonged by such continued administration.

The invention also provides a method of alleviating an autoimmune disease comprising administering to a patient suffering from the autoimmune disease a therapeutically effective amount of a humanized 13G9 antibody drug conjugate of any one of the preceding embodiments. In preferred embodiments the antibody is administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The antibody drug conjugate is administered intravenously at a dosage in the range of about 1 g mto about 100 mg mper dose and in a specific embodiment the dosage is 1 g mto about 500 g m. The dose may be administered once per day once per week multiple times per week but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per week once per month or intermittently to relieve or alleviate symptoms of the disease. Administration may continue at any of the disclosed intervals until relief from or alleviation of symptoms of the autoimmune disease being treated. Administration may continue after relief from or alleviation of symptoms is achieved where such alleviation or relief is prolong by such continued administration.

The invention also provides a method of treating a B cell disorder comprising administering to a patient suffering from a B cell disorder such as a B cell proliferative disorder including without limitation lymphoma and leukemia or an autoimmune disease a therapeutically effective amount of a humanized 13G9 antibody of any one of the preceding embodiments which antibody is not conjugated to a cytotoxic molecule or a detectable molecule. The anatibody will typically be administered in a dosage range of about 1 g mto about 1000 mg m.

In one aspect the invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention and or at least one immunoconjugate thereof and or at least one anti FcRH5 antibody drug conjugate of the invention. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1 an antibody of the invention and or an immunoconjugate thereof and 2 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1 an antibody of the invention and or an immunoconjugate thereof and optionally 2 at least one additional therapeutic agent. Additional therapeutic agents include but are not limited to those described below. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally i.e. infusion subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal and epidural.

Therapeutic formulations comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody or FcRH5 immunoconjugate used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or immunoconjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as acetate Tris phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides 

proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA tonicifiers such as trehalose and sodium chloride sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol surfactant such as polysorbate salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . Pharmaceutical formulations to be used for in vivo administration are generally sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

The formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example in addition to an anti FcRH5 antibody it may be desirable to include in the one formulation an additional antibody e.g. a second anti FcRH5 antibody which binds a different epitope on the FcRH5 polypeptide or an antibody to some other target such as a growth factor that affects the growth of the particular cancer. Alternatively or additionally the composition may further comprise a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

An antibody may be formulated in any suitable form for delivery to a target cell tissue. For example antibodies may be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

To determine FcRH5 expression in the cancer various detection assays are available. In one embodiment FcRH5 polypeptide overexpression may be analyzed by immunohistochemistry IHC . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a FcRH5 protein staining intensity criteria as follows 

Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for FcRH5 polypeptide expression may be characterized as not overexpressing FcRH5 whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing FcRH5.

Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM sold by Ventana Ariz. or PATHVISION Vysis Ill. may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of FcRH5 overexpression in the tumor.

FcRH5 overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo detection assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

As described above the anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention have various non therapeutic applications. The anti FcRH5 antibodies of the present invention can be useful for staging of FcRH5 polypeptide expressing cancers e.g. in radioimaging . The antibodies are also useful for purification or immunoprecipitation of FcRH5 polypeptide from cells for detection and quantitation of FcRH5 polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot to kill and eliminate FcRH5 expressing cells from a population of mixed cells as a step in the purification of other cells.

Currently depending on the stage of the cancer cancer treatment involves one or a combination of the following therapies surgery to remove the cancerous tissue radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anti FcRH5 antibody therapy may be especially desirable in elderly patients who do not tolerate the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy well and in metastatic disease where radiation therapy has limited usefulness. The tumor targeting anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention are useful to alleviate FcRH5 expressing cancers upon initial diagnosis of the disease or during relapse. For therapeutic applications the anti FcRH5 antibody can be used alone or in combination therapy with e.g. hormones antiangiogens or radiolabelled compounds or with surgery cryotherapy and or radiotherapy. Anti FcRH5 antibody treatment can be administered in conjunction with other forms of conventional therapy either consecutively with pre or post conventional therapy. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as TAXOTERE docetaxel TAXOL palictaxel estramustine and mitoxantrone are used in treating cancer in particular in good risk patients. In the present method of the invention for treating or alleviating cancer the cancer patient can be administered anti FcRH5 antibody in conjunction with treatment with the one or more of the preceding chemotherapeutic agents. In particular combination therapy with palictaxel and modified derivatives see e.g. EP0600517 is contemplated. The anti FcRH5 antibody will be administered with a therapeutically effective dose of the chemotherapeutic agent. In another embodiment the anti FcRH5 antibody is administered in conjunction with chemotherapy to enhance the activity and efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent e.g. paclitaxel. The Physicians Desk Reference PDR discloses dosages of these agents that have been used in treatment of various cancers. The dosing regimen and dosages of these aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs that are therapeutically effective will depend on the particular cancer being treated the extent of the disease and other factors familiar to the physician of skill in the art and can be determined by the physician.

In one particular embodiment a conjugate comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. Preferably the immunoconjugate bound to the FcRH5 protein is internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with the nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents are described above and include maytansinoids calicheamicins ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.

The anti FcRH5 antibodies or toxin conjugates thereof are administered to a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the antibody is preferred.

An ex vivo strategy can also be used for therapeutic applications. Ex vivo strategies involve transfecting or transducing cells obtained from the subject with a polynucleotide encoding a FcRH5 antagonist. The transfected or transduced cells are then returned to the subject. The cells can be any of a wide range of types including without limitation hemopoietic cells e.g. bone marrow cells macrophages monocytes dendritic cells T cells or B cells fibroblasts epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes or muscle cells.

For example if the FcRH5 antagonist is an antibody or immunoconjugate the antagonist is administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antagonist is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferably the dosing is given by injections most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

In another example the FcRH5 antagonist compound is administered locally e.g. by direct injections when the disorder or location of the tumor permits and the injections can be repeated periodically. The FcRH5 antagonist can also be delivered systemically to the subject or directly to the tumor cells e.g. to a tumor or a tumor bed following surgical excision of the tumor in order to prevent or reduce local recurrence or metastasis.

Administration of the therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period usually minutes hours days or weeks depending upon the combination selected . Combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner that is wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time as well as administration of these therapeutic agents or at least two of the therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner.

The therapeutic agent can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example the anti FcRH antibody or immunoconjugate in the combination may be administered by intravenous injection while a chemotherapeutic agent in the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively for example both of the therapeutic agents may be administered orally or both therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection depending on the specific therapeutic agents. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered also varies depending on the specific agents.

Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg of each therapeutic agent is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until the cancer is treated as measured by the methods described above. However other dosage regimens may be useful.

The present application contemplates administration of the anti FcRH5 antibody by gene therapy. See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the anti FcRH5 antibody. The combined administration includes co administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect.

It may also be desirable to combine administration of the anti FcRH5 antibody or antibodies with administration of an antibody directed against another tumor antigen associated with the particular cancer.

In another embodiment the therapeutic treatment methods of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anti FcRH5 antibody or antibodies and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including co administration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents or other cytotoxic agent s or other therapeutic agent s which also inhibits tumor growth. Chemotherapeutic agents include estramustine phosphate prednimustine cisplatin 5 fluorouracil melphalan cyclophosphamide hydroxyurea and hydroxyureataxanes such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel and or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1992 . The antibody may be combined with an anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen an anti progesterone such as onapristone see EP 616 812 or an anti androgen such as flutamide in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is androgen independent cancer the patient may previously have been subjected to anti androgen therapy and after the cancer becomes androgen independent the anti FcRH5 antibody and optionally other agents as described herein may be administered to the patient.

Sometimes it may be beneficial to also co administer a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent such as an antibody before simultaneously with or post antibody therapy. Suitable dosages for any of the above co administered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the agent and anti FcRH5 antibody.

The antibody composition of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the dosage and mode of administration will be chosen by the physician according to known criteria. The appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Preferably the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injections. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to about 50 mg kg body weight e.g. about 0.1 15 mg kg dose of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the anti FcRH5 antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. The progress of this therapy can be readily monitored by conventional methods and assays and based on criteria known to the physician or other persons of skill in the art.

Aside from administration of the antibody protein to the patient the present application contemplates administration of the antibody by gene therapy. Such administration of nucleic acid encoding the antibody is encompassed by the expression administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody . See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

There are two major approaches to getting the nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector into the patient s cells in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment the patient s cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retroviral vector.

The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 . See also WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein.

The anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention can be in the different forms encompassed by the definition of antibody herein. Thus the antibodies include full length or intact antibody antibody fragments native sequence antibody or amino acid variants humanized chimeric or fusion antibodies immunoconjugates and functional fragments thereof. In fusion antibodies an antibody sequence is fused to a heterologous polypeptide sequence. The antibodies can be modified in the Fc region to provide desired effector functions. As discussed in more detail in the sections herein with the appropriate Fc regions the naked antibody bound on the cell surface can induce cytotoxicity e.g. via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC or by recruiting complement in complement dependent cytotoxicity or some other mechanism. Alternatively where it is desirable to eliminate or reduce effector function so as to minimize side effects or therapeutic complications certain other Fc regions may be used.

In one embodiment the antibody competes for binding or bind substantially to the same epitope as the antibodies of the invention. Antibodies having the biological characteristics of the present anti FcRH5 antibodies of the invention are also contemplated specifically including the in vivo tumor targeting and any cell proliferation inhibition or cytotoxic characteristics.

The present anti FcRH5 antibodies are useful for treating a FcRH5 expressing cancer or alleviating one or more symptoms of the cancer in a mammal. Such a cancer includes but is not limited to hematopoietic cancers or blood related cancers such as lymphoma leukemia myeloma or lymphoid malignancies but also cancers of the spleen and cancers of the lymph nodes. More particular examples of such B cell associated cancers including for example high intermediate and low grade lymphomas including B cell lymphomas such as for example mucosa associated lymphoid tissue B cell lymphoma and non Hodgkin s lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma diffuse large cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and Hodgkin s lymphoma and T cell lymphomas and leukemias including secondary leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia such as B cell leukemia CD5 B lymphocytes myeloid leukemia such as acute myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia lymphoid leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplasia and other hematological and or B cell or T cell associated cancers. The cancers encompass metastatic cancers of any of the preceding. The antibody is able to bind to at least a portion of the cancer cells that express FcRH5 polypeptide in the mammal. In a preferred embodiment the antibody is effective to destroy or kill FcRH5 expressing tumor cells or inhibit the growth of such tumor cells in vitro or in vivo upon binding to FcRH5 polypeptide on the cell. Such an antibody includes a naked anti FcRH5 antibody not conjugated to any agent . Naked antibodies that have cytotoxic or cell growth inhibition properties can be further harnessed with a cytotoxic agent to render them even more potent in tumor cell destruction. Cytotoxic properties can be conferred to an anti FcRH5 antibody by e.g. conjugating the antibody with a cytotoxic agent to form an immunoconjugate as described herein. The cytotoxic agent or a growth inhibitory agent is preferably a small molecule. Toxins such as calicheamicin or a maytansinoid and analogs or derivatives thereof are preferable.

The invention provides a composition comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention and a carrier. For the purposes of treating cancer compositions can be administered to the patient in need of such treatment wherein the composition can comprise one or more anti FcRH5 antibodies present as an immunoconjugate or as the naked antibody. In a further embodiment the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with other therapeutic agents such as cytotoxic or growth inhibitory agents including chemotherapeutic agents. The invention also provides formulations comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention and a carrier. In one embodiment the formulation is a therapeutic formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Another aspect of the invention is isolated nucleic acids encoding the anti FcRH5 antibodies. Nucleic acids encoding both the H and L chains and especially the hypervariable region residues chains which encode the native sequence antibody as well as variants modifications and humanized versions of the antibody are encompassed.

The invention also provides methods useful for treating a FcRH5 polypeptide expressing cancer or alleviating one or more symptoms of the cancer in a mammal comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term acute or chronic or intermittent as directed by physician. Also provided are methods of inhibiting the growth of and killing a FcRH5 polypeptide expressing cell.

The invention also provides kits and articles of manufacture comprising at least one anti FcRH5 antibody. Kits containing anti FcRH5 antibodies find use e.g. for FcRH5 cell killing assays for purification or immunoprecipitation of FcRH5 polypeptide from cells. For example for isolation and purification of FcRH5 the kit can contain an anti FcRH5 antibody coupled to beads e.g. sepharose beads . Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies for detection and quantitation of FcRH5 in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot. Such antibody useful for detection may be provided with a label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel.

It is contemplated that the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors leukemia and lymphoid malignancies. Others include neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal blastocoelic inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic including autoimmune disorders.

The ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell based assays can be further tested in tumor bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed to test the efficacy of the anti FcRH5 monoclonal antibody or immunoconjugate of the invetion in patients experiencing a B cell proliferative disorder including without limitation lymphoma non Hodgkins lymphoma NHL aggressive NHL relapsed aggressive NHL relapsed indolent NHL refractory NHL refractory indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and mantle cell lymphoma. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens such as radiation and or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and or cytotoxic agents.

Generally the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as a B cell proliferative disorder and or a B cell cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include but are not limited to B cell proliferative disorder is selected from lymphoma non Hodgkins lymphoma NHL aggressive NHL relapsed aggressive NHL relapsed indolent NHL refractory NHL refractory indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.

The cancer may comprise FcRH5 expressing cells such that the ADC of the present invention are able to bind to the cancer cells. To determine FcRH5 expression in the cancer various diagnostic prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment FcRH5 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC. Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a FcRH5 protein staining intensity criteria with respect to the degree of staining and in what proportion of tumor cells examined.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight.

For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of an anti ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

An antibody drug conjugate ADC of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound having anti cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.

The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin forming inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor or a DNA binder.

In one aspect the first compound is an anti FcRH5 ADC of the invention and the second compound is an anti CD20 antibody either a naked antibody or an ADC . In one embodiment the second compound is an anti CD20 antibody rituximab Rituxan or 2H7 Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. . Another antibodies useful for combined immunotherapy with anti FcRH5 ADCs of the invention includes without limitation anti VEGF e.g Avastin .

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention including without limitation radiation therapy and or bone marrow and peripheral blood transplants and or a cytotoxic agent a chemotherapeutic agent or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents such as for example cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin adriamycin doxorubincin vincristine Oncovin prednisolone CHOP CVP or COP or immunotherapeutics such as anti CD20 e.g. Rituxan or anti VEGF e.g. Avastin .

The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

In one embodiment treatment with an ADC involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel and or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer s instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service 1992 Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

The combination therapy of the invention can further comprise one or more chemotherapeutic agent s . The combined administration includes coadministration or concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

The chemotherapeutic agent if administered is usually administered at dosages known therefor or optionally lowered due to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner.

Another embodiment of the invention is an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment prevention and or diagnosis of FcRH5 expressing cancer. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating preventing and or diagnosing the cancer condition and may have a sterile access port for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle . At least one active agent in the composition is an anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating cancer. The label or package insert will further comprise instructions for administering the antibody composition to the cancer patient. Additionally the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer such as bacteriostatic water for injection BWFI phosphate buffered saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint including other buffers diluents filters needles and syringes.

Kits are also provided that are useful for various purposes e.g. for FcRH5 expressing cell killing assays for purification or immunoprecipitation of FcRH5 polypeptide from cells. For isolation and purification of FcRH5 polypeptide the kit can contain an anti FcRH5 antibody coupled to beads e.g. sepharose beads . Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies for detection and quantitation of FcRH5 polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot. As with the article of manufacture the kit comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. The container holds a composition comprising at least one anti FcRH5 antibody of the invention. Additional containers may be included that contain e.g. diluents and buffers control antibodies. The label or package insert may provide a description of the composition as well as instructions for the intended in vitro or detection use.

This invention encompasses methods of screening compounds to identify those that mimic the FcRH5 polypeptide agonists or prevent the effect of the FcRH5 polypeptide antagonists . Screening assays for antagonist drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the FcRH5 polypeptides encoded by the genes identified herein or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins including e.g. inhibiting the expression of FcRH5 polypeptide from cells. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high throughput screening of chemical libraries making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.

The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a FcRH5 polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.

In binding assays the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment the FcRH5 polypeptide encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase e.g. on a microtiter plate by covalent or non covalent attachments. Non covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the FcRH5 polypeptide and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody e.g. a monoclonal antibody specific for the FcRH5 polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non immobilized component which may be labeled by a detectable label to the immobilized component e.g. the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete the non reacted components are removed e.g. by washing and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non immobilized component carries a detectable label the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non immobilized component does not carry a label complexing can be detected for example by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.

If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular FcRH5 polypeptide encoded by a gene identified herein its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches such as e.g. cross linking co immunoprecipitation and co purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition protein protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast based genetic system described by Fields and co workers Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 Chien et al. 88 9578 9582 1991 as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans 89 5789 5793 1991 . Many transcriptional activators such as yeast GAL4 consist of two physically discrete modular domains one acting as the DNA binding domain the other one functioning as the transcription activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications generally referred to as the two hybrid system takes advantage of this property and employs two hybrid proteins one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and another in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1 lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4 activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for galactosidase. A complete kit MATCHMAKER for identifying protein protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.

Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a FcRH5 polypeptide identified herein and other intra or extracellular components can be tested as follows usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture to serve as positive control. The binding complex formation between the test compound and the intra or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction s but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.

To assay for antagonists the FcRH5 polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the FcRH5 polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the FcRH5 polypeptide. Alternatively antagonists may be detected by combining the FcRH5 polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane bound FcRH5 polypeptide receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The FcRH5 polypeptide can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of FcRH5 polypeptide molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Preferably expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the FcRH5 polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the FcRH5 polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled FcRH5 polypeptide. The FcRH5 polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and re transfected using an interactive sub pooling and re screening process eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification labeled FcRH5 polypeptide can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein micro sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.

In another assay for antagonists mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would be incubated with labeled FcRH5 polypeptide in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with FcRH5 polypeptide and in particular antibodies including without limitation poly and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments single chain antibodies anti idiotypic antibodies and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein for example a mutated form of the FcRH5 polypeptide that recognizes the receptor but imparts no effect thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the FcRH5 polypeptide.

Antibodies specifically binding a FcRH5 polypeptide identified herein as well as other molecules identified by the screening assays disclosed hereinbefore can be administered for the treatment of various disorders including cancer in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.

If the FcRH5 polypeptide is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors internalizing antibodies are preferred. However lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody or an antibody fragment into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively or in addition the composition may comprise an agent that enhances its function such as for example a cytotoxic agent cytokine chemotherapeutic agent or growth inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymers are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

Yet another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of determining the presence of a FcRH5 polypeptide in a sample suspected of containing the FcRH5 polypeptide wherein the method comprises exposing the sample to an antibody drug conjugate thereof that binds to the FcRH5 polypeptide and determining binding of the antibody drug conjugate thereof to the FcRH5 polypeptide in the sample wherein the presence of such binding is indicative of the presence of the FcRH5 polypeptide in the sample. Optionally the sample may contain cells which may be cancer cells suspected of expressing the FcRH5 polypeptide. The antibody drug conjugate thereof employed in the method may optionally be detectably labeled attached to a solid support or the like.

Optionally the antibody drug conjugate thereof is detectably labeled attached to a solid support or the like and or the test sample of tissue cells is obtained from an individual suspected of having a cancerous tumor.

The term detecting as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue. In certain embodiments such tissues include normal and or cancerous tissues that express FcRH5 at higher levels relative to other tissues for example B cells and or B cell associated tissues.

In one aspect the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of FcRH5 in a biological sample. In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti FcRH5 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti FcRH5 antibody to FcRH5 and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti FcRH5 antibody and FcRH5.

In one aspect the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disorder associated with increased expression of FcRH5. In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting a test cell with an anti FcRH5 antibody determining the level of expression either quantitatively or qualitatively of FcRH5 by the test cell by detecting binding of the anti FcRH5 antibody to FcRH5 and comparing the level of expression of FcRH5 by the test cell with the level of expression of FcRH5 by a control cell e.g. a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses FcRH5 at levels comparable to such a normal cell wherein a higher level of expression of FcRH5 by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of FcRH5. In certain embodiments the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased expression of FcRH5. In certain embodiments the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder such as a cancer or a tumor.

Exemplary cell proliferative disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include a B cell disorder and or a B cell proliferative disorder including but not limited to lymphoma non Hodgkins lymphoma NHL aggressive NHL relapsed aggressive NHL relapsed indolent NHL refractory NHL refractory indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.

In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting a cell with an anti FcRH5 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti FcRH5 antibody to FcRH5 and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti FcRH5 antibody and FcRH5 on the cell surface. An exemplary assay for detecting binding of an anti FcRH5 antibody to FcRH5 expressed on the surface of a cell is a FACS assay.

Certain other methods can be used to detect binding of anti FcRH5 antibodies to FcRH5.

In certain embodiments anti FcRH5 antibodies are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization entails separating the anti FcRH5 antibody from any FcRH5 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti FcRH5 antibody before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 or by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti FcRH5 antibody after formation of a complex between the anti FcRH5 antibody and FcRH5 e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

Any of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti FcRH5 antibody.

An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be used in for example in vitro ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods. In one aspect the invention provides methods for inhibiting cell growth or proliferation either in vivo or in vitro the method comprising exposing a cell to an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof under conditions permissive for binding of the immunoconjugate to FcRH5. Inhibiting cell growth or proliferation means decreasing a cell s growth or proliferation by at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 100 and includes inducing cell death. In certain embodiments the cell is a tumor cell. In certain embodiments the cell is a B cell. In certain embodiments the cell is a xenograft e.g. as exemplified herein.

In one aspect an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is used to treat or prevent a B cell proliferative disorder. In certain embodiments the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression and or activity of FcRH5. For example in certain embodiments the B cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression of FcRH5 on the surface of a B cell. In certain embodiments the B cell proliferative disorder is a tumor or a cancer. Examples of B cell proliferative disorders to be treated by the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention include but are not limited to lymphoma non Hodgkins lymphoma NHL aggressive NHL relapsed aggressive NHL relapsed indolent NHL refractory NHL refractory indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for treating a B cell proliferative disorder comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof. In certain embodiments a method for treating a B cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody or anti FcRH5 immunoconjugate and optionally at least one additional therapeutic agent such as those provided below. In certain embodiments a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 1 an immunoconjugate comprising an anti FcRH5 antibody and a cytotoxic agent and optionally 2 at least one additional therapeutic agent such as those provided below.

In one aspect at least some of the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can bind FcRH5 from species other than human. Accordingly antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used to bind FcRH5 e.g. in a cell culture containing FcRH5 in humans or in other mammals having a FcRH5 with which an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention cross reacts e.g. chimpanzee baboon marmoset cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys pig or mouse . In one embodiment an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used for targeting FcRH5 on B cells by contacting the antibody or immunoconjugate with FcRH5 to form an antibody or immunoconjugate antigen complex such that a conjugated cytotoxin of the immunoconjugate accesses the interior of the cell. In one embodiment the FcRH5 is human FcRH5.

In one embodiment an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used in a method for binding FcRH5 in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased FcRH5 expression and or activity the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody or immunoconjugate such that FcRH5 in the individual is bound. In one embodiment the bound antibody or immunoconjugate is internalized into the B cell expressing FcRH5. In one embodiment the FcRH5 is human FcRH5 and the individual is a human individual. Alternatively the individual can be a mammal expressing FcRH5 to which an anti FcRH5 antibody binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which FcRH5 has been introduced e.g. by administration of FcRH5 or by expression of a transgene encoding FcRH5 .

An anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a human for therapeutic purposes. Moreover an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a non human mammal expressing FcRH5 with which the antibody cross reacts e.g. a primate pig rat or mouse for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention e.g. testing of dosages and time courses of administration .

Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be co administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and or adjuvant. In certain embodiments an additional therapeutic agent is a cytotoxic agent a chemotherapeutic agent or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents such as for example cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin adriamycin doxorubincin vincristine Oncovin prednisolone CHOP CVP or COP or immunotherapeutics such as anti CD20 e.g. Rituxan or anti VEGF e.g. Avastin wherein the combination therapy is useful in the treatment of cancers and or B cell disorders such as B cell proliferative disorders including lymphoma non Hodgkins lymphoma NHL aggressive NHL relapsed aggressive NHL relapsed indolent NHL refractory NHL refractory indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.

Such combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention can occur prior to simultaneously and or following administration of the additional therapeutic agent and or adjuvant. Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.

An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant can be administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention would be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody or immunoconjugate need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or immunoconjugate present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages described herein or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically clinically determined to be appropriate.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents such as chemotherapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody or immunoconjugate the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody or immunoconjugate is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody or immunoconjugate and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 20 mg kg of antibody or immunoconjugate can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody or immunoconjugate would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof of antibody or immunoconjugate may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

Anti FcRH5 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention may be characterized for their physical chemical properties and or biological activities by various assays known in the art.

In one aspect assays are provided for identifying anti FcRH5 antibodies or immunoconjugates thereof having biological activity. Biological activity may include e.g. the ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation e.g. cell killing activity or the ability to induce cell death including programmed cell death apoptosis . Antibodies or immunoconjugates having such biological activity in vivo and or in vitro are also provided.

In certain embodiments an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vitro. Assays for inhibition of cell growth or proliferation are well known in the art. Certain assays for cell proliferation exemplified by the cell killing assays described herein measure cell viability. One such assay is the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay which is commercially available from Promega Madison Wis. . That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present which is an indication of metabolically active cells. See Crouch et al 1993 J. Immunol. Meth. 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677. The assay may be conducted in 96 or 384 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS . See Cree et al 1995 AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units RLU .

Another assay for cell proliferation is the MTT assay a colorimetric assay that measures the oxidation of 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan by mitochondrial reductase. Like the CellTiter Glo assay this assay indicates the number of metabolically active cells present in a cell culture. See e.g. Mosmann 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 65 55 63 and Zhang et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 3877 3882.

In one aspect an anti FcRH5 antibody is tested for its ability to induce cell death in vitro. Assays for induction of cell death are well known in the art. In some embodiments such assays measure e.g. loss of membrane integrity as indicated by uptake of propidium iodide PI trypan blue see Moore et al. 1995 Cytotechnology 17 1 11 or 7AAD. In an exemplary PI uptake assay cells are cultured in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium D MEM Ham s F 12 50 50 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FBS Hyclone and 2 mM L glutamine. Thus the assay is performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Cells are seeded at a density of 3 10per dish in 100 20 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing various concentrations of the antibody or immunoconjugate. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following treatment monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C. the pellet resuspended in 3 ml cold Ca binding buffer 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 140 mM NaCl 2.5 mM CaCl and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer capped 12 75 mm tubes 1 ml per tube 3 tubes per treatment group for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI 10 g ml . Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Antibodies or immunoconjugates which induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake are thus identified.

In one aspect an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate is tested for its ability to induce apoptosis programmed cell death in vitro. An exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is an annexin binding assay. In an exemplary annexin binding assay cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 0.001 to 10 g ml of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Following a three day incubation period monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged resuspended in Ca binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Tubes then receive labeled annexin e.g. annexin V FITC 1 g ml . Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software BD Biosciences . Antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are thus identified. Another exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is a histone DNA ELISA colorimetric assay for detecting internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. Such an assay can be performed using e.g. the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit Roche Palo Alto Calif. .

Cells for use in any of the above in vitro assays include cells or cell lines that naturally express FcRH5 or that have been engineered to express FcRH5. Such cells include tumor cells that overexpress FcRH5 relative to normal cells of the same tissue origin. Such cells also include cell lines including tumor cell lines that express FcRH5 and cell lines that do not normally express FcRH5 but have been transfected with nucleic acid encoding FcRH5.

In one aspect an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vivo. In certain embodiments an anti FcRH5 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. In vivo model systems such as xenograft models can be used for such testing. In an exemplary xenograft system human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non human animal e.g. a SCID mouse. An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is administered to the animal. The ability of the antibody or immunoconjugate to inhibit or decrease tumor growth is measured. In certain embodiments of the above xenograft system the human tumor cells are tumor cells from a human patient. Such cells useful for preparing xenograft models include human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines which include without limitation the BJAB luc cells an EBV negative Burkitt s lymphoma cell line transfected with the luciferase reporter gene Ramos cells ATCC Manassas Va. CRL 1923 SuDHL 4 cells DSMZ Braunschweig Germany AAC 495 DoHH2 cells see Kluin Neilemans H. C. et al. Leukemia 5 221 224 1991 and Kluin Neilemans H. C. et al. Leukemia 8 1385 1391 1994 Granta 519 cells see Jadayel D. M. et al Leukemia 11 1 64 72 1997 . In certain embodiments the human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non human animal by subcutaneous injection or by transplantation into a suitable site such as a mammary fat pad.

In one aspect an anti FcRH5 antibody is tested for its antigen binding activity. For example in certain embodiments an anti FcRH5 antibody is tested for its ability to bind to FcRH5 expressed on the surface of a cell. A FACS assay may be used for such testing.

In one aspect competition assays may be used to identify a monoclonal antibody that competes with murine 13G9 antibody mu13G9 humanized 13G9 antibody and or humanized 13G9.v1 and or humanized 13G9.v3 and or humanized 13G9.v8 antibody for binding to FcRH5. In certain embodiments such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope e.g. a linear or a conformational epitope that is bound by murine 13G9 antibody humanized 13G9.v1 antibody and or humanized 13G9.v3 antibody and or humanized 13G9.v8. Exemplary competition assays include but are not limited to routine assays such as those provided in Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual ch.14 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. . Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris 1996 Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 Humana Press Totowa N.J. . Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50 or more.

In an exemplary competition assay immobilized FcRH5 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to FcRH5 e.g. murine 13G9 mu13G9 antibody chimeric 13G9 ch13G9 and or humanized 13G9 hu13G9 antibody and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to FcRH5. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control immobilized FcRH5 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to FcRH5 excess unbound antibody is removed and the amount of label associated with immobilized FcRH5 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized FcRH5 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to FcRH5. In certain embodiments immobilized FcRH5 is present on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing FcRH5 on its surface.

In one aspect purified anti FcRH5 antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In one embodiment the invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 . Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.

The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.

All patent and literature references cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Commercially available reagents referred to in the examples were used according to manufacturer s instructions unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used in the examples are commercially available antibodies or antibodies described herein. The source of those cells identified in the following examples and throughout the specification by ATCC accession numbers is the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va.

Techniques for producing the monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and are described for instance in Goding supra. Immunogens that may be employed include purified FcRH5 fusion proteins containing FcRH5 and cells expressing recombinant FcRH5 on the cell surface. Selection of the immunogen can be made by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation.

Mice such as Balb c are immunized with the FcRH5 immunogen emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in an amount from 1 100 micrograms. Alternatively the immunogen is emulsified in MPL TDM adjuvant Ribi Immunochemical Research Hamilton Mont. and injected into the animal s hind foot pads. The immunized mice are then boosted 10 to 12 days later with additional immunogen emulsified in the selected adjuvant. Thereafter for several weeks the mice may also be boosted with additional immunization injections. Serum samples may be periodically obtained from the mice by retro orbital bleeding for testing in ELISA assays to detect anti FcRH5 antibodies.

After a suitable antibody titer has been detected the animals positive for antibodies can be injected with a final intravenous injection of immunogen. Three to four days later the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells are harvested. The spleen cells are then fused using 35 polyethylene glycol to a selected murine myeloma cell line such as P3X63AgU.1 available from ATCC No. CRL 1597. The fusions generate hybridoma cells which can then be plated in 96 well tissue culture plates containing HAT hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine medium to inhibit proliferation of non fused cells myeloma hybrids and spleen cell hybrids.

The hybridoma cells will be screened in an ELISA for reactivity against immunogen. Determination of positive hybridoma cells secreting the desired monoclonal antibodies against immunogen is within the skill in the art.

The positive hybridoma cells can be injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic Balb c mice to produce ascites containing the anti immunogen monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively the hybridoma cells can be grown in tissue culture flasks or roller bottles. Purification of the monoclonal antibodies produced in the ascites can be accomplished using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography. Alternatively affinity chromatography based upon binding of antibody to protein A or protein G can be employed.

Antibodies directed against the FcRH5 polypeptide disclosed herein can be successfully produced using this technique s . More specifically functional monoclonal antibodies that are capable of recognizing and binding to FcRH5 protein as measured by standard ELISA FACS sorting analysis and or immunohistochemistry analysis can be successfully generated against the following FcRH5 protein as disclosed herein PRO820 DNA56041 PRO52387 DNA257845 .

In addition to the preparation of monoclonal antibodies directed against the FcRH5 polypeptides as described herein many of the monoclonal antibodies can be successfully conjugated to a cell toxin for use in directing the cellular toxin to a cell or tissue that expresses a FcRH5 polypeptide of interested both in vitro and in vivo . For example toxin e.g. DM1 derivitized monoclonal antibodies can be successfully generated to the following FcRH5 polypeptides as described herein PRO820 DNA56041 PRO52387 DNA257845 .

To make cell lines for screening the FcRH5 antibodies SVT2 mouse fibroblast cell lines stably expressing the tagged and untagged FcRH5 IRTA2 were generated. The FcRH5 IRTA2 cDNA was PCR amplified from a spleen cell library and TA cloned Invitrogen into pCR4. To make the untagged expression construct the open reading frames ORFs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV.PD.nbe by using PCR to add restriction sites digestion of the PCR product and ligation into the vector. N terminal tagged expression constructs were made by amplification of the FcRH5 IRTA2 ORFs without the signal sequence and ligation of the PCR product into the pMSCVneo Clontech vector containing the gD tag and signal sequence M G G T A A R L G A V I L F V V I V G H G V R G K Y A L A D A S L K M A D P N R F R G K D L P V L D Q L L SEQ ID NO 1 . For each FcRH5 IRTA2 two stable cell lines were established for use in screening the monoclonal antibodies for FACS specific reactivity and crossreactivity between the FcRH IRTAs. The gD tagged and untagged expression vectors were transfected into SVT2 grown in high glucose DMEM 10 FBS 2 mM L glutamine cells by the standard Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. protocol. The gD tagged transfectants were put under 0.5 mg ml Geneticin Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. selection for one week and then single cell FACS sorted with gD tag specific monoclonal antibody gD 952 Genentech South San Francisco to acquire the highest expressing clone. The untagged transfectants were put under 5.0 ug ml puromycin Calbiochem La Jolla Calif. selection until visible colonies grew out. RNA from each colony was isolated by the standard Trizol Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. protocol and TaqMan ABI Foster City Calif. run to determine the highest producing clone.

Protein for immunization of mice was generated by transient transfection of vectors that expresses the His tagged extra cellular domain ECDs of the FcRH5 IRTA2 into CHO cells. The protein was purified from the transfected cell supernatants on nickel columns and the identity of the protein confirmed by N terminal sequencing.

Ten Balb c mice Charles River Laboratories Hollister Calif. were hyperimmunized with recombinant polyhistidine tagged HIS6 SEQ ID NO 69 protein in Ribi adjuvant Ribi Immunochem Research Inc. Hamilton Mo. . B cells from mice demonstrating high antibody titers against the immunogen by direct ELISA and specific binding to SVT2 mouse fibroblast cells stably expressing the FcRH of interest by FACS were fused with mouse myeloma cells X63.Ag8.653 American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. using a modified protocol analogous to one previously described Kohler and Milstein 1975 Hongo et al. 1995 . After 10 12 days the supernatants were harvested and screened for antibody production and binding by direct ELISA and FACS. Positive clones showing the highest immunobinding after the second round of subcloning by limiting dilution were expanded and cultured for further characterization including FcRH1 2 3 4 and 5 specificity and crossreactivity. The supernatants harvested from each hybridoma lineage were purified by affinity chromatography Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography FPLC Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden using a modified protocol analogous to one previously described Hongo et al. 1995 . The purified antibody preparations were then sterile filtered 0.2 m pore size Nalgene Rochester N.Y. and stored at 4 C. in phosphate buffered saline PBS .

Monoclonal antibodies that are capable of recognizing and binding to FcRH5 protein as measured by standard ELISA FACS sorting analysis and or immunohistochemistry analysis have been successfully generated against the PRO52837 FcRH5c IRTA2c and have been designated as

The FcRH binding affinities of IgGs were calculated from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a Biacore 2000 surface plasmon resonance system BIAcore Inc. . A biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of either anti murine IgG BR 1008 338 using N ethyl N 3 dimethyaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instruction BIAcore Inc. . Briefly for each cycle of kinetic analysis 5 ul of 100 nM IgG was captured on the chip two fold serial dilution of various FcRHs were injected at a flow rate of 20 ul min for 150 sec. Antigen dissociation was monitored for 180 sec before regeneration. Equilibrium dissociation constants at 25 C. were calculated by fitting the data with a 1 1 Langmuir binding model. Running buffer was PBS with 0.05 Tween 20. The results are shown below in Table 9. All the antibodies bound antigen with sufficient affinity to be used as a therapeutic.

For construction of chimeric 7D11 IgG1 total RNA was extracted from 7D11 hybridoma cells using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit Cat 74104 and the manufacturer s suggested protocol. Using the N terminal amino acid sequences obtained for the light and heavy chains of the 7D11 monoclonal antibody PCR primers specific for each chain were designed. Reverse primers for RT PCR were designed to match the framework 4 of the gene family corresponding to the N terminal sequence. Primers were also designed to add desired restriction sites for cloning. For the light chain these were EcoRV at the N terminus and KpnI at 3 end of Framework 4. For the heavy chain sites added were BsiWI at the N terminus and ApaI slightly downstream of the VH CH1 junction. Primer sequences are as follows 

RT PCR reactions for light and heavy chains were carried out using a Qiagen One step RT PCR kit Cat 210210 and the suggested reaction mixes and conditions. pRK vectors for mammalian cell expression of IgGs have been previously described Gorman et al. DNA Prot Eng Tech 2 3 10 1990 . Vectors have been modified and have incorporated certain endonuclease restriction enzyme recognition sites to facilitate cloning and expression Shields et al. 2000 276 6591 6604 . Amplified VL was cloned into a pRK mammalian cell expression vector pRK.LPG3.HumanKappa containing the human kappa constant domain. Amplified V11 was inserted to a pRK mammalian cell expression vector pRK.LPG4.HumanHC encoding the full length human IgG1 constant domain.

The DNA sequence was obtained for the entire coding region of the resultant murine human chimeric light and heavy chains for anti human FcRH5 ch7D11 . The encoded polypeptide for the murine human chimeric light and heavy chains encoded by the DNAs are shown in respectively. After DNA sequencing the expression of the plasmids were analyzed.

The plasmids were transiently transfected in 293 an adenovirus transformed human embryonic kidney cell line Graham et al. 36 59 74 1977 . Specifically 293 cells were split on the day prior to transfection and plated in serum containing medium. On the following day double stranded DNA prepared as a calcium phosphate precipitate was added followed by pAdVAntage DNA Promega Madison Wis. and cells were incubated overnight at 37 C. Cells were cultured in serum free medium and harvested after 4 days. The antibody proteins were purified from the transfected cell supernatants on proteinA columns and then buffer exchanged into 10 mM sodium succinate 140 mM NaCl pH 6.0 and concentrated using a Centricon 10 Amicon . The identity of the proteins confirmed by N terminal sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The antibodies were tested for binding to human FcRH5 by FACS in SVT2 cells as described below.

Antibody 10A8 was derived as members of a panel of anti human FcRH5 hybridomas. Mouse human chimeras of these antibodies were constructed using RT PCR to amplify the variable domains of hybridoma light and heavy chains using total mRNA as substrate. Light chain variable domains were cloned into vector pRK.LPG3.HumanKappa containing the human constant kappa domain while the heavy chain variable domains were cloned into vector pRK.LPG4.HumanHC encoding the full length human IgG1 constant domains. DNA sequencing allowed identification of framework and CDR regions of the variable domains. Chimeric and humanized versions of 10A8 are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61 211 695 filed Apr. 1 2009 61 166 217 filed Apr. 2 2009 and 61 266 972 filed Dec. 4 2009 which are each incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

Antibody 13G9 was derived as members of a panel of anti human FcRH5 hybridomas. Mouse human chimeras of these antibodies were constructed using RT PCR as described above to amplify the variable domains of hybridoma light and heavy chains using total mRNA as substrate. Light chain variable domains were cloned into vector pRK.LPG3.HumanKappa containing the human constant kappa domain while the heavy chain variable domains were cloned into vector pRK.LPG4.HumanHC encoding the full length human IgG1 constant domains. The DNA sequence was obtained for the entire coding region of the resultant murine human chimeric light and heavy chains for anti human FcRH5 ch13G9 which allowed for identification of framework and CDR regions of the variable domains. The encoded polypeptide for the 13G9 murine human chimeric light and heavy chains encoded by the DNAs are shown in respectively.

Residue numbers are according to Kabat Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Single letter amino acid abbreviations are used. DNA degeneracies are represented using the IUB code N A C G T D A G T V A C G B C G T H A C T K G T M A C R A G S G C W A T Y C T .

Various humanized anti FcRH5 antibodies were generated. The VL and VH domains from murine FcRH5 antibody 13G9 were aligned with the human consensus VL kappa I huKI and human subgroup III consensus VH huIII domains. Alignment of the light chain variable domain of murine 13G9 mu13G9 with the human consensus sequence kappa I is shown in . The CDRs of 13G9 were engineered onto a mammalian expression vector containing a mammalian signal sequence the consensus sequence for the human V Kappa I variable domain and a human constant kappa I domain. The CDRs were transferred using single oligonucleotides encoding each CDR and ssDNA of the acceptor plasmid following the Kunkle mutagenesis protocol. One murine residue alanine 46 a Vernier residue in Framework 2 was also transferred from the donor mAb to the acceptor plasmid. Residues grafted and the resultant human 13G9 version one light chain variable domain are shown in .

Likewise the CDRs of the heavy chain variable domain of murine 13G9 were engineered onto a vector containing the mammalian signal sequence the consensus sequence of human heavy subgroup III and sequences encoding the full length human IgG1 constant domains. Because there were differences noted in the murine vs human residues at several Vernier residues known to influence conformation of the CDRs murine framework residues at positions 6 69 71 73 76 and 78 were also transferred from the donor to the acceptor plasmid. Alignments of the murine 13G9 heavy variable domain the human subgroup III variable domain and the resulting human 13G9 version 1 hu13G9.v1 heavy chain variable domain are shown in .

The chimera and version 1 of 13G9 were expressed in 293 cells and purified as described above. Binding of resultant proteins was analyzed by FACS and Scatchard analysis see below . Binding of version 1 of 13G9 hu13G9.v1 to cells expressing FcRH5 was essentially equivalent to the chimera therefore version 1 was carried forward for conjugation studies.

It was noted that expression of humanized 13G9 was relatively low. Comparison of the framework sequences of murine 13G9 to several human subgroup consensus sequences showed that 13G9 more closely resembled human subgroups VII and I than subgroup III. This suggested that even though high affinity binding to FcRH5 when the CDRs of 13G9 were humanized to the framework of subgroup III perhaps protein folding was not optimal. Therefore framework changes were made to 13G9 version 1 to increase homology to subgroup VII in order to improve expression. Alignments of the variable domains of the heavy chains of version 1 version 3 and version 8 are shown in . Substitutions made are as follows for version 3 hu13G9.v3 V12K V13K V78A in the framework. In CDR H1 the substitution M34I was also made to improve packing. For version 8 hu13G9.v8 substitutions were L11V V12K V13K L18V R19K L20V K75V V78A N82I N82aS R83K and M34I.

The plasmids were transiently transfected in 293 an adenovirus transformed human embryonic kidney cell line Graham et al. 36 59 74 1977 . Specifically 293 cells were split on the day prior to transfection and plated in serum containing medium. On the following day double stranded DNA prepared as a calcium phosphate precipitate was added followed by pAdVAntage DNA Promega Madison Wis. and cells were incubated overnight at 37 C. Cells were cultured in serum free medium and harvested after 4 days. The antibody proteins were purified from the transfected cell supernatants on proteinA columns and then buffer exchanged into 10 mM sodium succinate 140 mM NaCl pH 6.0 and concentrated using a Centricon 10 Amicon . The identity of the proteins confirmed by N terminal sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The antibodies were tested for binding to human FcRH5 by FACS in SVT2 cells as described below.

To determine the cross reactivity of FcRH5 antibodies binding of IgG variants to SVT2 cells expressing human FcRH1 6 were analyzed using FACS analysis.

Briefly approximately 10cells of SVT2 cells stably expressing gD tagged huFcRH1 6 in 100 l were incubated with 1.0 ug of murine or chimeric Ab Mu anti gD positive control Mu anti FcRH5 1H4 mu1H4 Mu anti FcRH5 4D10 mu4D10 Mu anti FcRH5 6H1 mu6H1 Mu anti FcRH5 7D11 mu7D11 Ch anti FcRH5 7D11 ch7D11 Mu anti FcRH5 8H6 mu8H6 Mu anti FcRH5 9E2 mu9E2 or Mu anti FcRH5 13G9 mu13G9 . Incubation of SVT2 cells stably expressing the empty vector was incubated with the same antibodies and used as a negative control. PE conjugated Rat anti MuIgG Rat anti MuIgG or Mu anti HuIgG was used as the secondary detection antibody. Results are shown in . All tested antibodies specifically bind FcRH5 expect for mu6H1 which cross reacts to FcRH1. mu8H6 is a weak but FcRH5 specific antibody by FACS analysis.

To further determine binding of the mouse FcRH5 antibodies binding of IgG variants to Raji cells expressing human FcRH5 and 293T cells expressing cynomologous FcRH5 were analyzed using FACS analysis.

Briefly approximately 10Raji cells stably transfected with human FcRH5 and 293T cells transiently transfected with gD tagged cyno FcRH5 were incubated 1.0 g biotinylated mouse isotype control biotinylated mu anti gD biotinylated mu6H1 biotinylated mu13G9 or biotinylated mu7D11 in 1000 FACS buffer PBS 0.5 BSA 0.05 Sodium Azide . PE conjugated Streptavidin was used as the secondary detection reagent. The results are shown in .

For additional FACS analysis of FcRH5 antibodies 1.0 g 0.1 g or 0.01 g of antibody was titrated per million cells of BJAB cells stably expressing huFcRH5 and SVT2 cells stably expressing cynoFcRH5. Briefly approximately 10cells in 100 l were incubated with varying amounts 1.0 ug 01. ug or 0.01 ug of murine Ab mu1H4 mu4D10 mu6H1 mu7D11 mu9E2 mu10A8 mu140F5 or mu13G9 per million cells of BJAB cells stably expressing huFcRH5 and SVT2 cells stably expressing cynoFcRH5. Incubation with 1.0 ug 10cells of the appropriate Mu IgG isotype control was used as a negative control. PE conjugated Rat anti MuIgGor Rat anti MuIgGwas used as the secondary detection antibody. Results are shown in . Mu anti FcRH5 1H4 Mu anti FcRH5 6H1 Mu anti FcRH5 7D11 Ms anti FcRH5 10A8 Mu anti FcRH5 10F5 or Mu anti FcRH5 13G9 cross react with cynomolgus FcRH5 by FACS analysis and they can be used in preclinical safety studies assessing target dependent toxicity.

To further determine binding of the FcRH5 murine antibodies and IgG clones binding of iodinated IgG variants to OPM2 cells expressing human FcRH5 and SVT2 cells expressing cynomologous FcRH5 Scatchard analysis was performed Table 9A .

For Scatchard analysis 0.5 nM Ilabeled murine or IgG clone anti FcRH5 was competed against unlabeled murine or IgG clone anti FcRH5 respectively ranging from 50 to 0.02 nM 12 step 1 2 serial dilution in the presence of a transfected OPM2 line stably expressing human FcRH5 and a transfected SVT2 line stably expressing cynomologous FcRH5. After a four hour incubation at 4 C. cells were washed and cell pellet counts were read by a gamma counter 1470 WIZARD Automatic Gamma Counter Perkin Elmer Walthem Mass. . All points were done in triplicate and counted for 10 minutes. The average CPM was used for Kd calculation using the New Ligand Genentech South San Francisco Calif. program. Results are shown in Table 9A.

The drugs used for generation of antibody drug conjugates ADCs for anti human FcRH5 included maytansinoid DM1 and DM4 and dolastatin 10 derivatives monomethylauristatin E MMAE and monomethylauristatin F MMAF . See US20050276812 filed May 31 2005 and US20050238649 filed Nov. 5 2004 both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety . MMAF unlike MMAE DM1 and DM4 is relative membrane impermeable at neutral pH so has relatively low activity as a free drug although it is very potent once in the cell. Doronina et al. 17 114 123 2006 . DM1 DM4 MMAE and MMAF are mitotic inhibitors that are at least 100 fold more cytotoxic than the vinca alkaloid mitotic inhibitors used in chemotherapeutic treatments of NHLs Doronina et al. 17 114 123 2006 Doronina et al. 21 778 784 2003 Erickson et al. 66 4426 4433 2006 . The linkers used for generation of the ADCs were SMCC for DM1 SPDB for DM4 and MC or MC vc PAB for MMAE and MMAF. For DM1 and DM4 the antibodies were linked to DM1 and DM4 through the amino group of lysine using the stable thioester linker SMCC designated MCC after conjugation . Alternatively for DM4 the antibodies were linked to DM4 through the e amino group of lysine using the SPDB linker. DM1 attached via the SMCC linker is resistant to cleavage in reducing conditions. Further SMCC DM1 and SPDB DM4 ADCs induce cell toxicity if the ADC is internalized and targeted to the lysosome causing the release of lysine N DM1 which is an effective anti mitotic agent inside the cell and when released from the cell lysine N DM1 is non toxic Erickson et al. Cancer Res. 66 4426 4433 2006 For MMAE and MMAF the antibodies were linked to MMAE or MMAF through the cysteine by maleeimidocaproyl valine citruline vc p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl MC vc PAB . For MMAF the antibodies were alternatively linked to MMAF through the cysteine by maleeimidocaproyl MC linker.

Antibody drug conjugates ADCs for anti human FcRH5 using SMCC DM1 were generated similar to the procedure described in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 141 344 filed May 31 2005 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Anti human FcRH5 purified antibodies were buffer exchanged into a solution containing 50 mM potassium phosphate and 2 mM EDTA pH 7.0. SMCC Pierce Biotechnology Rockford Ill. was dissolved in dimethylacetamide DMA and added to the antibody solution to make a final SMCC Ab molar ratio of 10 1. The reaction was allowed to proceed for three hours at room temperature with mixing. The SMCC modified antibody was subsequently purified on a GE Healthcare HiTrap desalting column G 25 equilibrated in 35 mM sodium citrate with 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA pH 6.0. DM1 dissolved in DMA was added to the SMCC antibody preparation to give a molar ratio of DM1 to antibody of 10 1. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 20 hrs at room temperature with mixing. The DM1 modified antibody solution was diafiltered with 20 volumes of PBS to remove unreacted DM1 sterile filtered and stored at 4 degrees C. Typically a 40 60 yield of antibody was achieved through this process. The preparation was usually 95 monomeric as assessed by gel filtration and laser light scattering. Since DM1 has an absorption maximum at 252 nm the amount of drug bound to the antibody could be determined by differential absorption measurements at 252 and 280 nm. Typically the drug to antibody ratio was 3 to 4.

To generate anti human FcRH5 SPDB DM4 antibody drug conjugate with of 3 4 drugs Ab the antibody was first modified with SPDB 4 2 Pyridyldithio butyric acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester to generate dithiopyridyl groups. A 4 6 fold molar excess of SPDB to antibody is added and allowed to react for 90 min at RT. The reaction is carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7 with 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA at an antibody concentration of 5 10 mgs ml. Following the SPDB reaction ethanol is added to a final concentration of 5 V V and the thiol containing DM4 drug is added at a 1.7 fold molar excess over SPDB. Incubation is carried out at room temperature for 16 hrs. The conjugate is purified by diafiltration gel filtration or cation exchange chromatography.

Antibody drug conjugates ADC for anti human FcRH5 using MC val cit vc PAB MMAE drug linker were generated similar to the procedure described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Purified anti human FcRH5 antibody was dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at pH 8.0 and further treated with an excess of 100 mM dithiothreitol DTT . After incubation at 37 degrees C. for about 30 minutes the buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol Ab value was checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm. The reduced antibody dissolved in PBS was chilled on ice. The drug linker MC val cit vc PAB MMAE in DMSO was dissolved in acetonitrile and water and added to the chilled reduced antibody in PBS. After an hour incubation an excess of maleimide was added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the antibody drug conjugate was purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions and frozen for storage.

This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al. J. Immunol. Metho. 160 81 88 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay was conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al. AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404 1995 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent The CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as RLU measured over time. RLU is normalized RLU percentage compared to a non drug conjugate control. Alternatively photons from luminescence can be counted in a scintillation counter in the presence of a scintillant. The light units can be represented then as CPS counts per second .

The construction of an FcRH5 bispecific antibody specifically an anti CD3 FcRH5 protruberance into cavity bispecific antibody is described below.

Various protruberance into cavity bispecific antibodies have been described previously. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 731 168 and 7 183 076 Ridgway et al. Prot. Eng. 9 617 621 1996 Atwell et al. J. Mol. Biol. 270 26 35 1997 Merchant et al. Nat. Biotechn. 16 677 681 1998 . In certain instances the C3 interface between the humanized anti CD3 CD4 IgG chimera previously described by Chamow et al. 153 4268 1994 was engineered to maximize the percentage of heteromultimers that could be recovered from mammalian cell lines cotransfected with expression constructs. As used herein heteromultimers refers to a molecule e.g. a bispecific antibody comprising a least a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide wherein the second polypeptide differs in amino acid sequence from the first polypeptide by at least one amino acid residue.

As described in the documents cited in the preceding paragraph the strategy used to drive heteromultimer formation relied on introducing one or more protruberance mutations into a first polypeptide e.g. the C3 domain of one antibody H chain and also introducing one or more corresponding cavity mutations into a second polypeptide e.g. the C3 domain of a second antibody H chain. A protuberance mutation replaced a small amino acid with a larger one and a cavity mutation replaced a large amino acid with a smaller one. Furthermore in addition to the protruberance and cavity mutations free thiol containing residues were introduced at the interface of two polypeptides e.g. two C3 domains which were shown to enhance formation of heteromultimers. Various exemplary protruberance into cavity mutations and free thiol containing residues introduced at polypeptide interfaces have been described. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 731 168 and 7 183 076 Ridgway et al. Prot. Eng. 9 617 621 1996 Atwell et al. J. Mol. Biol. 270 26 35 1997 Merchant et al. Nat. Biotechn. 16 677 681 1998 .

Bio Tehcnology 10 163 167 1992 . A mutation introducing either a protruberance or a cavity into the C3 domain as described above of the humanized anti CD3 H chain is made for example by site directed mutagenesis. Various site directed mutagenesis methods are well known in the art. See e.g. Kunkel et al. Methods Enzymol. 154 367 382 1987 . In addition expression plasmids encoding humanized anti FcRH5 light and heavy chains such humanized anti FcRH5 light and heavy chains as described herein are constructed. A mutation introducing either a corresponding cavity if the anti CD3 C3 domain has a protruberance mutation or a corresponding protruberance if the anti CD3 C3 domain has a cavity mutation in the C3 domain as described above of the humanized anti FcRH5 H chain is made for example by site directed mutagenesis. Bispecific anti CD3 FcRH5 antibodies are produced by transforming the expression plasmids described above into an appropriate strain e.g. 33B6 using methods well known in the art. See e.g. Rodrigues et al. Cancer Res. 55 63 70 1995 . Antibody is secreted by the transformed grown in a 10 L fermentor as described previously. Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . The antibodies are purified and analyzed using procedures known in the art. See e.g. Atwell et al. J. Mol. Biol. 270 26 35 1997 .

To assess the ability of anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibodies to bind B cells and T cells human peripheral white blood cells are isolated from whole blood from healthy donors using a Ficoll gradient according to standard procedures known in the art. About 1 million cells are incubated with anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody on ice in buffer containing 0.5 BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS. The cells are then washed and stained with FITC conjugated goat Fab anti human IgG together with anti CD8 APC and anti CD138 PE and anti CD38 PerCP Cy5 antibodies following the manufacturer s protocol BD Biosciences San Diego Calif. . Binding activities are assessed with a FACS based assay using FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer BD Biosciences San Diego Calif. and analysis is carried out using Flowjo software Tree Star Ashland Oreg. .

EJM FcRH5.LSP.2 multiple myeloma cells EJM cells DSMZ ACC 560 stably transfected with human FcRH5 are used as target cells and are co cultured with total human peripheral white blood cells or CD8 T cells. If CD8 T cells are used they are purified from human PBMC by negative sorting using a CD8 T cell isolation kit Miltenyi Biotech Auburn Calif. in 96 well round bottom plates. 20 000 EJM FcRH5.LSP.2 cells are added per well with a ratio of target effector cells 1 10 with or without anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody. After approximately 19 hours cells are stained with labeled anti CD38 FITC and anti CD138 PE following the manufacturer s protocol BD Biosciences San Diego Calif. and mixed with Fluoresbrite Calibration Grade 6.0 Micron YG Microspheres Polysciences Inc. Warrington Pa. . FACS analysis is carried out by gating forward sideward scatters and CD38 CD138 staining. Dead cells are excluded using propidium iodide staining according to standard procedures. Specific killing activity of the anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody is calculated according to the following equation specific killing 1 number of live EJM FCRH5.LSP.2 cells with treatment number of live EJM FCRH5.LSP.2 cells in effector EJM FCRH5.LSP.2 without anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody 100.

EJM FcRH5.LSP.2 multiple myeloma cells are mixed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and injected subcutaneously into the right thoracic flank of female NOD.CD17 Prkdc J mice Charles Rivers Laboratories Wilmington Mass. . The inoculated mice are then randomly separated into control and treatment groups. Control groups are administered vehicle or anti CD3 Her2 control bispecific antibody. Treatment groups are administered anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody. Bispecific antibodies are administered over a range of 0.01 to 10 mg kg. Control or treatment is administered intravenously within 1 2 hours post cell inoculation and repeated daily for 5 consecutive days. Tumors are measured in two dimensions length and width using calipers twice at week. Mice are clinically monitored twice a week. At the end of the experiment tumor size in the control treated animals is compared to tumor size in the anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody treated animals to assess the efficacy of the anti CD3 FcRH5 bispecific antibody treatment.

To test the efficacy of hu13G9 drug conjugates with MC vc PAB MMAE at different dosages the effects of the conjugated antibody on tumors in mice are analyzed.

Specifically the ability of the antibodies to regress tumors in EJM cells Multiple myeloma cell line stably transfected with human FcRH5 are examined.

EJM ACC 560 cells are a commercially available human multiple myeloma cell line obtained from DSMZ Germany . As EJM cells do not endogenously express FcRH5 the EJM cells were stably transfected with human FcRH5 resulting in the EJM.CMV.PD.FcRH5.LSP.2 cell line.
