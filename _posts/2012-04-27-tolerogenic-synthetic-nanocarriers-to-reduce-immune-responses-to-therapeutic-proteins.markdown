This invention relates to synthetic nanocarrier compositions with therapeutic protein antigen presenting cell APC presentable antigens and immunosuppressants and related methods. The compositions and methods allow for efficient uptake by APCs to shift the immune response in favor of tolerogenic immune response development specific to therapeutic proteins. The compositions and methods provided can therefore be used to generate a tolerogenic immune response in a subject in which the administration of a therapeutic protein is or is expected to result in undesired immune responses.

Therapeutic treatments such as protein or enzyme replacement therapies often result in undesired immune responses to the particular therapeutic. In such cases cells of the immune system recognize the therapeutic as foreign and attempt to destroy it just as they attempt to destroy infecting organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Such undesired immune responses may be reduced through the use of immunosuppressant drugs. Conventional immunosuppressant drugs however are broad acting. Additionally in order to maintain immunosuppression immunosuppressant drug therapy is generally a life long proposition. Unfortunately the use of broad acting immunosuppressants are associated with a risk of severe side effects such as tumors infections nephrotoxicity and metabolic disorders. Accordingly new immunosuppressant therapies would be beneficial.

As previously mentioned current conventional immunosuppressants are broad acting and generally result in an overall systemic downregulation of the immune system. The compositions and methods provided herein allow for more targeted immune effects by for example allowing for the targeted delivery to immune cells of interest. Thus the compositions and methods can achieve immune suppression in a more directed manner. It has been found that delivering immunosuppressants and antigens comprising MHC Class II restricted epitopes can effectively reduce the production of antigen specific antibodies as well as reduce the generation of antigen specific CD4 T cells and B cells. As such immune responses can be beneficial in countering undesired immune responses that are generated during therapeutic treatment with therapeutic proteins the invention is useful for promoting tolerogenic immune responses in subjects who have received are receiving or will receive a therapeutic protein against which undesired immune responses are generated or are expected to be generated. The present invention in some embodiments prevents or suppresses undesired immune responses that may neutralize the beneficial effect of certain therapeutic treatments.

The inventors have unexpectedly and surprisingly discovered that the problems and limitations noted above can be overcome by practicing the invention disclosed herein. In particular the inventors have unexpectedly discovered that it is possible to provide synthetic nanocarrier compositions and related methods that induce a tolerogenic immune response to therapeutic proteins. The compositions described herein include compositions that comprise i a first population of synthetic nanocarriers that are coupled to immunosuppressants and ii a second population of synthetic nanocarriers that are coupled to therapeutic protein APC presentable antigens.

In another aspect dosage forms of any of the compositions herein are provided. Such dosage forms can be administered to a subject such as a subject in need thereof e.g. in need of therapeutic protein specific tolerogenic immune responses . In one embodiment the subject is one who has been is being or will be treated with a therapeutic protein against which undesired immune responses are generated or are expected to be generated.

In another aspect any of the compositions provided herein is administered to a subject. The composition may be administered in an amount effective to reduce the generation of an undesired immune response against one or more therapeutic proteins. In one embodiment a composition is administered to a subject according to a protocol that was previously shown to reduce the generation of an undesired immune response to therapeutic proteins in one or more subjects. The undesired immune response may be the generation of therapeutic protein specific antibodies CD4 T cell proliferation and or activity or B cell proliferation and or activity or combinations thereof. The undesired immune responses may also be the generation of other immune responses downstream from the foregoing. In embodiments the amounts effective or protocol generates or has been shown to generate desired immune responses. Such immune responses include the reduction of any of or combinations of the foregoing. Such immune responses include any tolerogenic immune responses such as those described herein.

The compositions may be administered to a subject prior to concomitantly with or after the administration of a therapeutic protein to the subject. In some embodiments the synthetic nanocarriers compositions are administered prior to the establishment of a mature memory response in the subject. The methods provided in some embodiments may further comprise administering the therapeutic protein. In embodiments the compositions provided may also be administered as one or more maintenance doses to a subject that has received is receiving or will receive a therapeutic protein. In such embodiments the compositions provided are administered such that the generation of an undesired immune response is reduced for a certain length of time. Examples of such lengths of time are provided elsewhere herein.

In yet another aspect a method of i producing a first population of synthetic nanocarriers that are coupled to immunosuppressants and ii producing a second population of synthetic nanocarriers that are coupled to therapeutic protein APC presentable antigens is provided. In one embodiment the method further comprises producing a dosage form comprising the first and second populations of synthetic nanocarriers.

 Administering or administration means providing a material to a subject in a manner that is pharmacologically useful.

 Amount effective in the context of a composition or dosage form for administration to a subject refers to an amount of the composition or dosage form that produces one or more desired immune responses in the subject for example the generation of a tolerogenic immune response e.g. a reduction in the proliferation activation induction recruitment of antigen specific CD4 T cells or antigen specific B cells or a reduction in the production of antigen specific antibodies . Therefore in some embodiments an amount effective is any amount of a composition provided herein that produces one or more of these desired immune responses. This amount can be for in vitro or in vivo purposes. For in vivo purposes the amount can be one that a clinician would believe may have a clinical benefit for a subject in need of antigen specific tolerization.

Amounts effective can involve only reducing the level of an undesired immune response although in some embodiments it involves preventing an undesired immune response altogether. Amounts effective can also involve delaying the occurrence of an undesired immune response. An amount that is effective can also be an amount of a composition provided herein that produces a desired therapeutic endpoint or a desired therapeutic result. Amounts effective preferably result in a tolerogenic immune response in a subject to an antigen. The achievement of any of the foregoing can be monitored by routine methods.

In some embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the amount effective is one in which the desired immune response persists in the subject for at least 1 week at least 2 weeks at least 1 month at least 2 months at least 3 months at least 4 months at least 5 months at least 6 months at least 9 months at least 1 year at least 2 years at least 5 years or longer. In other embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the amount effective is one which produces a measurable desired immune response for example a measurable decrease in an immune response e.g. to a specific antigen for at least 1 week at least 2 weeks at least 1 month at least 2 months at least 3 months at least 4 months at least 5 months at least 6 months at least 9 months at least 1 year at least 2 years at least 5 years or longer.

Amounts effective will depend of course on the particular subject being treated the severity of a condition disease or disorder the individual patient parameters including age physical condition size and weight the duration of the treatment the nature of concurrent therapy if any the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose be used that is the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art however that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason.

In general doses of the immunosuppressants and or antigens in the compositions of the invention can range from about 10 g kg to about 100 000 g kg. In some embodiments the doses can range from about 0.1 mg kg to about 100 mg kg. In still other embodiments the doses can range from about 0.1 mg kg to about 25 mg kg about 25 mg kg to about 50 mg kg about 50 mg kg to about 75 mg kg or about 75 mg kg to about 100 mg kg. Alternatively the dose can be administered based on the number of synthetic nanocarriers that provide the desired amount of immunosuppressants and or antigens. For example useful doses include greater than 10 10 10 10or 10synthetic nanocarriers per dose. Other examples of useful doses include from about 1 10to about 1 10 about 1 10to about 1 10or about 1 10to about 1 10synthetic nanocarriers per dose.

 Antigen means a B cell antigen or T cell antigen. Type s of antigens means molecules that share the same or substantially the same antigenic characteristics. In some embodiments antigens may be proteins polypeptides peptides lipoproteins glycolipids polynucleotides polysaccharides or are contained or expressed in cells. In some embodiments such as when the antigens are not well defined or characterized the antigens may be contained within a cell or tissue preparation cell debris cell exosomes conditioned media etc. An antigen can be combined with the synthetic nanocarriers in the same form as what a subject is exposed to that causes an undesired immune response but may also be a fragment or derivative thereof. When a fragment or derivative however a desired immune response to the form encountered by such a subject is the preferable result with the compositions and methods provided.

 Antigen specific refers to any immune response that results from the presence of the antigen or portion thereof or that generates molecules that specifically recognize or bind the antigen. For example where the immune response is antigen specific antibody production antibodies are produced that specifically bind the antigen. As another example where the immune response is antigen specific B cell or CD4 T cell proliferation and or activity the proliferation and or activity results from recognition of the antigen or portion thereof alone or in complex with MHC molecules B cells etc.

 Assessing an immune response refers to any measurement or determination of the level presence or absence reduction increase in etc. of an immune response in vitro or in vivo. Such measurements or determinations may be performed on one or more samples obtained from a subject. Such assessing can be performed with any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art.

 Epitope also known as an antigenic determinant is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system specifically by for example antibodies B cells or T cells. As used herein MHC Class I restricted epitopes are epitopes that are presented to immune cells by MHC class 1 molecules found on nucleated cells. MHC Class II restricted epitopes are epitopes that are presented to immune cells by MHC class II molecules found on antigen presenting cells APCs for example on professional antigen presenting immune cells such as on macrophages B cells and dendritic cells or on non hematopoietic cells such as hepatocytes. B cell epitopes are molecular structures that are recognized by antibodies or B cells. In some embodiments the epitope itself is an antigen.

 Generating means causing an action such as an immune response e.g. a tolerogenic immune response to occur either directly oneself or indirectly such as but not limited to an unrelated third party that takes an action through reliance on one s words or deeds.

 Identifying is any action or set of actions that allows a clinician to recognize a subject as one who may benefit from the methods and compositions provided herein. Preferably the identified subject is one who is in need of a tolerogenic immune response as provided herein. The action or set of actions may be either directly oneself or indirectly such as but not limited to an unrelated third party that takes an action through reliance on one s words or deeds.

 Immunosuppressant means a compound that causes an APC to have an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect . An immunosuppressive effect generally refers to the production or expression of cytokines or other factors by the APC that reduces inhibits or prevents an undesired immune response or that promotes a desired immune response. When the APC results in an immunosuppressive effect on immune cells that recognize an antigen presented by the APC the immunosuppressive effect is said to be specific to the presented antigen. Such effect is also referred to herein as a tolerogenic effect. Without being bound by any particular theory it is thought that the immunosuppressive or tolerogenic effect is a result of the immunosuppressant being delivered to the APC preferably in the presence of an antigen e.g. an administered antigen or one that is already present in vivo . Accordingly the immunosuppressant includes compounds that provide a tolerogenic immune response to an antigen that may or may not be provided in the same composition or a different composition. In one embodiment the immunosuppressant is one that causes an APC to promote a regulatory phenotype in one or more immune effector cells. For example the regulatory phenotype may be characterized by the inhibition of the production induction stimulation or recruitment of antigen specific CD4 T cells or B cells the inhibition of the production of antigen specific antibodies the production induction stimulation or recruitment of Treg cells e.g. CD4 CD25highFoxP3 Treg cells etc. This may be the result of the conversion of CD4 T cells or B cells to a regulatory phenotype. This may also be the result of induction of FoxP3 in other immune cells such as CD8 T cells macrophages and iNKT cells. In one embodiment the immunosuppressant is one that affects the response of the APC after it processes an antigen. In another embodiment the immunosuppressant is not one that interferes with the processing of the antigen. In a further embodiment the immunosuppressant is not an apoptotic signaling molecule. In another embodiment the immunosuppressant is not a phospholipid.

Immunosuppressants include but are not limited to statins mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin or a rapamycin analog TGF signaling agents TGF receptor agonists histone deacetylase inhibitors such as Trichostatin A corticosteroids inhibitors of mitochondrial function such as rotenone P38 inhibitors NF inhibitors such as 6Bio Dexamethasone TCPA 1 IKK VII adenosine receptor agonists prostaglandin E2 agonists PGE2 such as Misoprostol phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor PDE4 such as Rolipram proteasome inhibitors kinase inhibitors G protein coupled receptor agonists G protein coupled receptor antagonists glucocorticoids retinoids cytokine inhibitors cytokine receptor inhibitors cytokine receptor activators peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonists peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonists histone deacetylase inhibitors calcineurin inhibitors phosphatase inhibitors PI3 KB inhibitors such as TGX 221 autophagy inhibitors such as 3 Methyladenine aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors proteasome inhibitor I PSI and oxidized ATPs such as P2X receptor blockers. Immunosuppressants also include IDO vitamin D3 cyclosporins such as cyclosporine A aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors resveratrol azathiopurine Aza 6 mercaptopurine 6 MP 6 thioguanine 6 TG FK506 sanglifehrin A salmeterol mycophenolate mofetil MMF aspirin and other COX inhibitors niflumic acid estriol and triptolide. In embodiments the immunosuppressant may comprise any of the agents provided herein.

The immunosuppressant can be a compound that directly provides the immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect on APCs or it can be a compound that provides the immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect indirectly i.e. after being processed in some way after administration . Immunosuppressants therefore include prodrug forms of any of the compounds provided herein.

Immunosuppressants also include nucleic acids that encode the peptides polypeptides or proteins provided herein that result in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic immune response. In embodiments therefore the immunosuppressant is a nucleic acid that encodes a peptide polypeptide or protein that results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic immune response and it is the nucleic acid that is coupled to the synthetic nanocarrier.

The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA such as mRNA. In embodiments the inventive compositions comprise a complement such as a full length complement or a degenerate due to degeneracy of the genetic code of any of the nucleic acids provided herein. In embodiments the nucleic acid is an expression vector that can be transcribed when transfected into a cell line. In embodiments the expression vector may comprise a plasmid retrovirus or an adenovirus amongst others. Nucleic acids can be isolated or synthesized using standard molecular biology approaches for example by using a polymerase chain reaction to produce a nucleic acid fragment which is then purified and cloned into an expression vector. Additional techniques useful in the practice of this invention may be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 2007 by John Wiley and Sons Inc. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Third Edition Joseph Sambrook Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute Melbourne Australia David Russell University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas Cold Spring Harbor.

In embodiments the immunosuppressants provided herein are coupled to synthetic nanocarriers. In preferable embodiments the immunosuppressant is an element that is in addition to the material that makes up the structure of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example in one embodiment where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more polymers the immunosuppressant is a compound that is in addition and coupled to the one or more polymers. As another example in one embodiment where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more lipids the immunosuppressant is again in addition and coupled to the one or more lipids. In embodiments such as where the material of the synthetic nanocarrier also results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect the immunosuppressant is an element present in addition to the material of the synthetic nanocarrier that results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect.

Other exemplary immunosuppressants include but are not limited small molecule drugs natural products antibodies e.g. antibodies against CD20 CD3 CD4 biologics based drugs carbohydrate based drugs nanoparticles liposomes RNAi antisense nucleic acids aptamers methotrexate NSAIDs fingolimod natalizumab alemtuzumab anti CD3 tacrolimus FK506 etc. Further immunosuppressants are known to those of skill in the art and the invention is not limited in this respect.

 Load of the immunosuppressant or therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen is the amount of the immunosuppressant or therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen coupled to a synthetic nanocarrier based on the total weight of materials in an entire synthetic nanocarrier weight weight . Generally the load is calculated as an average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers. In one embodiment the load of the immunosuppressant on average across the first population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.0001 and 50 . In another embodiment the load of the therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen on average across the first and or second population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.0001 and 50 .

In some embodiments of the above embodiments the load of the immunosuppressant and or the therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen is no more than 25 on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments the load is calculated as described in the Examples.

In embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the load is calculated as follows Approximately 3 mg of synthetic nanocarriers are collected and centrifuged to separate supernatant from synthetic nanocarrier pellet. Acetonitrile is added to the pellet and the sample is sonicated and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. The supernatant and pellet are injected on RP HPLC and absorbance is read at 278 nm. The g found in the pellet is used to calculate entrapped load g in supernatant and pellet are used to calculate total g recovered.

 Maintenance dose refers to a dose that is administered to a subject after an initial dose has resulted in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic response in a subject to sustain a desired immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic response. A maintenance dose for example can be one that maintains the tolerogenic effect achieved after the initial dose prevents an undesired immune response in the subject or prevents the subject becoming a subject at risk of experiencing an undesired immune response including an undesired level of an immune response. In some embodiments the maintenance dose is one that is sufficient to sustain an appropriate level of a desired immune response.

 Maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier means the largest dimension of a nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. Minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier means the smallest dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example for a spheroidal synthetic nanocarrier the maximum and minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be substantially identical and would be the size of its diameter. Similarly for a cuboidal synthetic nanocarrier the minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the smallest of its height width or length while the maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the largest of its height width or length. In an embodiment a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or greater than 100 nm. In an embodiment a maximum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or less than 5 m. Preferably a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is greater than 110 nm more preferably greater than 120 nm more preferably greater than 130 nm and more preferably still greater than 150 nm. Aspects ratios of the maximum and minimum dimensions of inventive synthetic nanocarriers may vary depending on the embodiment. For instance aspect ratios of the maximum to minimum dimensions of the synthetic nanocarriers may vary from 1 1 to 1 000 000 1 preferably from 1 1 to 100 000 1 more preferably from 1 1 to 10 000 1 more preferably from 1 1 to 1000 1 still more preferably from 1 1 to 100 1 and yet more preferably from 1 1 to 10 1. Preferably a maximum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or less than 3 m more preferably equal to or less than 2 m more preferably equal to or less than 1 m more preferably equal to or less than 800 nm more preferably equal to or less than 600 nm and more preferably still equal to or less than 500 nm. In preferred embodiments a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or greater than 100 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 120 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 130 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 140 nm and more preferably still equal to or greater than 150 nm. Measurement of synthetic nanocarrier dimensions e.g. diameter is obtained by suspending the synthetic nanocarriers in a liquid usually aqueous media and using dynamic light scattering DLS e.g. using a Brookhaven ZetaPALS instrument . For example a suspension of synthetic nanocarriers can be diluted from an aqueous buffer into purified water to achieve a final synthetic nanocarrier suspension concentration of approximately 0.01 to 0.1 mg mL. The diluted suspension may be prepared directly inside or transferred to a suitable cuvette for DLS analysis. The cuvette may then be placed in the DLS allowed to equilibrate to the controlled temperature and then scanned for sufficient time to acquire a stable and reproducible distribution based on appropriate inputs for viscosity of the medium and refractive indicies of the sample. The effective diameter or mean of the distribution is then reported. Dimension or size or diameter of synthetic nanocarriers means the mean of a particle size distribution obtained using dynamic light scattering.

 MHC refers to major histocompatibility complex a large genomic region or gene family found in most vertebrates that encodes MHC molecules that display fragments or epitopes of processed proteins on the cell surface. The presentation of MHC peptide on cell surfaces allows for surveillance by immune cells usually a T cell. There are two general classes of MHC molecules Class I and Class II. Generally Class I MHC molecules are found on nucleated cells and present peptides to cytotoxic T cells. Class II MHC molecules are found on certain immune cells chiefly macrophages B cells and dendritic cells collectively known as professional APCs. The best known genes in the MHC region are the subset that encodes antigen presenting proteins on the cell surface. In humans these genes are referred to as human leukocyte antigen HLA genes.

Any other therapeutic and or prophylactic effect may also be assessed instead of or in addition to the aforementioned immune responses. Whether or not a protocol had a desired effect can be determined using any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art. For example a population of cells may be obtained from a subject to which a composition provided herein has been administered according to a specific protocol in order to determine whether or not specific immune cells cytokines antibodies etc. were reduced generated activated etc. Useful methods for detecting the presence and or number of immune cells include but are not limited to flow cytometric methods e.g. FACS and immunohistochemistry methods. Antibodies and other binding agents for specific staining of immune cell markers are commercially available. Such kits typically include staining reagents for multiple antigens that allow for FACS based detection separation and or quantitation of a desired cell population from a heterogeneous population of cells.

In embodiments a composition with substantially no B cell epitopes does not contain a measurable amount of B cell epitopes of an antigen. In other embodiments such a composition may comprise a measurable amount of B cell epitopes of an antigen but said amount is not effective to generate a measurable B cell immune response by itself within the context of the antigen in conjunction with a carrier or in conjunction with an inventive composition such as antigen specific antibody production or antigen specific B cell proliferation and or activity or is not effective to generate a significant measurable B cell immune response by itself within the context of the antigen in conjunction with a carrier or in conjunction with an inventive composition . In some embodiments a significant measurable B cell immune response is one that produces or would be expected to produce an adverse clinical result in a subject. In other embodiments a significant measurable B cell immune response is one that is greater than the level of the same type of immune response e.g. antigen specific antibody production or antigen specific B cell proliferation and or activity produced by a control antigen e.g. one known not to comprise B cell epitopes of the antigen or to stimulate B cell immune responses . In some embodiments a significant measurable B cell immune response such as a measurement of antibody titers e.g. by ELISA is 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold 5 fold 6 fold 7 fold 8 fold 9 fold 10 fold 15 fold 20 fold or more greater than the same type of response produced by a control e.g. control antigen . In other embodiments a composition with substantially no B cell epitopes is one that produces little to no antigen specific antibody titers by itself within the context of the antigen in conjunction with a carrier or in conjunction with an inventive composition . Such compositions include those that produce an antibody titer as an EC50 value of less than 500 400 300 200 100 50 40 30 20 or 10. In other embodiments a significant measurable B cell immune response is a measurement of the number or proliferation of B cells that is 10 25 50 100 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold 5 fold 6 fold 7 fold 8 fold 9 fold 10 fold 15 fold 20 fold or more greater that the same type of response produced by a control. Other methods for measuring B cell responses are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In embodiments to ensure that a composition comprises substantially no B cell epitopes antigens are selected such that they do not comprise B cell epitopes for coupling to the synthetic nanocarriers as provided herein. In other embodiments to ensure that a composition comprises substantially no B cell epitopes of an antigen the synthetic nanocarriers coupled to the antigen are produced and tested for B cell immune responses e.g. antigen specific antibody production B cell proliferation and or activity .

 Therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen means an antigen that is associated with a therapeutic protein i.e. the therapeutic protein or a fragment thereof can generate an immune response against the therapeutic protein e.g. the production of therapeutic protein specific antibodies . Generally therapeutic protein APC presentable antigens can be presented for recognition by the immune system e.g. cells of the immune system such as presented by antigen presenting cells including but not limited to dendritic cells B cells or macrophages . The therapeutic protein APC presentable antigen can be presented for recognition by for example T cells. Such antigens may be recognized by and trigger an immune response in a T cell via presentation of an epitope of the antigen bound to a Class I or Class II major histocompatability complex molecule MHC . Therapeutic protein APC presentable antigens generally include proteins polypeptides peptides lipoproteins or are contained or expressed in on or by cells. The therapeutic protein antigens in some embodiments are coupled to synthetic nanocarriers and comprise MHC Class I restricted epitopes and or MHC Class II restricted epitopes and or B cell epitopes. In other embodiments the antigens do not comprise B cell epitopes such as when the inclusion of the B cell epitopes would exacerbate an undesired immune response. In other embodiments the antigens comprise MHC Class II restricted epitopes and substantially no B cell epitopes. Preferably one or more tolerogenic immune responses specific to the therapeutic protein result with the compositions provided herein.

 Tolerogenic immune response means any immune response that can lead to immune suppression specific to an antigen or a cell tissue organ etc. that expresses such an antigen. Such immune responses include any reduction delay or inhibition in an undesired immune response specific to the antigen or cell tissue organ etc. that expresses such antigen. Such immune responses also include any stimulation production induction promotion or recruitment in a desired immune response specific to the antigen or cell tissue organ etc. that expresses such antigen. Tolerogenic immune responses therefore include the absence of or reduction in an undesired immune response to an antigen that can be mediated by antigen reactive cells as well as the presence or promotion of suppressive cells. Tolerogenic immune responses as provided herein include immunological tolerance. To generate a tolerogenic immune response refers to the generation of any of the foregoing immune responses specific to an antigen or cell tissue organ etc. that expresses such antigen. The tolerogenic immune response can be the result of MHC Class I restricted presentation and or MHC Class II restricted presentation and or B cell presentation and or presentation by CD1d etc.

Tolerogenic immune responses include any reduction delay or inhibition in CD4 T cell CD8 T cell or B cell proliferation and or activity. Tolerogenic immune responses also include a reduction in antigen specific antibody production. Tolerogenic immune responses can also include any response that leads to the stimulation induction production or recruitment of regulatory cells such as CD4 Treg cells CD8 Treg cells Breg cells etc. In some embodiments the tolerogenic immune response is one that results in the conversion to a regulatory phenotype characterized by the production induction stimulation or recruitment of regulatory cells.

Tolerogenic immune responses also include any response that leads to the stimulation production or recruitment of CD4 Treg cells and or CD8 Treg cells. CD4 Treg cells can express the transcription factor FoxP3 and inhibit inflammatory responses and auto immune inflammatory diseases Human regulatory T cells in autoimmune diseases. Cvetanovich G L Hafler D A. Curr Opin Immunol. 2010 December 22 6 753 60. Regulatory T cells and autoimmunity. Vila J Isaacs J D Anderson A E. Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 July 16 4 274 9 . Such cells also suppress T cell help to B cells and induce tolerance to both self and foreign antigens Therapeutic approaches to allergy and autoimmunity based on FoxP3 regulatory T cell activation and expansion. Miyara M Wing K Sakaguchi S. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 April 123 4 749 55 . CD4 Treg cells recognize antigen when presented by Class II proteins on APCs. CD8 Treg cells which recognize antigen presented by Class I and Qa 1 can also suppress T cell help to B cells and result in activation of antigen specific suppression inducing tolerance to both self and foreign antigens. Disruption of the interaction of Qa 1 with CD8 Treg cells has been shown to dysregulate immune responses and results in the development of auto antibody formation and an auto immune lethal systemic lupus erythematosus Kim et al. Nature. 2010 Sep. 16 467 7313 328 32 . CD8 Treg cells have also been shown to inhibit models of autoimmune inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and colitis CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells in autoimmune arthritis. Oh S Rankin A L Caton A J. Immunol. Rev. 2010 January 233 1 97 111. Regulatory T cells in inflammatory bowel disease. Boden E K Snapper S B. Curr Opin Gastroenterol. 2008 November 24 6 733 41 . In some embodiments the compositions provided can effectively result in both types of responses CD4 Treg and CD8 Treg . In other embodiments FoxP3 can be induced in other immune cells such as macrophages iNKT cells etc. and the compositions provided herein can result in one or more of these responses as well.

Tolerogenic immune responses also include but are not limited to the induction of regulatory cytokines such as Treg cytokines induction of inhibitory cytokines the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines e.g. IL 4 IL 1b IL 5 TNF IL 6 GM CSF IFN IL 2 IL 9 IL 12 IL 17 IL 18 IL 21 IL 22 IL 23 M CSF C reactive protein acute phase protein chemokines e.g. MCP 1 RANTES MIP 1 MIP 1 MIG ITAC or IP 10 the production of anti inflammatory cytokines e.g. IL 4 IL 13 IL 10 etc. chemokines e.g. CCL 2 CXCL8 proteases e.g. MMP 3 MMP 9 leukotrienes e.g. CysLT 1 CysLT 2 prostaglandins e.g. PGE2 or histamines the inhibition of polarization to a Th17 Th1 or Th2 immune response the inhibition of effector cell specific cytokines Th17 e.g. IL 17 IL 25 Th1 IFN Th2 e.g. IL 4 IL 13 the inhibition of Th1 Th2 or TH17 specific transcription factors the inhibition of proliferation of effector T cells the induction of apoptosis of effector T cells the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cell specific genes the induction of FoxP3 expression the inhibition of IgE induction or IgE mediated immune responses the inhibition of antibody responses e.g. antigen specific antibody production the inhibition of T helper cell response the production of TGF and or IL 10 the inhibition of effector function of autoantibodies e.g. inhibition in the depletion of cells cell or tissue damage or complement activation etc.

Any of the foregoing may be measured in vivo in one or more animal models or may be measured in vitro. One of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with such in vivo or in vitro measurements. Undesired immune responses or tolerogenic immune responses can be monitored using for example methods of assessing immune cell number and or function tetramer analysis ELISPOT flow cytometry based analysis of cytokine expression cytokine secretion cytokine expression profiling gene expression profiling protein expression profiling analysis of cell surface markers PCR based detection of immune cell receptor gene usage see T. Clay et al. Assays for Monitoring Cellular Immune Response to Active Immunotherapy of Cancer Clinical Cancer Research 7 1127 1135 2001 etc. Undesired immune responses or tolerogenic immune responses may also be monitored using for example methods of assessing protein levels in plasma or serum immune cell proliferation and or functional assays etc. In some embodiments tolerogenic immune responses can be monitored by assessing the induction of FoxP3. In addition specific methods are described in more detail in the Examples.

Preferably tolerogenic immune responses lead to the inhibition of the development progression or pathology of the diseases disorders or conditions described herein. Whether or not the inventive compositions can lead to the inhibition of the development progression or pathology of the diseases disorders or conditions described herein can be measured with animal models of such diseases disorders or conditions. In some embodiments the reduction of an undesired immune response or generation of a tolerogenic immune response may be assessed by determining clinical endpoints clinical efficacy clinical symptoms disease biomarkers and or clinical scores. Undesired immune responses or tolerogenic immune responses can also be assessed with diagnostic tests to assess the presence or absence of a disease disorder or condition as provided herein. Undesired immune responses can further be assessed by methods of measuring therapeutic proteins levels and or function in a subject.

In some embodiments monitoring or assessing the generation of an undesired immune response or a tolerogenic immune response in a subject can be prior to the administration of a composition of synthetic nanocarriers provided herein and or prior to administration of a therapeutic protein. In other embodiments assessing the generation of an undesired immune response or tolerogenic immune response can be after administration of a composition of synthetic nanocarriers provided herein and or and after administration of a therapeutic protein. In some embodiments the assessment is done after administration of the composition of synthetic nanocarriers but prior to administration of the therapeutic protein. In other embodiments the assessment is done after administration of the therapeutic protein but prior to administration of the composition. In still other embodiments the assessment is performed prior to both the administration of the synthetic nanocarriers and the therapeutic protein while in yet other embodiments the assessment is performed after administration of both the synthetic nanocarriers and the therapeutic protein. In further embodiments the assessment is performed both prior to and after the administration of the synthetic nanocarriers and or the therapeutic protein. In still other embodiments the assessment is performed more than once on the subject to determine that a desirable immune state is maintained in the subject such as a subject that has been is being or will be administered a therapeutic protein.

An antibody response can be assessed by determining one or more antibody titers. Antibody titer means a measurable level of antibody production. Methods for measuring antibody titers are known in the art and include Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA . In embodiments the antibody response can be quantitated for example as the number of antibodies concentration of antibodies or titer. The values can be absolute or they can be relative. Assays for quantifying an antibody response include antibody capture assays enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs inhibition liquid phase absorption assays ILPAAs rocket immunoelectrophoresis RIE assays and line immunoelectrophoresis LIE assays. When an antibody response is compared to another antibody response the same type of quantitative value e.g. titer and method of measurement e.g. ELISA is preferably used to make the comparison.

An ELISA method for measuring an antibody titer for example a typical sandwich ELISA may consist of the following steps i preparing an ELISA plate coating material such that the antibody target of interest is coupled to a substrate polymer or other suitable material ii preparing the coating material in an aqueous solution such as PBS and delivering the coating material solution to the wells of a multiwell plate for overnight deposition of the coating onto the multiwell plate iii thoroughly washing the multiwell plate with wash buffer such as 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS to remove excess coating material iv blocking the plate for nonspecific binding by applying a diluent solution such as 10 fetal bovine serum in PBS v washing the blocking diluent solution from the plate with wash buffer vi diluting the serum sample s containing antibodies and appropriate standards positive controls with diluent as required to obtain a concentration that suitably saturates the ELISA response vii serially diluting the plasma samples on the multiwell plate such to cover a range of concentrations suitable for generating an ELISA response curve viii incubating the plate to provide for antibody target binding ix washing the plate with wash buffer to remove antibodies not bound to antigen x adding an appropriate concentration of a secondary detection antibody in same diluent such as a biotin coupled detection antibody capable of binding the primary antibody xi incubating the plate with the applied detection antibody followed by washing with wash buffer xii adding an enzyme such as streptavidin HRP horse radish peroxidase that will bind to biotin found on biotinylated antibodies and incubating xiii washing the multiwell plate xiv adding substrate s such as TMB solution to the plate xv applying a stop solution such as 2N sulfuric acid when color development is complete xvi reading optical density of the plate wells at a specific wavelength for the substrate 450 nm with subtraction of readings at 570 nm xvi applying a suitable multiparameter curve fit to the data and defining half maximal effective concentration EC50 as the concentration on the curve at which half the maximum OD value for the plate standards is achieved.

In some embodiments polymers can be linear or branched polymers. In some embodiments polymers can be dendrimers. In some embodiments polymers can be substantially cross linked to one another. In some embodiments polymers can be substantially free of cross links. In some embodiments polymers can be used in accordance with the present invention without undergoing a cross linking step. It is further to be understood that inventive synthetic nanocarriers may comprise block copolymers graft copolymers blends mixtures and or adducts of any of the foregoing and other polymers. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the polymers listed herein represent an exemplary not comprehensive list of polymers that can be of use in accordance with the present invention.

In some embodiments synthetic nanocarriers do not comprise a polymeric component. In some embodiments synthetic nanocarriers may comprise metal particles quantum dots ceramic particles etc. In some embodiments a non polymeric synthetic nanocarrier is an aggregate of non polymeric components such as an aggregate of metal atoms e.g. gold atoms .

Compositions according to the invention comprise synthetic nanocarriers in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as preservatives buffers saline or phosphate buffered saline. The compositions may be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques to arrive at useful dosage forms. In an embodiment inventive synthetic nanocarriers are suspended in sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative.

In embodiments when preparing synthetic nanocarriers as carriers methods for coupling components to the synthetic nanocarriers may be useful. If the component is a small molecule it may be of advantage to attach the component to a polymer prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments it may also be an advantage to prepare the synthetic nanocarriers with surface groups that are used to couple the component to the synthetic nanocarrier through the use of these surface groups rather than attaching the component to a polymer and then using this polymer conjugate in the construction of synthetic nanocarriers.

In certain embodiments the coupling can be a covalent linker. In embodiments peptides according to the invention can be covalently coupled to the external surface via a 1 2 3 triazole linker formed by the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azido groups on the surface of the nanocarrier with antigen or immunosuppressant containing an alkyne group or by the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkynes on the surface of the nanocarrier with antigens or immunosuppressants containing an azido group. Such cycloaddition reactions are preferably performed in the presence of a Cu I catalyst along with a suitable Cu I ligand and a reducing agent to reduce Cu II compound to catalytic active Cu I compound. This Cu I catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition CuAAC can also be referred as the click reaction.

Additionally the covalent coupling may comprise a covalent linker that comprises an amide linker a disulfide linker a thioether linker a hydrazone linker a hydrazide linker an imine or oxime linker an urea or thiourea linker an amidine linker an amine linker and a sulfonamide linker.

An amide linker is formed via an amide bond between an amine on one component such as an antigen or immunosuppressant with the carboxylic acid group of a second component such as the nanocarrier. The amide bond in the linker can be made using any of the conventional amide bond forming reactions with suitably protected amino acids and activated carboxylic acid such N hydroxysuccinimide activated ester.

A disulfide linker is made via the formation of a disulfide S S bond between two sulfur atoms of the form for instance of R1 S S R2. A disulfide bond can be formed by thiol exchange of a component containing thiol mercaptan group SH with another activated thiol group on a polymer or nanocarrier or a nanocarrier containing thiol mercaptan groups with a component containing activated thiol group.

In embodiments a polymer containing an azide or alkyne group terminal to the polymer chain is prepared. This polymer is then used to prepare a synthetic nanocarrier in such a manner that a plurality of the alkyne or azide groups are positioned on the surface of that nanocarrier. Alternatively the synthetic nanocarrier can be prepared by another route and subsequently functionalized with alkyne or azide groups. The component is prepared with the presence of either an alkyne if the polymer contains an azide or an azide if the polymer contains an alkyne group. The component is then allowed to react with the nanocarrier via the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction with or without a catalyst which covalently couples the component to the particle through the 1 4 disubstituted 1 2 3 triazole linker.

A thioether linker is made by the formation of a sulfur carbon thioether bond in the form for instance of R1 S R2. Thioether can be made by either alkylation of a thiol mercaptan SH group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide or epoxide on a second component. Thioether linkers can also be formed by Michael addition of a thiol mercaptan group on one component to an electron deficient alkene group on a second component containing a maleimide group or vinyl sulfone group as the Michael acceptor. In another way thioether linkers can be prepared by the radical thiol ene reaction of a thiol mercaptan group on one component with an alkene group on a second component.

A hydrazone linker is made by the reaction of a hydrazide group on one component with an aldehyde ketone group on the second component.

A hydrazide linker is formed by the reaction of a hydrazine group on one component with a carboxylic acid group on the second component. Such reaction is generally performed using chemistry similar to the formation of amide bond where the carboxylic acid is activated with an activating reagent.

An imine or oxime linker is formed by the reaction of an amine or N alkoxyamine or aminooxy group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component.

An urea or thiourea linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an isocyanate or thioisocyanate group on the second component.

An amidine linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an imidoester group on the second component.

An amine linker is made by the alkylation reaction of an amine group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide epoxide or sulfonate ester group on the second component. Alternatively an amine linker can also be made by reductive amination of an amine group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component with a suitable reducing reagent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride.

A sulfonamide linker is made by the reaction of an amine group on one component with a sulfonyl halide such as sulfonyl chloride group on the second component.

A sulfone linker is made by Michael addition of a nucleophile to a vinyl sulfone. Either the vinyl sulfone or the nucleophile may be on the surface of the nanocarrier or attached to a component.

The component can also be conjugated to the nanocarrier via non covalent conjugation methods. For example a negative charged antigen or immunosuppressant can be conjugated to a positive charged nanocarrier through electrostatic adsorption. A component containing a metal ligand can also be conjugated to a nanocarrier containing a metal complex via a metal ligand complex.

In embodiments the component can be attached to a polymer for example polylactic acid block polyethylene glycol prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarrier or the synthetic nanocarrier can be formed with reactive or activatible groups on its surface. In the latter case the component may be prepared with a group which is compatible with the attachment chemistry that is presented by the synthetic nanocarriers surface. In other embodiments a peptide component can be attached to VLPs or liposomes using a suitable linker. A linker is a compound or reagent that capable of coupling two molecules together. In an embodiment the linker can be a homobifuntional or heterobifunctional reagent as described in Hermanson 2008. For example an VLP or liposome synthetic nanocarrier containing a carboxylic group on the surface can be treated with a homobifunctional linker adipic dihydrazide ADH in the presence of EDC to form the corresponding synthetic nanocarrier with the ADH linker. The resulting ADH linked synthetic nanocarrier is then conjugated with a peptide component containing an acid group via the other end of the ADH linker on NC to produce the corresponding VLP or liposome peptide conjugate.

For detailed descriptions of available conjugation methods see Hermanson G T Bioconjugate Techniques 2nd Edition Published by Academic Press Inc. 2008. In addition to covalent attachment the component can be coupled by adsorption to a pre formed synthetic nanocarrier or it can be coupled by encapsulation during the formation of the synthetic nanocarrier.

Any immunosuppressant as provided herein can be coupled to the synthetic nanocarrier. Immunosuppressants include but are not limited to statins mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin or a rapamycin analog TGF signaling agents TGF receptor agonists histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors corticosteroids inhibitors of mitochondrial function such as rotenone P38 inhibitors NF inhibitors adenosine receptor agonists prostaglandin E2 agonists phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor proteasome inhibitors kinase inhibitors G protein coupled receptor agonists G protein coupled receptor antagonists glucocorticoids retinoids cytokine inhibitors cytokine receptor inhibitors cytokine receptor activators peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonists peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonists histone deacetylase inhibitors calcineurin inhibitors phosphatase inhibitors and oxidized ATPs.

Additional therapeutic proteins useful in accordance to aspects of this invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art and the invention is not limited in this respect.

In some embodiments a component such as an antigen or immunosuppressant may be isolated. Isolated refers to the element being separated from its native environment and present in sufficient quantities to permit its identification or use. This means for example the element may be i selectively produced by expression cloning or ii purified as by chromatography or electrophoresis. Isolated elements may be but need not be substantially pure. Because an isolated element may be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in a pharmaceutical preparation the element may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation. The element is nonetheless isolated in that it has been separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems i.e. isolated from other lipids or proteins. Any of the elements provided herein may be isolated and included in the compositions in isolated form.

Synthetic nanocarriers may be prepared using a wide variety of methods known in the art.

In certain embodiments synthetic nanocarriers are prepared by a nanoprecipitation process or spray drying. Conditions used in preparing synthetic nanocarriers may be altered to yield particles of a desired size or property e.g. hydrophobicity hydrophilicity external morphology stickiness shape etc. . The method of preparing the synthetic nanocarriers and the conditions e.g. solvent temperature concentration air flow rate etc. used may depend on the materials to be coupled to the synthetic nanocarriers and or the composition of the polymer matrix.

If particles prepared by any of the above methods have a size range outside of the desired range particles can be sized for example using a sieve.

Elements i.e. components of the inventive synthetic nanocarriers such as moieties of which an immunofeature surface is comprised targeting moieties polymeric matrices antigens immunosuppressants and the like may be coupled to the overall synthetic nanocarrier e.g. by one or more covalent bonds or may be coupled by means of one or more linkers. Additional methods of functionalizing synthetic nanocarriers may be adapted from Published US Patent Application 2006 0002852 to Saltzman et al. Published US Patent Application 2009 0028910 to DeSimone et al. or Published International Patent Application WO 2008 127532 A1 to Murthy et al.

Alternatively or additionally synthetic nanocarriers can be coupled to components directly or indirectly via non covalent interactions. In non covalent embodiments the non covalent coupling is mediated by non covalent interactions including but not limited to charge interactions affinity interactions metal coordination physical adsorption host guest interactions hydrophobic interactions TT stacking interactions hydrogen bonding interactions van der Waals interactions magnetic interactions electrostatic interactions dipole dipole interactions and or combinations thereof. Such couplings may be arranged to be on an external surface or an internal surface of an inventive synthetic nanocarrier. In embodiments encapsulation and or absorption is a form of coupling. In embodiments the inventive synthetic nanocarriers can be combined with an antigen by admixing in the same vehicle or delivery system.

Populations of synthetic nanocarriers may be combined to form pharmaceutical dosage forms according to the present invention using traditional pharmaceutical mixing methods. These include liquid liquid mixing in which two or more suspensions each containing one or more subsets of nanocarriers are directly combined or are brought together via one or more vessels containing diluent. As synthetic nanocarriers may also be produced or stored in a powder form dry powder powder mixing could be performed as could the re suspension of two or more powders in a common media.

The purpose of this experiment was to assess the effects of encapsulated tSVP immunosuppressant on ongoing antibody responses by measuring antigen specific immunogloblulins. One group of animals remained unimmunized as a control. Two groups of animals were immunized using passive administration of Ovalbumin or active immunization with OVA and CpG with 3 injections d0 d14 and d28 followed by an assessment of antibody titers and one or two weeks of rest. Another two groups received the same immunizations but received boosts every 2 weeks at the same time they received the treatment. Each of these groups was split into three subgroups to test the capacity of different treatments to modify the Ig titers induced. A control subgroup did not receive tolerogenic treatment. Two other treatments were applied to the other subgroups including NP carrying just OVA protein or in combination with immunosuppressant.

For immunization animals received 20 l limb of OVA CpG 12.5 g OVA 10 g CpG both hind limbs s.c. or 25 g of OVA i.v. in 100 l. The tolerogenic treatment included administration of 200 l tSVP i.v. using 10 g of OVA. Nanoparticles were provided at 500 m ml of OVA content. tSVP was diluted in such a manner that the same amounts of OVA were injected in all groups

The level of IgG antibodies were measured. Blocker Casein in PBS Thermo Fisher Catalog 37528 was used as diluent. 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS was used as wash buffer prepared by adding 10 ml of Tween 20 Sigma Catalog P9416 100 mL to 2 liters of a 10 PBS stock PBS OmniPur 10 PBS Liquid Concentrate 4 L EMD Chemicals Catalog 6505 and 18 Liters of deionized water.

OVA protein at a stock concentration of 5 mg ml was used as a coating material. A 1 1000 dilution to 5 g ml was used as a working concentration. Each well of the assay plates was coated with 100 l diluted OVA per well plates were sealed with sealing film VWR catalog 60941 120 and incubated overnight at 4 C. Costar9017 96 well Flat bottom plates were used as assay plates Costar9017.

Low binding polypropylene 96 well plate or tubes were used as set up plates in which samples were prepared before being transferred to the assay plate. The setup plates did not contain any antigen and therefore serum antibodies did not bind to the plate during the setup of the samples. Setup plates were used for sample preparation to minimize binding that might occur during preparation or pipetting of samples if an antigen coated plate was used to prepare the samples. Before preparing samples in the setup plate wells were covered with diluent to block any non specific binding and the plate was sealed and incubated at 4 C. overnight.

Assay plates were washed three times with wash buffer and wash buffer was completely aspirated out of the wells after the last wash. After washing 300 l diluent were added to each well of assay plate s to block non specific binding and plates were incubated at least 2 hours at room temperature. Serum samples were prepared in the setup plate at appropriate starting dilutions. Starting dilutions were sometimes also prepared in 1.5 ml tubes using diluent. Appropriate starting dilutions were determined based on previous data where available. Where no previous data was available the lowest starting dilution was 1 40. Once diluted 200 l of the starting dilution of the serum sample was transferred from to the appropriate well of the setup plate.

An exemplary setup plate layout is described as follows Columns 2 and 11 contained anti Ovabumin monoclonal IgG2b isotype AbCam ab17291 standard diluted to 1 g mL 1 4000 dilution . Columns 3 10 contained serum samples at appropriate dilutions . Columns 1 and 12 were not used for samples or standards to avoid any bias of measurements due to edge effect. Instead columns 1 and 12 contained 200 l diluent. Normal mouse serum diluted 1 40 was used as a negative control. Anti mouse IgG2a diluted 1 500 from 0.5 mg mL stock BD Bioscience was used as an isotype control.

Once all samples were prepared in the setup plate the plate was sealed and stored at 4 C. until blocking of the assay plates was complete. Assay plates were washed three times with wash buffer and wash buffer was completely aspirated after the last wash. After washing 100 L of diluent was added to all wells in rows B H of the assay plates. A 12 channel pipet was used to transfer samples from the setup plate to the assay plate. Samples were mixed prior to transfer by pipetting 150 l of diluted serum up and down 3 times. After mixing 1500 of each sample was transferred from the setup plate and added to row A of the respective assay plate.

Once the starting dilutions of each sample were transferred from the setup plate to row A of the assay plate serial dilutions were pipetted on the assay plate as follows 50 l of each serum sample was removed from row A using 12 channel pipet and mixed with the 100 l of diluent previously added to each well of row B. This step was repeated down the entire plate. After pipetting the dilution of the final row 50 l of fluid was removed from the wells in the final row and discarded resulting in a final volume of 100 l in every well of the assay plate. Once sample dilutions were prepared in the assay plates the plates were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

After the incubation plates were washed three times with wash buffer. Detection antibody Goat anti mouse anti IgG HRP conjugated AbCam ab98717 was diluted 1 1500 0.33 g mL in diluent and 100 l of the diluted antibody was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed three times with wash buffer with each washing step including a soak time of at least 30 seconds.

After washing detection substrate was added to the wells. Equal parts of substrate A and substrate B BD Biosciences TMB Substrate Reagent Set catalog 555214 were combined immediately before addition to the assay plates and 100 l of the mixed substrate solution were added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of stop solution 2NH2SO4 to each well after the 10 minute period. The optical density OD of the wells was assessed immediately after adding the stop solution on a plate reader at 450 nm with subtraction at 570 nm. Data analysis was performed using Molecular Device s software SoftMax Pro v5.4. In some cases a four parameter logistic curve fit graph was prepared with the dilution on the x axis log scale and the OD value on the y axis linear scale and the half maximum value EC50 for each sample was determined. The plate template at the top of the layout was adjusted to reflect the dilution of each sample 1 per column .

The purpose of this experiment was to assess the effects of encapsulated tSVP immunosuppressant on emerging antibody responses by measuring antigen specific immunogloblulins in animals that receive the immunogen and NP treatment at the same time. One group of animals remained unimmunized as a control but received the treatment . A second group of animals was immunized using passive administration of Ovalbumin and a third group was immunized with OVA and CpG in the sub scapular region. Each of these groups were given biweekly injection of nanoparticles NPs and anti OVA Ig levels were monitored on the day previous to the boost. For immunization animals received 100 l of OVA CpG s.c. subscapular or 25 g of OVA i.v. in 1004 Tolerogenic treatment comprised administration of 100 l tSVP i.v. Nanocarriers were provided at 5 mg ml. t2SVP was diluted in such a manner that the same amounts of OVA were injected in all groups. Injections were performed at d0 d14 d28 d42 d56.

Animals received immunization every 2 weeks at the same time they received the treatment. Each of these groups was split into subgroups to test the capacity of different treatments to modify the Ig titers induced. A control subgroup did not receive tolerogenic treatment. Two subgroups received nanocarrier carrying just OVApeptide or in combination with rapamycin.

Immunization was administered via the following routes values are per animal 20 l limb of OVA CpG 12.5 g OVA 10 g CpG both hind limbs s.c. Tolerogenic treatments were administered via the following route values are per animal 200 l nanocarriers were provided at 100 g ml of OVAcontent.

The level of IgG antibodies were measured. Blocker Casein in PBS Thermo Fisher Catalog 37528 was used as diluent. 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS was used as wash buffer prepared by adding 10 ml of Tween 20 Sigma Catalog P9416 100 mL to 2 liters of a 10 PBS stock PBS OmniPur 10 PBS Liquid Concentrate 4 L EMD Chemicals Catalog 6505 and 18 Liters of deionized water.

OVA protein at a stock concentration of 5 mg ml was used as a coating material. A 1 1000 dilution to 5 g ml was used as a working concentration. Each well of the assay plates was coated with 100 l diluted OVA per well plates were sealed with sealing film VWR catalog 60941 120 and incubated overnight at 4 C. Costar9017 96 well Flat bottom plates were used as assay plates Costar9017.

Low binding polypropylene 96 well plate or tubes were used as set up plates in which samples were prepared before being transferred to the assay plate. The setup plates did not contain any antigen and therefore serum antibodies did not bind to the plate during the setup of the samples. Setup plates were used for sample preparation to minimize binding that might occur during preparation or pipetting of samples if an antigen coated plate was used to prepare the samples. Before preparing samples in the setup plate wells were covered with diluent to block any non specific binding and the plate was sealed and incubated at 4 C. overnight.

Assay plates were washed three times with wash buffer and wash buffer was completely aspirated out of the wells after the last wash. After washing 300 l diluent were added to each well of assay plate s to block non specific binding and plates were incubated at least 2 hours at room temperature. Serum samples were prepared in the setup plate at appropriate starting dilutions. Starting dilutions were sometimes also prepared in 1.5 ml tubes using diluent. Appropriate starting dilutions were determined based on previous data where available. Where no previous data was available the lowest starting dilution was 1 40. Once diluted 200 l of the starting dilution of the serum sample was transferred from to the appropriate well of the setup plate.

An exemplary setup plate layout is described as follows Columns 2 and 11 contained anti Ovabumin monoclonal IgG2b isotype AbCam ab17291 standard diluted to 1 g mL 1 4000 dilution . Columns 3 10 contained serum samples at appropriate dilutions . Columns 1 and 12 were not used for samples or standards to avoid any bias of measurements due to edge effect. Instead columns 1 and 12 contained 200 l diluent. Normal mouse serum diluted 1 40 was used as a negative control. Anti mouse IgG2a diluted 1 500 from 0.5 mg mL stock BD Bioscience was used as an isotype control.

Once all samples were prepared in the setup plate the plate was sealed and stored at 4 C. until blocking of the assay plates was complete. Assay plates were washed three times with wash buffer and wash buffer was completely aspirated after the last wash. After washing 100 L of diluent was added to all wells in rows B H of the assay plates. A 12 channel pipet was used to transfer samples from the setup plate to the assay plate. Samples were mixed prior to transfer by pipetting 150 l of diluted serum up and down 3 times. After mixing 150 l of each sample was transferred from the setup plate and added to row A of the respective assay plate.

Once the starting dilutions of each sample were transferred from the setup plate to row A of the assay plate serial dilutions were pipetted on the assay plate as follows 50 l of each serum sample was removed from row A using 12 channel pipet and mixed with the 100 l of diluent previously added to each well of row B. This step was repeated down the entire plate. After pipetting the dilution of the final row 50 l of fluid was removed from the wells in the final row and discarded resulting in a final volume of 100 l in every well of the assay plate. Once sample dilutions were prepared in the assay plates the plates were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

After the incubation plates were washed three times with wash buffer. Detection antibody Goat anti mouse anti IgG HRP conjugated AbCam ab98717 was diluted 1 1500 0.33 g mL in diluent and 100 l of the diluted antibody was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed three times with wash buffer with each washing step including a soak time of at least 30 seconds.

After washing detection substrate was added to the wells. Equal parts of substrate A and substrate B BD Biosciences TMB Substrate Reagent Set catalog 555214 were combined immediately before addition to the assay plates and 100 l of the mixed substrate solution were added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of stop solution 2NH2SO4 to each well after the 10 minute period. The optical density OD of the wells was assessed immediately after adding the stop solution on a plate reader at 450 nm with subtraction at 570 nm. Data analysis was performed using Molecular Device s software SoftMax Pro v5.4. In some cases a four parameter logistic curve fit graph was prepared with the dilution on the x axis log scale and the OD value on the y axis linear scale and the half maximum value EC50 for each sample was determined. The plate template at the top of the layout was adjusted to reflect the dilution of each sample 1 per column .

Ovalbumin B cell division was assessed by flow cytometry. Splenocytes from experimental animals were stained with Cell Tracker Orange CTO a thiol reactive fluorescent probe suitable for long term cell labeling and cultured in complete media at 37 C 5 COwith Ovalbumin protein or peptide for 3 days. On day 3 the cells were washed blocked with anti CD16 32 antibody and then stained with conjugated antibodies specific to B220 and CD19. Alexa 647 conjugated ovalbumin protein was also incubated with the cells to label Ovalbumin specific BCRs. Those splenocytes that were CD19 B220 VA Alexa647 were assessed for proliferation by comparing the differential CTO staining. Those that were CTO low were labeled as proliferating Ovalbumin B cells and were compared to the CTO high Ovalbumin B cells to quantify the percentages.

The nanocarriers were thawed and equilibrated. Initial dilutions constituted a 10 stock solution and were further diluted to a concentration of 100 g ml in OVA or a 1 solution. This 1 solution was used for injections at 200 l per i.v. injection. Animals were immunized with OVA protein OVA and treated with OVApeptide to assess the capacity of nanocarriers to control the immune responses in absence of B cell antigens. Immunization routes were as follows 10 g of OVA 4 mg Alum i.p. in 4000 per each Balb C immunologically na ve female mouse. Experimental groups consisted of 5 animals each. Spleen cells were restimulated with antigen using CFSE or CTO to determine the amount of Ag specific proliferation.

FCS files were analyzed using FlowJo software. 7AAD positive cells a nuclear dye that label dead cells positive cells were excluded and cell morphologies dependent on expression of CD4 CD8 Gr 1 F4 80 B220 TCRb and CD11b were quantified.

The frequency of Ovalbumin reactive CD4 T cells was calculated by way of flow cytometry. Splenocytes from experimental animals were stained with CFSE a thiol reactive Fluorescent Probe suitable for long term cell labeling and cultured in complete media at 37 C 5 COwith Ovalbumin protein for 3 days. On day 3 the cells were washed blocked with anti CD16 32 antibody and then stained with conjugated antibodies specific to TCR CD4 and CD8a. Splenocytes that were TCR CD4 or TCR CD8a were assessed for proliferation by comparing the differential CFSE staining.
