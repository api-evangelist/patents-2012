The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates to the generation of images from projection measurements. Examples of images generated from projection measurements include two dimensional and three dimensional SAR synthetic aperture radar systems. SAR is a form of radar in which the large highly directional rotating antenna used by conventional radar is replaced with many low directivity small stationary antennas scattered over some area near or around the target area. The many echo waveforms received at the different antenna positions are post processed to resolve the target. SAR can be implemented by moving one or more antennas over relatively immobile targets by placing multiple stationary antennas over a relatively large area or combinations thereof. A further example of images generated from projection measurements are ISAR inverse SAR systems which image objects and many features on the ground from satellites aircraft vehicles or any other moving platform. SAR and ISAR systems are used in detecting locating and sometimes identifying ships ground vehicles mines buried pipes roadway faults tunnels leaking buried pipes etc. as well as discovering and measuring geological features forest features mining volumes etc. and general mapping. For example as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 805 098 to McCorkle hereby incorporated by reference an aircraft mounted detector array is utilized to take ground radar measurements. Other examples of systems using projection measurements are fault inspection systems using acoustic imaging submarine sonar for imaging underwater objects seismic imaging system for tunnel detection oil exploration geological surveys etc. and medical diagnostic tools such as sonograms echocardiograms x ray CAT computer aided tomography equipment and MRI magnetic resonance imaging equipment.

Synthetic aperture radar SAR systems have been used in many applications to provide area mapping surveillance and target detection. The radar is usually mounted on an aircraft or a ground based vehicle configured with transmitting and receiving antennas to transmit and measure the reflected radar signals from the areas of interest. Through signal processing the reflected radar signals collected along the flight path are combined to form the SAR image for the area along one side side looking mode or in front of the radar forward looking mode .

There is a major challenge that SAR or other imaging systems must face. The resulting imagery is contaminated with 1 system noise due to system components 2 interference noise due to internal and external sources and 3 sidelobes from large targets. The first two types are additive noise and the last type sidelobes is multiplicative noise. These sources result in a high noise floor level in SAR imagery and reduce the ability of the radar system to detect small targets especially if these targets are located in the proximity of larger objects natural or manmade . For other systems such as medical imaging systems the detection of small targets subtle features tumors in the presence of noise and other large objects is also a big challenge.

There have been numerous techniques that have been developed to suppress the additive noise. Suppression of the multiplicative noise is a much more challenging task since the noise level sidelobes is proportional to the size radar cross section of the in scene targets. Conventional shift invariant windows have been used to reduce or suppress the sidelobe artifacts at the expense of resolution and a reduced signal to noise ratio SNR . A family of spatially variant apodization techniques has been developed to address the sidelobes problem. These spatially variant apodization techniques generate nonlinear imagery the phase information is not preserved in the resulting imagery . In U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 829 entitled Method and System for Forming an Image with Enhanced Contrast and or Reduced Noise a nonlinear imaging technique called Recursive Sidelobe Minimization RSM was disclosed that significantly reduces the noise level in real SAR imagery by 5 10 dB. More recently ARL invented another method Image Formation by Pixel Classification IF PC which significantly improves the suppression of the noise level over Recursive Sidelobe Minimization mage Formation by Pixel Classification achieves state of the art performance that generates virtually noise free imagery. The key idea of Image Formation by Pixel Classification is to classify each pixel of a sequence of subaperture SAR images into a real object class or a noise class based on a magnitude of the pixel s normalized standard deviation. If the normalized standard deviation is larger than a threshold the pixel is classified into the noise class. Otherwise the pixel is classified into the target class. Despite its superior performance in noise suppression Image Formation by Pixel Classification still has two important features that could be further improved. First the Image Formation by Pixel Classification technique is still based on a nonlinear signal processing technique.

The pixel classification process real object noise is computed using magnitude data and thus the results are also magnitude imagery. This type of imagery is appropriate for applications that only require magnitude information. However the complex imagery contains much more information phase and frequency response which may be the key for target discrimination and classification. Although the target noise classification information from Image Formation by Pixel Classification could be employed in conjunction with the baseline complex imagery to derive the noise reduced complex imagery this indirect operation could result in the discontinuity in the complex imagery. Second the pixel classification process in Image Formation by Pixel Classification depends on the statistics of a single pixel across multiple iterations thus does not capture the local spatial correlation across many pixels from the same object.

Systems which produce images from projection data generally use techniques in the time domain where a backprojection type algorithm is used or frequency domain where Fourier transforms are used. For example time domain backprojection based techniques have been used for numerous applications including x ray CAT scans MRI and sonograms. Historically medical people have preferred backprojection because its artifact levels were lower than those using fast Fourier transform FFT approaches.

Synthetic aperture radar systems have been used in applications such as area mapping surveillance and target detection. The radar is usually mounted on an aircraft or a vehicle configured with transmitting and receiving antennas to transmit and measure the reflected radar signals from areas of interest. Through signal processing the reflected radar signals along the flight path are combined to form the SAR imaging for side looking or forward looking surveillance.

SAR imaging is complex for a variety of reasons. First the data is not inputted at equally distant or known points. Instead data may be inputted in a non uniform manner from an aircraft that is buffeted by the wind or from a ground vehicle that traverses rough ground. Therefore motion compensation must be introduced in order to produce sharp images. Second the subject objects need not be point sources but may be dispersive where energy is stored and re radiated over time. Ground penetrating SAR adds the complication that the media propagation velocity varies which complicates seismic processing. For many SAR applications especially for high resolution ultra wide angle UWA ultra wide bandwidth UWB surveillance systems the task is particularly problematic because the data sets are large real time operation is essential and the aperture geometry is not controlled. For example small aircraft buffeted by the wind can affect SAR data due to significant off track motion and velocity changes. As a result the data is not sampled at equally spaced intervals.

Backprojection techniques provide many advantages including sharper images. Although prior art backprojector implementations may generate image artifacts they are constrained to be local to the object generating the artifacts and generally lie within the theoretical sidelobes. Side lobes are the lobes of the radiation pattern that are not the main beam or lobe. In an antenna radiation pattern or beam pattern the power density in the side lobes is generally much less than that in the main beam. It is generally desirable to minimize the sidelobe level SLL commonly measured in decibels relative to the peak of the main beam. The concepts of main and side lobes apply to but are not limited to for example radar and optics two specific applications of electromagnetics and sonar. The present invention is directed to techniques which minimize the effects of theoretical sidelobes in order to provide enhanced images.

Backprojector techniques also allow for non uniform spacing of the projection data. The non uniform spacing is directly accounted for in the index generation which is important when compensating for aircraft motion.

Conventional time domain image formation or backprojection from SAR data is accomplished by coherently summing the sampled radar returns for each pixel. In this context coherent summation can be thought of as time shifting the signal obtained at each aperture position to align them to a particular pixel and adding across all aperture positions to integrate the value at that pixel. This time align and sum sequence is repeated for every pixel in the image.

A method and system for forming images by backprojection is explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5 805 098 to McCorkle hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein.

The index is computed using the round trip distance between the transmitting element the image pixel and the receiving element. The transmitting element is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . The distance between the transmitting element and the image pixel P i is square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over 2 

The distance between the receiving element and the image pixel P i is square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over 3 The total distance is 4 The delay index is

The following is a description of the platform in as it passes four sequential positions located at x coordinates A B C D respectively. The formation of the first sub image begins when platform is at the coordinate A 20 meters from the block labeled 1sub image. As platform travels in the x direction as shown in signals emitted from platform illuminates an entire image area to the right of platform and the reflected signals are received by an array of 16 physical receiving antennas positioned on the front of the platform . Formation of the first sub image ends when platform reaches coordinate C at approximately 8 m from the block labeled 1sub image. Accordingly the radar signal data for the first full resolution sub image is received as radar platform travels a distance of 12 meters 20 m 8 m 12 m from coordinates A to C for formation of a two dimensional 2D aperture.

The distance traveled during the formation of the two dimensional 2 D aperture is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . When the platform reaches coordinate B a distance of 2 meters from coordinate A in the formation of the 2sub image begins and as the platform travels to coordinate D it uses the received data to form a second 2 D aperture. The distance traveled by platform is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . Note that the two apertures are overlapped by 10 m and the second aperture is advanced by 2 m with respect to the first aperture. Sub images and are formed from the 2 D apertures using the same length of travel 12 meters of the radar. This process is applied to ensure that image pixels have almost the same within a specified tolerance resolution across the entire large area. The sub images are formed from the radar range profiles using the back projection algorithm.

The term noise as used herein relates to image noise. There are many sources that cause noise in the resulting image. Noise can be divided into two categories additive noise and multiplicative noise. System noise thermal noise quantization noise self interference noise radio frequency interference RFI noise are some examples of the additive noise. Multiplicative noise is much more difficult to deal with since it is data dependent. Some sources that cause multiplicative noise include timing jitter in data sampling small aperture size compared to image area the under sampling of aperture samples the non uniform spacing between aperture samples errors in position measurement system etc. Multiplicative noise results in undesired sidelobes that create high noise floor in the image and thus limit the ability to detect targets with smaller amplitudes.

A preferred embodiment imaging technique computes the resulting imagery by using for example complex bipolar SAR imagery data. The preferred embodiment utilizes the classification of collaborative filtering of overlapping blocks of pixels from many realizable randomly reduced aperture SAR images. These blocks are first classified into either target class physical objects or non target class noise sidelobes based on statistics of singular values of a constructed collaboration matrix. If a block of pixels is classified to be associated with a physical object its value is computed from the largest singular value of the constructed collaboration matrix and its associated singular vectors. Otherwise the block is assumed to come from a non physical object noise source and its value is simply zero. The techniques can be used to suppress both types of noise additive and multiplicative and may be utilized to generate bipolar complex SAR imagery that is substantially noise free.

A block of pixels may be classified into either target class physical objects or non target class noise sidelobes based on statistics of singular values of the constructed collaboration matrix. If a block of pixels is classified to be associated with a physical object its value is computed from the largest singular value of the constructed collaboration matrix and its associated singular vectors. Otherwise the block is assumed to come from a non physical object noise source and its value is simply zeroed out.

The invention enables the generation of very high contrast images with greatly enhanced performance. The resulting benefits are a high contrast image with the significant reduction in the noise level b detection of targets with very small amplitudes and c the reduction in the false alarm rate. Such benefits result in a substantially improved practical system for detecting difficult targets which is an obstacle that most radar systems are facing today.

Disclosed in now U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 829 829 Patent hereby incorporated by reference is a non linear imaging algorithm that significantly improves the background noise level of the resulting image without negatively affecting the focus quality sharpness as well as the target amplitudes. In the 829 Patent this technique has been denominated as Recursive Sidelobe Minimization RSM .

As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 881 364 hereby incorporated by reference entitled Method and System for Forming Very Low Noise Imagery Using Pixel Classification hereby incorporated by reference by Lam Huy Nguyen the classification of pixels is based upon the concept that noise is transitory. Since most of the pixels in the image are classified as non targets this would generate a very low noise floor in the resulting SAR image. The remaining pixels are classified as targets. Each of these pixels will have the maximum value across many iterations. Thus the technique virtually wipes out the noise floor that includes the sidelobes and maximizes the responses from the targets. The decision statistic described to classify a pixel is the standard deviation of the pixel amplitudes across all iterations and normalized by its mean amplitude.

In this step the system collects the return radar data the coordinates of the receiver and the coordinates of the transmitter for each position k along the aperture of N positions.

The radar data at each position is 1 1 The coordinates of the receiver at each position is 1 2 The coordinates of the transmitter at each position is 1 3 

For monostatic radar that uses the same transmitting and receiving antenna the coordinates of the receivers x k y k z k are identical to the coordinates of the transmitters x k y k z k . Since the monostatic radar case is at special case of the bistatic radar configuration the algorithm described here is applicable for both configurations.

STEP 2 From the complete aperture of N positions Agenerated from step 1 generate a randomly reduced aperture 1 4 where L is the number of iterations that the algorithm computes.

The randomly reduced aperture Ais a subset of the complete aperture A. This randomly reduced aperture only consists of K positions that are randomly selected from N positions in A where K p N and 0

One approach to implement this sparse aperture is to generate a random vector for this iiteration 1 5 where the value of wis either 0 or 1. There are K elements of whaving the value of 1 and N K elements of whaving the value of 0.

STEP 3 Formation of a complex bipolar image Iusing data from the sparse aperture A from step 3 and the backprojection algorithm as described in John McCorkle Lam Nguyen Focusing of Dispersive Targets Using Synthetic Aperture Radar original ARL TR 305 August 1994 reprinted March 2010.

In order to form an image from the area of interest we generate an imaging grid that consists of M image pixels. Each pixel from the imaging grid is located at coordinates 1 6 

The imaging grid is usually defined as a 2 D or 3 D rectangular shape. In general however the image grid could be arbitrary.

In equation 7 by assigning the value of wto be either 0 or 1 the weighting factors Wdefine which aperture positions contribute to the formed image. From equation 7 although the summation is performed from 1 to N only data from K aperture positions are contributed to the final value of the image pixel since wgenerated from equation 7 only contains K non zero elements. Also note that the value of the denominator

The delay shift index f k j in equation 7 is computed based on the round trip distance between the transmitting element the image pixel and the receiving element.

The distance between the ktransmitting element and the jimage pixel is square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over 8 

The distance between the kreceiving element and the jimage pixel is square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over square root over 9 

The bipolar image which includes both amplitude and phase information using the data from the sparse aperture Ais computed as 12 

STEP 4 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for L iterations 1 i L to generate L SAR image realizations I i 1 2 . . . L .

For each overlapping block form a corresponding collective matrix C and then compute the following decision statistic that is the ratio between the largest and the second largest singular values of the matrix C 

If d where is some threshold the block is classified to be associated with a target class. Otherwise the block is classified to be associated with a noise class and as a result its pixel value is set to be zero.

If a block is classified to be associated with a target class the best rank 1 approximation of the matrix C is first computed as 14 

A noise reduced version of the current block is computed as the first column of matrix C. Note that matrix Chas rank 1 and hence all its columns are the same within a scaling factor.

Simulation data was used to illustrate the basic concept of SAR imaging in order to provide the insights why the block based collaborative filtering technique works so well at removing the noise floor.

A simulation data set was generated using a following scenario. The radar travels along a linear path transmits impulse signals to the side of the vehicle perpendicular to the path of the vehicle and captures the return data. Along the path the radar also records its coordinates at every transmit receive cycle. The coordinate measurement also introduces errors in the measurement data. There are four point targets in the scene. The data received by the radar are contaminated with additive white noise from radio frequency interference RFI sources external to the system.

There are four simulated point targets in the SAR image. The three high amplitude targets are obvious in the image. They are located at the pixel coordinates 60 200 100 250 and 140 300 respectively. There is a fourth point target that exists in the SAR image at the coordinate 125 275 . This coordinate is at the midpoint between 2and 3targets. This fourth target is not visible from the image since its radar cross section RCS is so low that its response is masked by the noise floor.

Instead of forming just one baseline SAR image in using conventional technique we first generate many SAR images of the same scene. Each SAR image is formed using a randomly reduced aperture randomly selecting only 80 of the original aperture to form each image .

A key concept in Block based Collaborative Filtering is a collective matrix of collocated blocks on SAR images. All collocated image blocks of the randomly reduced aperture SAR images are vectorized to serve as columns of the collective matrix which is denoted as C. The matrix C from equation 14 is decomposed through singular value decomposition SVD and can be rewritten as follows 

To understand the principle of this invention the statistical distribution of the singular values was investigated in two cases 

Image blocks were selected around these four targets blue blocks . Two other image blocks were also selected that contain noise speckles red blocks number and . For each of these six image blocks a corresponding collective matrix is formed and decomposed via singular value decomposition. depicts the distribution of those collective matrices singular values. As can be seen from this figure with collective matrices of blue blocks that contain targets the second largest singular value is significantly smaller than the largest singular value. Even with a very challenging target number with amplitude below the noise floor the ratio between the first singular value and the second singular value is relatively large. On the other hand with collective matrices of red blocks that contain no targets the ratio between the largest and the second largest singular values is much smaller than those for the target groups. This observation illustrates a way to classify a block that contains targets or not by looking at the ratio between the largest and the second largest singular values of the collective matrix.

The reason why this ratio was large when a block contains target objects was investigated. Consider the case when there is no noise in the SAR image reconstruction. If the SAR image reconstruction was perfect all randomly reduced SAR images would be exactly the same and hence all collocated blocks would also be the same. As a result the collective matrix would have rank 1 which implies that all of the singular values except for the largest one are zero. The ratio between the largest singular value and the second largest one would be infinitely large in this extreme case. In reality the noise floor always exists and thus the second largest singular value is nonzero. The largest singular value represents energy of the signal part while the remaining singular values represent noise energy. Hence when a block contains real backscatter responses from a target the ratio between the largest singular value and the second largest one will be large.

The resulting image is shown in . This image shows all four targets including the target which represents one very challenging case for a SAR imaging system. The noise floor generated by the additive white noise and the sidelobes is completely wiped out from the resulting image.

Usually the application of any technique on real data is much more challenging because of many unknown factors in real systems.

The invented technique is applied to the same data to generate the SAR image of . From the SAR image is virtually noise free. All the targets of interest are detected in the SAR image using the invented technique. shows the downrange profiles through a target located at x 0 m y 176 m in the images of from both Recursive Sidelobe Minimization image and the image using the new invented technique. The downrange profiles show that while the underlying data from the Recursive Sidelobe Minimization image red contains only amplitude information the data from the image using the invented technique blue preserve both phase and amplitude information which would be valuable for subsequent target discrimination and classification stages.

Suppression of the multiplicative noise is a much more challenging task since the noise level sidelobes is proportional to the size RCS of the in scene targets. Conventional shift invariant windows have been used to reduce or suppress the sidelobe artifacts at the expense of resolution and reduced SNR. A family of spatially variant apodization techniques as reported in H. C. Stankwitz R. J. Dallaire J. R. Fienup Nonlinear Apodization for Sidelobe Control in SAR Imagery IEEE Trans. on Aerospace and Electronic System 31 1 January 1995 has been developed to address the sidelobes problem. These spatially variant apodization techniques generate nonlinear imagery the phase information is not preserved in the resulting imagery . U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 829 hereby incorporated by reference discloses a nonlinear imaging technique called RECURSIVE SIDELOBE MINIMIZATION that has been shown to be very robust and significantly reduce the noise level in real SAR imagery by 5 10 dB. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 881 364 discloses a method of image formation by pixel classification wherein pixel classification is used to classify each pixel of a sequence of subaperture SAR images into a target class or noise class based on a magnitude of the pixel s normalized standard deviation. If the normalized standard deviation is larger than a threshold the pixel is classified into the noise class. Otherwise the pixel is classified into the target class. Despite its superior performance in noise suppression image formation by pixel classification still has two important features that could be further improved. First the image formation by pixel classification technique is still based on nonlinear signal processing technique. The pixel classification process real object noise is computed using magnitude data and thus the results are also magnitude imagery. This type of imagery is appropriate for applications that only require magnitude information. However the complex imagery contains much more information phase and frequency response which may be the key for target discrimination and classification. Although the target noise classification information from image formation by pixel classification could be employed in conjunction with the baseline complex imagery to derive the noise reduced complex imagery this indirect operation could result in the discontinuity in the complex imagery. Second the pixel classification process image formation by pixel classification depends on the statistics of a single pixel across multiple iterations thus does not capture the local spatial correlation across many pixels from the same object.

This new invention may significantly improve the performance as well as the robustness of the Recursive Sidelobe Minimization and image formation by pixel classification techniques. The new invention also generates virtually noise free imagery and providing both amplitude and phase information. The key innovative concept in this invention is collaborative filtering of overlapping blocks of pixels from many realizable sparse aperture SAR images. Blocks of pixels are first classified into either target class physical objects or non target class noise sidelobes based on statistics of singular values of the constructed collaboration matrix. If a block of pixels is classified to be associated with a physical object its value is computed from the largest singular value of the constructed collaboration matrix and its associated singular vectors. Otherwise the block is assumed to come from a non physical object noise source and its value is simply zeroed out.

This new invention has two main advantages over Recursive Sidelobe Minimization and image formation by pixel classification techniques. First the block classification process in block based collaborative filtering is computed using bipolar complex image data thus the resulting complex image data are directly obtained. This information from the full complex data instead of magnitude data as in Recursive Sidelobe Minimization or image formation by pixel classification is the key for target discrimination and classification. Second block based collaborative filtering feature in the new invention is more robust than the current state of the art image formation by pixel classification due to the block classification process using complex data rather than a single pixel classification process using magnitude data . Block classification exploits spatial correlation among neighbor pixels better than single pixel classification. Block classification is less susceptible to the threshold parameter as the threshold tends to be more stable over block level than over pixel level in image formation by pixel classification. In addition this invention classifies overlapping blocks and then denoises them. The final SAR image is computed from averaging those denoised overlapping blocks. A pixel which belongs to multiple overlapping blocks is classified and then denoised multiple times. As a result the new invented technique is less susceptible to pixel misclassification than image formation by pixel classification.

The positioning information may for example correspond to the transmitting and or receiving position or location. The data points may be collected by either an array of elements or a single moving element which receives data at points in time or the combination of both e.g. a physical array of elements with the elements moving over increments of time. The data collection may be sporadic or at specific intervals of time. As exemplified in data points are obtained using an array of receiving elements which receive data incrementally. The data points are arranged to form an aperture.

As used herein the term aperture means the information or data components used to form an image which may be for example an array of data points developed from a scanned area target or scene which can be used to form an image. As an example in the apertures depicted in each column represents an interval during which the 1 k elements receive data each data point representing the image data from the signal received combined with the coordinates of the receiving element.

As used herein and in the following claims the terminology aperture refers to the collection of K data records along the path or aperture of travel of the emitting radar or signal source. In general the aperture could be a line a curve a circle or any arbitrary shape. The receiving element k from the aperture is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . For bistatic radar the transmitting antenna is separate from the receiving antenna the transmitting element k from the aperture is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . For monostatic radar the transmitting antenna is the same as or co located with the receiving antenna the transmitting coordinates x k y k z k would be the same as the receiving coordinates x k y k z k . Since the monostatic radar case is a special case of the bistatic radar configuration the algorithm described here is applicable for both configurations. The returned radar signal at this receiving element k is s t . In order to form an image from the area of interest we form an imaging grid that consists of N image pixels. Each pixel Pfrom the imaging grid is located at coordinate x i y i z i . The imaging grid is usually defined as a 2 D rectangular shape. In general however the image grid could be arbitrary. For example a 3 D imaging grid would be formed for ground penetration radar to detect targets and structures buried underground. Another example is 3 D image of inside human body.

After the data points are established in an aperture or array as for example diagrammatically shown in a substantial portion of data points are removed from the original aperture array of data points to form a subarray or subapperture. Conversely the subarray or subaperture may be formed by the selection of data points within the original aperture.

The terminology singular value decomposition SVD as defined in Wikipedia means the factorization of a real or complex matrix. Formally the singular value decomposition of an m n real or complex matrix M is a factorization of the form where U is an m m real or complex unitary matrix is an m n rectangular diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal and V the conjugate transpose of V is an n n real or complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries of are known as the singular values of M. The m columns of U and the n columns of V are called the left singular vectors and right singular vectors of M respectively. The singular value decomposition and the eigendecomposition are closely related. Namely 1 The left singular vectors of Mare eigenvectors of 2 The right singular vectors of Mare eigenvectors of M M and 3 The non zero singular values of M found on the diagonal entries of J are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of both M M and M M . As an example suppose Suppose M is an m n matrix whose entries come from the field K which is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Then there exists a factorization of the form M U V . where U is an m m real or complex unitary matrix is an m n rectangular diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal zeroes otherwise and V the conjugate transpose of V is an n n real or complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries i i of are known as the singular values of M. The m columns of U and the n columns of V are called the left singular vectors and right singular vectors of M respectively.
