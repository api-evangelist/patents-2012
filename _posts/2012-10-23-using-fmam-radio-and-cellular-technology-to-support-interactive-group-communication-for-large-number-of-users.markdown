The present disclosure relates generally to communication and more specifically to techniques for supporting group communications on broadcast and multicast services in a cellular communication system.

A cellular communication system can support bi directional communication for multiple users by sharing the available system resources. Cellular systems are different from broadcast systems that can mainly or only support unidirectional transmission from broadcast stations to users. Cellular systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services and may be multiple access systems such as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA systems Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA systems Orthogonal FDMA OFDMA systems Single Carrier FDMA SC FDMA systems etc.

A cellular system may support broadcast multicast and unicast services. A broadcast service is a service that may be received by all users e.g. a news broadcast. A multicast service is a service that may be received by a group of users e.g. a subscription video service. A unicast service is a service intended for a specific user e.g. a voice call. Group communications can be implemented using unicast broadcast multicast or a combination of each.

The capacity of the unicast air interface is a limiting factor for interactive group communication for a large group of users in a mobile environment and or in a small geographical region such as a push to talk group call between a large number of users within a stadium. As the group becomes larger it is generally more efficient to use multicast services. Using multicast channels such as Broadcast and Multicast Service BCMCS or evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services eMBMS solves the problem of the limited air interface but requires a very expensive infrastructure and core network and as such may not be a practical solution for most operators. In addition to the air interface limitation the scalability of the group communication server is also a limiting factor for very large group call communication.

The disclosure is directed to conducting group communications. An embodiment receives information defining a group communication from a first network detects an availability of at least one local uni directional radio broadcast network outside the first network transmits an acknowledgment indicating an intention to connect to the at least one local uni directional radio broadcast network and monitors the group communication on the at least one local uni directional radio broadcast network.

Aspects of the various embodiments are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the various embodiments will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the various embodiments.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation. Further as used herein the term group communication push to talk or similar variations are meant to refer to a server arbitrated service between two or more devices.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the various embodiments. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

The techniques described herein may be used for various cellular communication systems such as CDMA TDMA FDMA OFDMA and SC FDMA systems. The terms system and network are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access UTRA cdma2000 etc. UTRA includes Wideband CDMA WCDMA and other variants of CDMA. cdma2000 covers IS 2000 IS 95 and IS 856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications GSM . An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA E UTRA Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB IEEE 802.11 Wi Fi IEEE 802.16 WiMAX IEEE 802.20 Flash OFDM etc. UTRA and E UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS . 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE is a release of UMTS that uses E UTRA which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC FDMA on the uplink UTRA E UTRA UMTS LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP . cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 . For clarity certain aspects of the techniques are described below for LTE and LTE terminology is used in much of the description below.

In the example shown in each Node B has three cells that cover different geographic areas. For simplicity shows the cells not overlapping one another. In a practical deployment adjacent cells typically overlap one another at the edges which may allow a UE to receive coverage from one or more cells at any location as the UE moves about the system.

UEs may be dispersed throughout the system and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as a mobile station a terminal an access terminal a subscriber unit a station etc. A UE may be a cellular phone a personal digital assistant PDA a wireless modem a wireless communication device a handheld device a laptop computer a cordless phone etc. A UE may communicate with a Node B via transmissions on the downlink and uplink. The downlink or forward link refers to the communication link from the Node B to the UE and the uplink or reverse link refers to the communication link from the UE to the Node B. In a solid line with double arrows indicates bi directional communication between a Node B and a UE. A dashed line with a single arrow indicates a UE receiving a downlink signal from a Node B e.g. for broadcast and or multicast services. The terms UE and user are used interchangeably herein.

Network controller may couple to multiple Node Bs to provide coordination and control for the Node Bs under its control and to route data for terminals served by these Node Bs. Cellular communication system may also include other network entities not shown in . Further as illustrated network controller may be operably coupled to an application server to provide group communication services to the various UEs through the cellular communication system . It will be appreciated that there can be many other network and system entities that can be used to facilitate communications between the UEs and servers and information outside of the access network. Accordingly the various embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to the specific arrangement or elements detailed in the various figures.

The system may support evolved multimedia broadcast multicast services eMBMS for multiple UEs as well as unicast services for individual UEs. A service for eMBMS may be referred to as an eMBMS service or flow and may be a broadcast service flow or a multicast service flow.

In LTE data and overhead information are processed as logical channels at a Radio Link Control RLC layer. The logical channels are mapped to transport channels at a Medium Access Control MAC layer. The transport channels are mapped to physical channels at a physical layer PHY . Table 1 lists some logical channels denoted as L transport channels denoted as T and physical channels denoted as P used in LTE and provides a short description for each channel.

As shown in Table 1 different types of overhead information may be sent on different channels. Table 2 lists some types of overhead information and provides a short description for each type. Table 2 also gives the channel s on which each type of overhead information may be sent in accordance with one design.

The different types of overhead information may also be referred to by other names. The scheduling and control information may be dynamic whereas the system and configuration information may be semi static.

The system may support multiple operational modes for eMBMS which may include a multi cell mode and a single cell mode. The multi cell mode may have the following characteristics 

In general eMBMS services may be supported with the multi cell mode the single cell mode and or other modes. The multi cell mode may be used for eMBMS multicast broadcast single frequency network MBSFN transmission which may allow a UE to combine signals received from multiple cells in order to improve reception performance.

As noted above eMBMS services can be used to distribute multicast data to groups and can be useful in group communication systems e.g. push to talk PTT calls . Conventional applications on eMBMS have a separate service announcement discovery mechanism. Further communications on pre established eMBMS flows are always on even on the air interface. Power saving optimization must be applied to put the UE to sleep when a call communication is not in progress. This is typically achieved by using out of band service announcements on unicast or multicast user plane data. Alternatively an application layer paging channel mechanism may be used. Since the application layer paging mechanism has to remain active it consumes bandwidth on the multicast sub frame which could be idle in the absence of the paging mechanism. Additionally since the multicast sub frame will be active while using the application layer paging the remainder of the resource blocks within the sub frame cannot be used for unicast traffic. Thus the total 5 Mhz bandwidth will be consumed for the sub frame for instances when application layer paging is scheduled without any other data.

To achieve low latency and reduce control signaling one eMBMS flow can be activated for each MBSFN. Depending on the data rate multiple multicast flows can be multiplexed on a single slot. PTT UEs targets can ignore and sleep between scheduled sub frames and reduce power consumption when no unicast data is scheduled for the UE. The MBSFN sub frame can be shared by groups in the same MBSFN service area. MAC layer signaling can be leveraged to wake up the application layer e.g. PTT application for the target UEs.

At eNode B a transmit processor may receive data for unicast services and data for broadcast and or multicast services from a data source e.g. directly or indirectly from application server . Transmit processor may process the data for each service to obtain data symbols. Transmit processor may also receive scheduling information configuration information control information system information and or other overhead information from a controller processor and or a scheduler . Transmit processor may process the received overhead information and provide overhead symbols. A transmit TX multiple input multiple output MIMO processor may multiplex the data and overhead symbols with pilot symbols process e.g. precode the multiplexed symbols and provide T output symbol streams to T modulators MOD through . Each modulator through may process a respective output symbol stream e.g. for OFDM to obtain an output sample stream. Each modulator may further process e.g. convert to analog amplify filter and upconvert the output sample stream to obtain a downlink signal. T downlink signals from modulators through may be transmitted via T antennas through respectively.

At UE antennas through may receive the downlink signals from eNode B and provide received signals to demodulators DEMOD through respectively. Each demodulator may condition e.g. filter amplify downconvert and digitize a respective received signal to obtain received samples and may further process the received samples e.g. for OFDM to obtain received symbols. A MIMO detector may receive and process the received symbols from all R demodulators through and provide detected symbols. A receive processor may process the detected symbols provide decoded data for UE and or desired services to a data sink and provide decoded overhead information to a controller processor . In general the processing by MIMO detector and receive processor is complementary to the processing by TX MIMO processor and transmit processor at eNode B .

On the uplink at UE data from a data source and overhead information from a controller processor may be processed by a transmit processor further processed by a TX MIMO processor if applicable conditioned by demodulators through and transmitted via antennas through . At eNode B the uplink signals from UE may be received by antennas conditioned by modulators detected by a MIMO detector and processed by a receive processor to obtain the data and overhead information transmitted by UE . A data source is coupled to the receive processor .

Controllers processors and may direct the operation at eNode B and UE respectively. Scheduler may schedule UEs for downlink and or uplink transmission schedule transmission of broadcast and multicast services and provide assignments of radio resources for the scheduled UEs and services. Controller processor and or scheduler may generate scheduling information and or other overhead information for the broadcast and multicast services.

Controller processor may implement processes for the techniques described herein. Memories and may store data and program codes for eNode B and UE respectively. In one embodiment a group communication application may operate in cooperation with the various processors and other components of the UE to receive group communications over a local uni directional radio broadcast network such as an FM AM channel. Accordingly group communications in the eMBMS environment can be accomplished in accordance with the various embodiments disclosed herein while still remaining compliant with the existing standards.

The capacity of the unicast air interface is a limiting factor for interactive group communication for a large group of users in a mobile environment and or in a small geographical region. Using multicast channels such as BCMCS or eMBMS solves the problem of the limited air interface but requires a very expensive infrastructure and core network and as such may not be a practical solution for many operators. In addition to the air interface limitation the scalability of the group communication server is also a limiting factor for very large group call communication.

The various embodiments use a cell phone s FM AM radio receiver to receive broadcast media for a large group call over FM AM radio channels rather than the cellular network. In that way enterprise customers can install less expensive FM AM transmitters for their large group communications needs rather than depending on an expensive broadcast multicast cellular network infrastructure.

The media to be broadcasted multicasted is forwarded to a newly defined network element analogous to a radio access network RAN or base transceiver station BTS or it could simply be another client that will receive the media stream and broadcast it over a specific FM AM radio frequency selected for the group. The operator may lease or buy the FM AM channel. The location and signal strength of this FM AM transmitter is such that it covers the local geographic area in which the large group is concentrated. For distributed large groups there can be multiple FM AM transmitters to cover each local cluster. Group members outside the range of the FM AM transmitter can participate in the group call over a unicast channel.

The FM AM channel can broadcast analog media or digital media. Analog voice over FM AM raises security issues since anyone tuning to that channel will be able to hear the broadcast. There are commercially available solutions for sending digital signals over FM AM however which has the advantage of enabling security for the broadcast.

Using digital communication over FM AM permits various forms of security mechanisms to be added to the group communication. Depending on the security requirements listening on the FM AM channel can be restricted or unrestricted. To restrict listening the digital signaling can be encrypted. The server can provide the encryption key to a member device in for example the acknowledgement it sends to a member device in response to that member s call join message.

In addition one FM AM channel transmitting digital signals can support multiple groups by multiplexing the multiple group communications on the one FM AM channel. Using more subcarriers it might be possible to support more than two simultaneous groups. Supporting multiple groups using one FM AM channel however depends on the capability of the FM AM receiver on each member device.

Each group is defined with an assigned FM AM channel the address of the FM AM transmitter the group member list and optionally the start and end or duration times of when the group communication will be active. The group call can be setup for a specific time as indicated by the start and end duration times or setup to begin immediately when a group member wishes to initiate a group call. Upon defining the group each member device is notified with the group information. The call server or a group database server may use out of band signaling to communicate the group information to the group members. The out of band signaling may be for example a short message service SMS message. The member device can extract the group information from the SMS message or the user can enter the information manually. The server can use a radio broadcast data system RBDS or FM digital signaling for call setup messages such as call announcements and in call signaling.

During the time of the group call each member device continuously monitors the FM AM channel. The group call will be always on for the determined time duration. Based on the time trigger the server will start the group call as in a chat room. For example for a group call among the employees at the headquarters of a large corporation a group call may be defined for all employees from 9 00 AM to 10 00 AM every Monday. Accordingly at 9 00 AM every Monday the server will activate the group call and each member device will tune to the FM AM channel.

When activating the group call the server activates the interface between itself and the FM AM transmitter. When a member wishes to speak he or she sends a Floor Request to the server over a unicast channel. The server controls the floor and forwards the media to the FM AM transmitter. The FM AM transmitter broadcasts the media on the FM AM channel. All the members will be able to hear if any group member speaks on the channel.

In an embodiment members can optionally send a join message to the server over a unicast radio channel. In this way the server can track how many members join the call and periodically send a status message e.g. as an SMS message to all of the group members indicating how many members have joined the call. Members outside of the FM AM coverage area can join the call over a unicast channel.

Referring to a UE here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include an FM AM receiver and a transceiver operably coupled to an ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only memory ROM random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of UE in are merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

At a group information database server transmits this group information to each member of the group using out of band signaling such as an SMS message. The group information database server may be the application server or a separate entity in communication with the application server . The group information database server does not need to use the FM AM channel to send the group information to the group members although it can.

At the application server activates the group call at the start time. Call activation does not require the application server to explicitly send signaling to the group members although it can. For example the application server can optionally send an out of band e.g. SMS or broadcasted call announcement to the group members. Rather to activate the group call the application server starts the call and activates the interface between the application server and the FM AM transmitter . From that time if any member tunes to the FM AM frequency that member will be able to hear the group call and send floor request messages over a unicast channel.

The application server can start the call based on the pre configured start time or any other trigger. For example the application server may start the call based on an out of band communication from an administrator portal.

At user A transmits an acknowledgment to the application server indicating that it is joining the group call as a multicast user. At user A transmits an acknowledgment to the application server indicating that it is joining the group call as a multicast user. At user A transmits an acknowledgment to the application server indicating that it is joining the group call as a unicast user. User A may join the call as a unicast user because user A is outside the FM AM coverage area or the UE does not have an FM AM receiver. The acknowledgments are transmitted on a unicast channel. At each multicast member device begins monitoring the FM AM channel.

For ease of illustration only shows exemplary users A A and A . As is apparent however any number of group members A to A may be multicast or unicast users and or have or not have FM AM receivers.

At user A requests and is granted the floor. User A transmits the floor request to the application server on a unicast channel. Likewise the application server transmits the floor grant to user A on a unicast channel. At user A transmits media such as a talk spurt to the application server on the unicast channel.

At the application server transmits the media to the address e.g. an Internet protocol IP address of the FM AM transmitter . The application server treats the FM AM transmitter as a group member and sends the media to the FM AM transmitter for all the group members except the unicast members such as user A

At the FM AM transmitter broadcasts the media on the FM AM channel. The media can be sent in analog format providing no security or as digital media over FM AM permitting security . At the application server transmits the media to the unicast users such as user A over a unicast channel.

At the application server broadcasts the group in call status to each group member. This information can also be transmitted as an SMS message. At the application server terminates the group call at the designated time after the designated duration at the instruction of the call originator or at the instruction of the group moderator. At the multicast group members stop monitoring the FM AM channel.

At UE determines whether the specified FM AM channel is available. This may include a determination of whether UE has an FM AM receiver and or whether the FM AM receiver can receive the specified FM AM channel. UE may not be able to receive the FM AM channel if for example UE is outside the coverage area of the FM AM channel.

If the specified FM AM channel is available then at UE transmits an acknowledgment to the application server indicating that it will be a multicast member of the group communication. At UE begins monitoring the FM AM channel. At UE receives group communication media such as a talk spurt over the FM AM channel.

At UE receives a group in call status from the application server . At UE detects the end of the group communication. This may be based on an explicit message from the application server or the detection of the call end time or the expiration of the specified call duration time. At UE stops monitoring the FM AM channel.

If the specified FM AM channel is not available then at UE transmits an acknowledgment indicating that it will be a unicast member of the group communication. At UE receives group communication media such as a talk spurt over the unicast channel. At UE receives a group in call status from the application server .

At the application server receives a floor request from a group member and transmits a floor grant to the member. At the application server receives group communication media from the member such as a talk spurt and forwards it to the FM AM transmitter and the unicast group members as appropriate based on the received acknowledgments.

At the application server transmits an in call status to the group members. At the application server detects the end of the group communication and deactivates it.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE eNode B FM AM transmitter etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G 3G FM AM etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. .

In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s .

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s .

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display . In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input .

The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

It will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the embodiments described below in more detail.

Further those of skill in the art will appreciate that the various illustrative logical blocks modules circuits and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware computer software or combinations of both.

Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.

The methods sequences and or algorithms described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware in a software module executed by a processor or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor such that the processor can read information from and write information to the storage medium. In the alternative the storage medium may be integral to the processor.

Accordingly an embodiment can include a computer readable media embodying a method for conducting group communications. Accordingly the invention is not limited to illustrated examples and any means for performing the functionality described herein are included in the various embodiments.
