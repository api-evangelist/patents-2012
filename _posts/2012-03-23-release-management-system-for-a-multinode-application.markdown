title: Release management system for a multi-node application
abstract: A deployment system provides the ability to deploy a multi-node distributed application, such as a cloud computing platform application that has a plurality of interconnected nodes performing specialized jobs. The deployment system includes a release management system that builds and manages versioned releases of application services and/or software modules that are executed by the plurality of nodes of the cloud computing platform application. The release management system utilizes specification files to define a jobs and application packages and configurations needed to perform the jobs. The jobs and application packages are assembled into a self-contained release bundle that may be provided to the deployment system. The deployment system unwraps the release bundle and provides each job to deployment agents executing on VMs. The deployment agents apply the jobs to their respective VM (e.g., launching applications), thereby deploying the cloud computing platform application.
