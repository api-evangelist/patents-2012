A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users. The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system.

In particular embodiments events logged by a social networking system such as login related issues restrictions of user actions in a social networking system and system errors may be reported out to users of the social networking system. Such events may logged by the social networking system from one or more client computing devices utilized by a user to access the social networking system. The user may receive indications of such events on one or more than one of their client computing devices. The event indications may include information regarding the event as well as an activateable reference e.g. link button or other user control to take an action in relation to the event such as requesting more information or resolving the event.

In particular embodiments an event may be associated with one or more users of a device or system. As an example any interaction involving a user may be considered an event. In particular embodiments an event may be associated with information about the one or more users contained in one or more accounts. As an example and not by way of limitation an event may be related to a login e.g. authentication and or authorization event. As an example and not by way of limitation an event may be related to a restriction of a user action taken with respect to a social networking system or a third party system. As an example and not by way of limitation an event may be related to a system error or a device error.

The user associated with smartphone may be a member of a social networking system in which the device user s profile connection information and content associations are maintained. The user may be represented by a user node in the social graph. Friends of the user may also be represented by user nodes in the social graph and connected to the user by edges in the social graph representing one or more degrees of separation. Content with which the user is associated may be represented by concept nodes in the social graph. Particular embodiments of the social graph are described in further detail in and related text in the specification.

In the example wireframes in menu bar allows the user to select events within a particular category Account Restrictions or Errors. Events may include an icon corresponding to the category an indication of the event a timestamp of the event and one or more buttons e.g. a hyperlink a button or any other input functionality that can be embodied in an activateable reference . Information area may display further information when a particular event is selected or when an a particular button is selected.

The example shown in illustrates example events shown under Restrictions which includes all events related to restrictions of the user s actions on the social networking system. In particular embodiments a restriction means that the social networking system is blocking the user from performing some particular user action. For example in the first event listing A event indication A states with respect to a user action Blocked for posting link to spam. The user has the option to select the two different buttons A the Challenge button which takes the user through an interface to explain or remediate their user action and the More Info button which provides a more detailed explanation of the restriction event. In another example in the second event listing A event indication A states with respect to a user action Blocked from friending Jane Smith. The user has selected the More Info button A for this event and a message providing an explanation of the restriction event is shown in information area You have been blocked from sending further friend requests to Jane Smith because Jane Smith has flagged your requests as spam and blocked any further requests. If you feel that there has been an error please feel free to contact our support specialists. 

The example shown in illustrates example events shown under Account which includes all events related to login issues. In particular embodiments a login issue includes at least a suspicious login attempt a request to reset a password a request to change a user ID used for authentication or a request to change a unique user identifier associated with the user. For example in the first event listing B event indication B states with respect to a user action Password reset requested. The user has the option to select the three different buttons B the Confirm button which confirms that it was the user who requested this user action the Disavow button which enables the user to disavow the user action and signal possible account hacking and or fraud and the More Info button B which will provide a more detailed explanation of the login issue event. In another example in the second event listing B event indication B states with respect to a user action Five failed login attempts detected. The user has selected the Confirm buttons B for both events and messages notifying the user that the login issue events have been resolved are shown in information area You have confirmed that the five failed login attempts at 10 11 a.m. on Mar. 14 2011 were by you. You have confirmed that the password reset request at 10 09 a.m. on Mar. 14 2011 was from you. 

The example shown in illustrates example events shown under Error which may include both system errors and device errors. These types of events may not be triggered by a user action. For example in the first event listing C event indication C states Device Error 21A. The user has the option to select the More Info button C which will provide a more detailed explanation of the error event. In another example in the second event listing C event indication C states System Error 597. The user has selected the More Info button C for the second event and an informational message notifying the user that the error event originated from a third party system i.e. the network service provider CellConnection is shown in information area More Information The CellConnection service does not provide 3G data services in this area.

The steps involved in producing the examples shown in are described in further detail in and related text in the specification.

In particular embodiments an event may be generated in relation to a login to a device system website application user interface or any other suitable access restricted content. In particular embodiments a login event may be an attempt by any entity to establish the appropriate credentials to access a device or restricted content. As an example an attempt to log in to a device such as a desktop computer or mobile phone may be recognized by one or more processors as an event. As another example an attempt to log in to an application or website such as a social networking website may be recognized by one or more processors as an event. As another example an attempt to log in to restricted functionality on a device website or application may be recognized by one or more processors as an event. For example access to functionality such as editing a document on a word processor or altering content on a filesystem may require a login to access the functionality. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method for logging in or accessing restricted content such as entering a password entering a username performing a gesture on a touch sensitive display biological detectors such as fingerprint or retinal scanners a near field communication system or any suitable combination thereof. A login event may include other login issues such as detection of a potentially fraudulent attempt to access a user account to reset a user s password to reassign the user account to a new username or to change a unique user identifier associated with the user. While this disclosure provides specific examples of events associated with one or more users access to restricted devices or content this disclosure contemplates as an event any suitable access to any suitable devices accounts or other restricted content.

In particular embodiments an event associated with one or more users may be a restriction of a user action taken with respect to functionality provided by a system device component or application. As an example and not by way of limitation a restriction may prevent a user from performing one or more actions a user is ordinarily capable of performing. In particular embodiments the social networking system may impose a restriction of a user action by reducing a level of authorization or permissions granted to a user. For example a user of a social networking website may be prevented from posting content such as photos for a specified duration or on a specified platform. As another example a user of a social networking website may be prevented from posting content or a URL link to content that is known to the social networking system to be spam or otherwise violate the guidelines or terms of service of the website. As another example a user of a social networking may be prevented from performing certain interactions with other users of a social networking website for example making friend requests to a particular user after a pre determined number of friend requests have been made in a pre determined time period or of a certain type of user of the social networking website. As another example a user of a device may be restricted from placing repeated telephone calls in a given timeframe to a given telephone number. In particular embodiments a restriction may limit a user s ability to access content ordinarily available to a user. For example a user of social networking website or application who has posted content determined to be offensive or in violation of terms or service on another user s profile or space on the social networking website may be temporarily or permanently barred from accessing the other user s content. In particular embodiments a restriction of a user action may comprise blocking another user s action. For example the user may have required that every posting on a group s profile is submitted for moderation prior to publication. While the above provides specific examples of events restricting access or functionality ordinarily available to one or more users this disclosure contemplates as an event any suitable restriction on the access or functionality available to a user of any suitable device system or social networking website. In addition removing a restriction or any expansion of one or more users access or functionality may also be considered an event. In particular embodiments restrictions of user actions may be further based upon user profile information interests connection relationship information a history of actions taken with respect to other nodes in the social graph content associated with the user or other social networking information. Social networking information may also include affinity information for the user according to one or more categories. Particular embodiments of social networking information are described in further detail in and related text in the specification.

In particular embodiments an event may be a system error or a device error. System errors may include unplanned system wide issues such as a server failure or network failure as well as planned events such as routine system wide maintenance procedures. System errors may also include issues accessing resources associated with the social networking system or associated with the client computing device. System errors may also include software bugs in the social networking system or on the client computing device. System errors may be related to the social networking system or a third party system such as for example a network service provider an application service provider or a content provider.

In step particular embodiments log the events. Events may be logged in association with information indicating where the event originated from a client computing device the social networking system or a third party system. If a user uses multiple client computing devices events may have originated on any of the client computing devices. Particular embodiments may store logged data in any conventional format or structure. Particular embodiments may analyze the events and log only summary or derivative information. Particular embodiments may only log events once a particular threshold has been attained e.g. only logging a suspicious login issue once five failed login attempts have been detected.

In step particular embodiments provide an indication for each event to a user upon receiving a request to view event indications. In particular embodiments after one or more processors have determined that an event has occurred one or more entities may be notified of the event. As an example a user of a social networking website may wish to be notified of restrictions placed on their account login attempts or other access events changes to the account or any other suitable events. An event indication may contain textual graphic or other information about the corresponding event. The event indication may provide the user with information regarding a requirement for confirmation a requirement for authorization a requirement for authentication a selectable option an opportunity to submit further user input a restriction a warning a security alert or a recommendation. The event indication may also be provided together with one or more activateable references e.g. link button checkbox radio button drop down listbox slider bar handle dial text entry box or other user control to take an action in relation to the event such as requesting more information or resolving the event. As shown in the example wireframes of the event indications may be organized for display in accordance with particular categories Account Restrictions or Errors.

Event indications may be stored on a device or network providing the user with access to previous event indications. In particular embodiments all event indications available to a user may be presented in a single accessible area. As an example a file or application may contain all event indications allowing a user to navigate among the event indications available to the user. In particular embodiments a service provider such as a provider of a wireless communications network associated with a system or device may wish to be notified of an event. As an example a customer service division of a cellular telephone service provider may wish to be notified that an event related to the service has occurred. As for the user event indications may be stored and accessible to the carrier at any time. In particular embodiments the information accompanying an event indication and its presentation may be the same for a service provider as they are for the user. In particular embodiments event indications accompanying information and their display may be different for a third party than they are for the user. For example the information delivered to a service provider may contain more technical information regarding an error and its cause than the information delivered to the user. The event indications may also be configured for display in accordance with display capabilities of the requesting device. For example on a small screen such as the smartphone style screen in only one particular category of event indications may be displayed at a time. In another example a tablet style computer may provide sufficient screen real estate to display all three categories of event indications at once. While the above provides specific examples of the types of entities that may wish to be notified of an event this disclosure contemplates any suitable entity being notified of any suitable event.

In particular embodiments event indications may be stored by or delivered to any suitable component of any suitable network. As an example a user may select one or more devices as delivery points for all event indications associated with the user. The event indications may be stored on the device and the user may select any suitable event indications to retain or discard. As another example event indications relating to a particular service provider or device may be delivered to the relevant division of the service provider or device manufacturer or retailer. As another example event indications may be delivered to particular account associated with a user for example a user s social networking profile. In this example event indications would be accessible through any device accessing the user s social networking profile. While this disclosure provides specific examples of the delivery points of event indications this disclosure contemplates any suitable delivery points for event indications including delivering event indications to any suitable combination of the delivery points described above.

An event indication may take any suitable form. In particular embodiments an event indication may be an audio cue such as a sound played through the speaker of a device. In particular embodiments an event indication may be a tactile cue such as a vibration of a device. In particular embodiments an event indication may be a visual cue. As an example an event indication may be an illumination of an LED. As another example an event indication may be a graphically generated icon or alphanumeric string displayed on a device. In particular embodiments an event indication may include or be accompanied by any suitable elements or information. As an example an event indication may include a message labeling or describing the event and the time of the event.

In step particular embodiments receive a user selection of an activatable reference for an event. The user selection may be entered by the user on a client computing device. The user selection may be entered by way of any input technique including but not limited to a swipe gesture a click on a link a click on an image entry of a valid password provision of valid biometric identification a voice command activation of a touch sensor of the device activation of a gyroscope of the device or activation of an accelerometer of the device. The user selection may signify that the user has dismissed the event indication requested more information regarding the event indication confirmed the event authorized the event disavowed the event submitted a question about the event challenged the event or resolved the event. Particular embodiments may update a user profile or a social graph associated with the social networking system with information associated with the user selection. For example when a user confirms that some user action that was initially flagged as potentially suspicious was indeed taken by the user access restrictions placed upon the user s profile may be lifted. In another example where the user authorizes publication of a user posting content on their profile an edge may be generated in a social graph in order to associate the posted content with the user s profile.

In step particular embodiments determine a control action for the event in response to the user selection. The control action may include one or more of several different actions such as for example sending additional information for the user updating the event indication configuring authorization settings for the user configuring account settings for the user configuring permissions for the user with respect to another user configuring permissions for the user with respect to particular functionality temporarily suspending the user s access to information or assessing a penalty for the user. For example updating the event indication may include updating an icon text or images associated with the event indication and may also include updating the corresponding activatable reference s to reflect a result of the control action. In another example configuring permissions for the user with respect to another user may comprise placing the user on a black list or grey list with respect to the other user. In another example configuring permissions for the user with respect to particular functionality may comprise preventing the user from playing a particular game or participating in a particular group function. In another example assessing a penalty for the user may comprise imposing a fine upon the user for violating particular rules or exceeding particular thresholds e.g. data transfer maximums .

The social networking system may receive event information from different sources such as client computing device or a third party server or it may receive event information generated internally within the social networking system itself. Social networking system may then log the event information . Depending upon the context social networking system may provide event indications to client computing device such as for example in the case where the user wishes to view event indications on their personal device. In another context social networking system may provide event indications to third party server such as for example in the case where a systems administrator customer service representative or sales person associated with the third party system requests access to event indications. In either context the person viewing the event indications may generate a user selection of an activatable reference for an event . Upon receiving the user selection social networking system determines a control action for the event in response to the user selection . In the context involving a third party system the control action may comprise sending information about the user selection of the user activatable reference to a third party system providing additional information received from the third party system to the user providing the user with contact information for an agent of the third party providing information to the third party system about a restriction of a user action or providing information to the third party system about a login issue.

Particular embodiments may provide an interface for third party systems to access the social networking system so that the social networking system can receive information associated with events provide information associated with events receive information associated with control actions or provide information in association with control actions. Such an interface may be based on any conventional inter process communication technology such as by way of example and without limitation an application programming interface API web services CORBA SOAP REST JSON DCOM or SAP RFC.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system .

A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application.
