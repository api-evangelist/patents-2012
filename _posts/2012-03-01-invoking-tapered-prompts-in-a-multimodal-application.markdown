This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 678 920 entitled INVOKING TAPERED PROMPTS IN A MULTIMODAL APPLICATION filed on Feb. 26 2007 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The field of the invention is data processing or more specifically methods apparatus and products for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application.

User interaction with applications running on small devices through a keyboard or stylus has become increasingly limited and cumbersome as those devices have become increasingly smaller. In particular small handheld devices like mobile phones and PDAs serve many functions and contain sufficient processing power to support user interaction through multimodal access that is by interaction in non voice modes as well as voice mode. Devices which support multimodal access combine multiple user input modes or channels in the same interaction allowing a user to interact with the applications on the device simultaneously through multiple input modes or channels. The methods of input include speech recognition keyboard touch screen stylus mouse handwriting and others. Multimodal input often makes using a small device easier.

Multimodal applications are often formed by sets of markup documents served up by web servers for display on multimodal browsers. A multimodal browser as the term is used in this specification generally means a web browser capable of receiving multimodal input and interacting with users with multimodal output where modes of the multimodal input and output include at least a speech mode. Multimodal browsers typically render web pages written in XHTML Voice X V . X V provides a markup language that enables users to interact with an multimodal application often running on a server through spoken dialog in addition to traditional means of input such as keyboard strokes and mouse pointer action. Visual markup tells a multimodal browser what the user interface is look like and how it is to behave when the user types points or clicks. Similarly voice markup tells a multimodal browser what to do when the user speaks to it. For visual markup the multimodal browser uses a graphics engine for voice markup the multimodal browser uses a speech engine. X V adds spoken interaction to standard web content by integrating XHTML eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language and speech recognition vocabularies supported by VoiceXML. For visual markup X V includes the XHTML standard. For voice markup X V includes a subset of VoiceXML. For synchronizing the VoiceXML elements with corresponding visual interface elements X V uses events. XHTML includes voice modules that support speech synthesis speech dialogs command and control and speech grammars. Voice handlers can be attached to XHTML elements and respond to specific events. Voice interaction features are integrated with XHTML and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.

In addition to X V multimodal applications also may be implemented with Speech Application Tags SALT . SALT is a markup language developed by the Salt Forum. Both X V and SALT are markup languages for creating applications that use voice input speech recognition and voice output speech synthesis. Both SALT applications and X V applications use underlying speech recognition and synthesis technologies or speech engines to do the work of recognizing and generating human speech. As markup languages both X V and SALT provide markup based programming environments for using speech engines in an application s user interface. Both languages have language elements markup tags that specify what the speech recognition engine should listen for and what the synthesis engine should say. Whereas X V combines XHTML VoiceXML and the XML Events standard to create multimodal applications SALT does not provide a standard visual markup language or eventing model. Rather it is a low level set of tags for specifying voice interaction that can be embedded into other environments. In addition to X V and SALT multimodal applications may be implemented in Java with a Java speech framework in C for example and with other technologies and in other environments as well.

Methods apparatus and computer program products are described for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application implemented with a multimodal browser and a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device supporting multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application the modes of user interaction including a voice mode and one or more non voice modes. Embodiments include identifying by a multimodal browser a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying by the multimodal browser one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element.

The foregoing and other objects features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.

Exemplary methods apparatus and products for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application are described with reference to the accompanying drawings beginning with . sets forth a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. Invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application in this example is implemented with a multimodal browser and a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device . The system of includes at least one speech recognition grammar that specifies words and phrases to be recognized by an automatic speech recognition ASR engine of a speech engine . The multimodal device supports multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application including a voice mode and one or more non voice modes of user interaction with the multimodal application. The voice mode is represented here with audio output of voice prompts and responses from the multimodal devices and audio input of speech for recognition from a user . Non voice modes are represented by input output devices such as keyboards and display screens on the multimodal devices . The multimodal application is operatively coupled to an ASR engine in a speech engine . The operative coupling may be implemented with an application programming interface API a voice service module or a VOIP connection as explained more detail below.

The system of operates generally to carry out invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to the present invention by identifying by a multimodal browser a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying by the multimodal browser one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element. Tapered prompts are prompts provided by a multimodal application that may change with each attempt on the part of a user to speak utterances that match a speech recognition grammar. Information requesting prompts may become terser under the assumption that the user is becoming more familiar with the task. Help messages may become more detailed under the assumption that the user needs more help. Or prompts can change just to make the interaction more interesting.

A multimodal device is an automated device that is automated computing machinery or a computer program running on an automated device that is capable of accepting from users more than one mode of input keyboard mouse stylus and so on including speech input and also displaying more than one mode of output graphic speech and so on. A multimodal device is generally capable of accepting speech input from a user digitizing the speech and providing digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. A multimodal device may be implemented for example as a voice enabled browser on a laptop a voice browser on a telephone handset an online game implemented with Java on a personal computer and with other combinations of hardware and software as may occur to those of skill in the art. Because multimodal applications may be implemented in markup languages X V SALT object oriented languages Java C procedural languages the C programming language and in other kinds of computer languages as may occur to those of skill in the art this specification uses the term multimodal application to refer to any software application server oriented or client oriented thin client or thick client that administers more than one mode of input and more than one mode of output typically including visual and speech modes.

Each of the example multimodal devices in the system of includes a microphone an audio amplifier a digital to analog converter and a multimodal application capable of accepting from a user speech for recognition digitizing the speech and providing the digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech may be digitized according to industry standard codecs including but not limited to those used for Distributed Speech Recognition as such. Methods for COding DECoding speech are referred to as codecs. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI provides several codecs for encoding speech for use in DSR including for example the ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front end Codec the ETSI ES 202 050 Advanced DSR Front end Codec the ETSI ES 202 211 Extended DSR Front end Codec and the ETSI ES 202 212 Extended Advanced DSR Front end Codec. In standards such as RFC3557 entitled

A multimodal application in this example provides speech for recognition and text for speech synthesis to a speech engine through a VoiceXML interpreter . A VoiceXML interpreter is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions from a multimodal application typically in the form of a VoiceXML element. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars data input elements event handlers and so on that advise the VoiceXML interpreter how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The VoiceXML interpreter administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm FIA .

A Form Interpretation Algorithm FIA drives the interaction between the user and a multimodal application. The FIA is generally responsible for selecting and playing one or more speech prompts collecting a user input either a response that fills in one or more input items or a throwing of some event and interpreting actions that pertained to the newly filled in input items. The FIA also handles multimodal application initialization grammar activation and deactivation entering and leaving forms with matching utterances and many other tasks.

The FIA also maintains an internal prompt counter that is increased with each attempt to provoke a response from a user. That is with each failed attempt to prompt a matching speech response from a user an internal prompt counter is incremented. The prompt counter is useful in invoking tapered prompts according to embodiments of the present invention.

As shown in a VoiceXML interpreter may be installed locally in the multimodal device itself or a VoiceXML interpreter may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device across a data communications network in a voice server . In a thick client architecture a multimodal device includes both its own speech engine and its own VoiceXML interpreter . The VoiceXML interpreter exposes an API to the multimodal application for use in providing speech recognition and speech synthesis for the multimodal application. The multimodal application provides dialog instructions VoiceXML elements grammars input elements event handlers and so on through the API to the VoiceXML interpreter and the VoiceXML interpreter administers the speech engine on behalf of the multimodal application. In the thick client architecture VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on the multimodal device. In the thin client architecture VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on a voice server located remotely across a data communications network from the multimodal device running the multimodal application .

The VoiceXML interpreter provides grammars speech for recognition and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine and the VoiceXML interpreter returns to the multimodal application speech engine output in the form of recognized speech semantic interpretation results and digitized speech for voice prompts. In a thin client architecture the VoiceXML interpreter is located remotely from the multimodal client device in a voice server the API for the VoiceXML interpreter is still implemented in the multimodal device with the API modified to communicate voice dialog instructions speech for recognition and text and voice prompts to and from the VoiceXML interpreter on the voice server. For ease of explanation only one of the multimodal devices in the system of is shown with a VoiceXML interpreter but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a VoiceXML interpreter according to embodiments of the present invention. Each of the example multimodal devices in the system of may be configured to carry out invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application by installing and running on the multimodal device a multimodal browser that carries out invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention.

The use of these four example multimodal devices is for explanation only not for limitation of the invention. Any automated computing machinery capable of accepting speech from a user providing the speech digitized to an ASR engine through a VoiceXML interpreter and receiving and playing speech prompts and responses from the VoiceXML interpreter may be improved to function as a multimodal device for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention.

The system of also includes a voice server which is connected to data communications network through wireline connection . The voice server is a computer that runs a speech engine that provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning text representing recognized speech. Voice server also provides speech synthesis text to speech TTS conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as for example X V applications SALT applications or Java voice applications.

The system of includes a data communications network that connects the multimodal devices and the voice server for data communications. A data communications network useful for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention is a data communications network composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such a data communications network may be implemented with optical connections wireline connections or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets internets local area data communications networks LANs and wide area data communications networks WANs . Such a data communications network may implement for example 

The system of includes a web server connected for data communications through wireline connection to network and therefore to the multimodal devices . The web server may be any server that provides to client devices markup documents that compose multimodal applications. The web server typically provides such markup documents via a data communications protocol HTTP HDTP WAP or the like. That is although the term web is used to described the web server generally in this specification there is no limitation of data communications between multimodal devices and the web server to HTTP alone. The markup documents also may be implemented in any markup language that supports non speech display elements data entry elements and speech elements for identifying which speech to recognize and which words to speak grammars form elements and the like including for example X V and SALT. A multimodal application in a multimodal device then upon receiving from the web sever a markup document as part of a multimodal application may execute speech elements by use of a VoiceXML interpreter and speech engine in the multimodal device itself or by use of a VoiceXML interpreter and speech engine located remotely from the multimodal device in a voice server .

The arrangement of the multimodal devices the web server the voice server and the data communications network making up the exemplary system illustrated in are for explanation not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to various embodiments of the present invention may include additional servers routers other devices and peer to peer architectures not shown in as will occur to those of skill in the art. Data communications networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .

Invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention in a thin client architecture may be implemented with one or more voice servers computers that is automated computing machinery that provide speech recognition and speech synthesis. For further explanation therefore sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a voice server for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application for multimodal applications according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server of includes at least one computer processor or CPU as well as random access memory RAM which is connected through a high speed memory bus and bus adapter to processor and to other components of the voice server.

Stored in RAM is a voice server application a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured for use in invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. Voice server application provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning speech recognition results including text representing recognized speech text for use as variable values in dialogs and text as string representations of scripts for semantic interpretation. Voice server application also includes computer program instructions that provide text to speech TTS conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as for example X V applications SALT applications or Java Speech applications.

Voice server application may be implemented as a web server implemented in Java C or another language that supports X V SALT VoiceXML or other multimodal languages by providing responses to HTTP requests from X V clients SALT clients Java Speech clients or other multimodal clients. Voice server application may for a further example be implemented as a Java server that runs on a Java Virtual Machine and supports a Java voice framework by providing responses to HTTP requests from Java client applications running on multimodal devices. And voice server applications that support embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention.

The voice server in this example includes a speech engine . The speech engine is a functional module typically a software module although it may include specialized hardware also that does the work of recognizing and generating human speech. The speech engine includes an automated speech recognition ASR engine for speech recognition and a text to speech TTS engine for generating speech. The speech engine also includes a grammar a lexicon and a language specific acoustic model . The language specific acoustic model is a data structure a table or database for example that associates SFVs with phonemes representing to the extent that it is practically feasible to do so all pronunciations of all the words in a human language. The lexicon is an association of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of each word the lexicon effectively identifies words that are capable of recognition by an ASR engine. Also stored in RAM is a Text To Speech TTS Engine a module of computer program instructions that accepts text as input and returns the same text in the form of digitally encoded speech for use in providing speech as prompts for and responses to users of multimodal systems.

The grammar communicates to the ASR engine the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. For precise understanding distinguish the purpose of the grammar and the purpose of the lexicon. The lexicon associates with phonemes all the words that the ASR engine can recognize. The grammar communicates the words currently eligible for recognition. The set of words currently eligible for recognition and the set of words capable of recognition may or may not be the same.

Grammars for use in invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention may be expressed in any format supported by any ASR engine including for example the Java Speech Grammar Format JSGF the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification SRGS the Augmented Backus Naur Format ABNF from the IETF s RFC2234 in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C s Stochastic Language Models N Gram Specification and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs such as for example a VoiceXML or an X V . A grammar s definition may be expressed in line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG 

In this example the elements named and are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rulename and an expansion of a rule that advises an ASR engine or a voice interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In this example expansion includes conjunction and disjunction and the vertical bars mean or. An ASR engine or a voice interpreter processes the rules in sequence first then then . The rule accepts for recognition call or phone or telephone plus that is in conjunction with whatever is returned from the rule and the rule. The rule accepts bob or martha or joe or pete or chris or john or artoush and the rule accepts today or this afternoon or tomorrow or next week. The command grammar as a whole matches utterances like these for example 

The voice server application in this example is configured to receive from a multimodal client located remotely across a network from the voice server digitized speech for recognition from a user and pass the speech along to the ASR engine for recognition. ASR engine is a module of computer program instructions also stored in RAM in this example. In carrying out automated speech recognition the ASR engine receives speech for recognition in the form of at least one digitized word and uses frequency components of the digitized word to derive a Speech Feature Vector SFV . An SFV may be defined for example by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech. The ASR engine can use the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language specific acoustic model . The ASR engine then uses the phonemes to find the word in the lexicon .

Also stored in RAM is a VoiceXML interpreter a module of computer program instructions that processes VoiceXML grammars. VoiceXML input to VoiceXML interpreter may originate for example from VoiceXML clients running remotely on multimodal devices from X V clients running remotely on multimodal devices from SALT clients running on multimodal devices or from Java client applications running remotely on multimedia devices. In this example VoiceXML interpreter interprets and executes VoiceXML segments representing voice dialog instructions received from remote multimedia devices and provided to VoiceXML interpreter through voice server application .

A multimodal application in a thin client architecture may provide voice dialog instructions VoiceXML segments VoiceXML elements and the like to VoiceXML interpreter through data communications across a network with multimodal application . The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars data input elements event handlers and so on that advise the VoiceXML interpreter how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The VoiceXML interpreter administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm FIA . The VoiceXML interpreter interprets VoiceXML dialogs provided to the VoiceXML interpreter by a multimodal application.

As mentioned above a Form Interpretation Algorithm FIA drives the interaction between the user and a multimodal application. The FIA is generally responsible for selecting and playing one or more speech prompts collecting a user input either a response that fills in one or more input items or a throwing of some event and interpreting actions that pertained to the newly filled in input items. The FIA also handles multimodal application initialization grammar activation and deactivation entering and leaving forms with matching utterances and many other tasks.

The FIA also maintains an internal prompt counter that is increased with each attempt to provoke a response from a user. That is with each failed attempt to prompt a matching speech response from a user an internal prompt counter is incremented. The prompt counter is useful in invoking tapered prompts according to embodiments of the present invention.

Also stored in RAM is an operating system . Operating systems useful in voice servers according to embodiments of the present invention include UNIX Linux Microsoft NT AIX IBM s i5 OS and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Operating system voice server application VoiceXML interpreter ASR engine JVM and TTS Engine in the example of are shown in RAM but many components of such software typically are stored in non volatile memory also for example on a disk drive .

Voice server of includes bus adapter a computer hardware component that contains drive electronics for high speed buses the front side bus the video bus and the memory bus as well as drive electronics for the slower expansion bus . Examples of bus adapters useful in voice servers according to embodiments of the present invention include the Intel Northbridge the Intel Memory Controller Hub the Intel Southbridge and the Intel I O Controller Hub. Examples of expansion buses useful in voice servers according to embodiments of the present invention include Industry Standard Architecture ISA buses and Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI buses.

Voice server of includes disk drive adapter coupled through expansion bus and bus adapter to processor and other components of the voice server . Disk drive adapter connects non volatile data storage to the voice server in the form of disk drive . Disk drive adapters useful in voice servers include Integrated Drive Electronics IDE adapters Small Computer System Interface SCSI adapters and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. In addition non volatile computer memory may be implemented for a voice server as an optical disk drive electrically erasable programmable read only memory so called EEPROM or Flash memory RAM drives and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art.

The example voice server of includes one or more input output I O adapters . I O adapters in voice servers implement user oriented input output through for example software drivers and computer hardware for controlling output to display devices such as computer display screens as well as user input from user input devices such as keyboards and mice. The example voice server of includes a video adapter which is an example of an I O adapter specially designed for graphic output to a display device such as a display screen or computer monitor. Video adapter is connected to processor through a high speed video bus bus adapter and the front side bus which is also a high speed bus.

The exemplary voice server of includes a communications adapter for data communications with other computers and for data communications with a data communications network . Such data communications may be carried out serially through RS 232 connections through external buses such as a Universal Serial Bus USB through data communications data communications networks such as IP data communications networks and in other ways as will occur to those of skill in the art. Communications adapters implement the hardware level of data communications through which one computer sends data communications to another computer directly or through a data communications network. Examples of communications adapters useful according to embodiments of the present invention include modems for wired dial up communications Ethernet IEEE 802.3 adapters for wired data communications network communications and 802.11 adapters for wireless data communications network communications.

For further explanation sets forth a functional block diagram of exemplary apparatus for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application in a thin client architecture according to embodiments of the present invention. The example of includes a multimodal device and a voice server connected for data communication by a VOIP connection through a data communications network . A multimodal application runs on the multimodal device and a voice server application runs on the voice server . The multimodal client application may be a set or sequence of X V or SALT documents that execute on multimodal browser a Java voice application that executes on the Java Virtual Machine or a multimodal application implemented in other technologies as may occur to those of skill in the art. The example multimodal device of also includes a sound card which is an example of an I O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec .

In addition to the multimodal sever application the voice server also has installed upon it a speech engine with an ASR engine a grammar a lexicon a language specific acoustic model and a TTS engine as well as a JVM and a Voice XML interpreter . VoiceXML interpreter interprets and executes VoiceXML dialog instructions received from the multimodal application and provided to VoiceXML interpreter through voice server application . VoiceXML input to VoiceXML interpreter may originate from the multimodal application implemented as an X V client running remotely on the multimodal device . As noted above the multimedia device application also may be implemented as a Java client application running remotely on the multimedia device a SALT application running remotely on the multimedia device and in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art.

VOIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol a generic term for routing speech over an IP based data communications network. The speech data flows over a general purpose packet switched data communications network instead of traditional dedicated circuit switched voice transmission lines. Protocols used to carry voice signals over the IP data communications network are commonly referred to as Voice over IP or VOIP protocols. VOIP traffic may be deployed on any IP data communications network including data communications networks lacking a connection to the rest of the Internet for instance on a private building wide local area data communications network or LAN. 

Many protocols are used to effect VOIP. The two most popular types of VOIP are effected with the IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP and the ITU s protocol known as H.323. SIP clients use TCP and UDP port 5060 to connect to SIP servers. SIP itself is used to set up and tear down calls for speech transmission. VOIP with SIP then uses RTP for transmitting the actual encoded speech. Similarly H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the standards branch of the International Telecommunications Union that defines protocols to provide audio visual communication sessions on any packet data communications network.

The apparatus of operates in a manner that is similar to the operation of the system of described above. Multimodal application is a user level multimodal client side computer program that presents a voice interface to user provides audio prompts and responses and accepts input speech for recognition . Multimodal application provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone and have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier and a coder decoder codec of a sound card and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine . Multimodal application then packages the digitized speech in a recognition request message according to a VOIP protocol and transmits the speech to voice server through the VOIP connection on the network .

Voice server application provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting dialog instructions VoiceXML segments and returning speech recognition results including text representing recognized speech text for use as variable values in dialogs and output from execution of semantic interpretation scripts as well as voice prompts. Voice server application includes computer program instructions that provide text to speech TTS conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as for example X V applications SALT applications or Java Speech applications.

The voice server application receives speech for recognition from a user and passes the speech through API calls to VoiceXML interpreter which in turn uses an ASR engine for speech recognition. The ASR engine receives digitized speech for recognition uses frequency components of the digitized speech to derive an SFV uses the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language specific acoustic model and uses the phonemes to find the speech in the lexicon . The ASR engine then compares speech found as words in the lexicon to words in a grammar to determine whether words or phrases in speech are recognized by the ASR engine.

The multimodal application is operatively coupled to the ASR engine . In this example the operative coupling between the multimodal application and the ASR engine is implemented with a VOIP connection through a voice services module then through the voice server application and either JVM VoiceXML interpreter or SALT interpreter depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X V Java or SALT. The voice services module is a thin layer of functionality a module of computer program instructions that presents an API for use by an application level program in providing dialog instructions and speech for recognition to a voice server application and receiving in response voice prompts and other responses. In this example application level programs are represented by multimodal application JVM and multimodal browser .

The voice services module provides data communications services through the VOIP connection and the voice server application between the multimodal device and the VoiceXML interpreter The API is the same API presented to applications by a VoiceXML interpreter when the VoiceXML interpreter is installed on the multimodal device in a thick client architecture on . So from the point of view of an application calling the API the application is calling the VoiceXML interpreter directly. The data communications functions of the voice services module are transparent to applications that call the API . At the application level calls to the API may be issued from the multimodal browser which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application when the multimodal application is implemented with X V. And calls to the API may be issued from the JVM which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application when the multimodal application is implemented with Java.

The multimodal browser of operates generally to carry out invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to the present invention by identifying a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element.

Invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention in thick client architectures is generally implemented with multimodal devices that is automated computing machinery or computers. In the system of for example all the multimodal devices are implemented to some extent at least as computers. For further explanation therefore sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a multimodal device for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application applications according to embodiments of the present invention. In a multimodal device implementing a thick client architecture as illustrated in the multimodal device has no connection to a remote voice server containing a VoiceXML interpreter and a speech engine. All the components needed for speech synthesis and voice recognition according to embodiments of the present invention are installed or embedded in the multimodal device itself.

The example multimodal device of includes several components that are structured and operate similarly as do parallel components of the voice server having the same drawing reference numbers as described above with reference to at least one computer processor frontside bus RAM high speed memory bus bus adapter video adapter video bus expansion bus communications adapter I O adapter disk drive adapter an operating system a JVM a VoiceXML Interpreter a speech engine and so on. As in the system of the speech engine in the multimodal device of includes an ASR engine a grammar a lexicon a language dependent acoustic model and a TTS engine . The VoiceXML interpreter administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm FIA .

The speech engine in this kind of embodiment a thick client architecture often is implemented as an embedded module in a small form factor device such as a handheld device a mobile phone PDA and the like. An example of an embedded speech engine useful according to embodiments of the present invention is IBM s Embedded ViaVoice Enterprise. The example multimodal device of also includes a sound card which is an example of an I O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec . The sound card is connected to processor through expansion bus bus adapter and front side bus .

Also stored in RAM in this example is a multimodal application a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a multimodal device as an apparatus that supports embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application implements speech recognition by accepting speech for recognition from a user and sending the speech for recognition through API calls to the ASR engine . The multimodal application implements speech synthesis generally by sending words to be used as prompts for a user to the TTS engine . As an example of thick client architecture the multimodal application in this example does not send speech for recognition across a network to a voice server for recognition and the multimodal application in this example does not receive synthesized speech TTS prompts and responses across a network from a voice server. All grammar processing voice recognition and text to speech conversion in this example is performed in an embedded fashion in the multimodal device itself.

More particularly multimodal application in this example is a user level multimodal client side computer program that provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier and a coder decoder codec of a sound card and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine . The multimodal application may be implemented as a set or sequence of X V documents executing in a multimodal browser or microbrowser that passes VoiceXML grammars and digitized speech by calls through an API directly to an embedded VoiceXML interpreter for processing. The embedded VoiceXML interpreter may in turn issue requests for speech recognition through API calls directly to the embedded ASR engine . Multimodal application also can provide speech synthesis TTS conversion by API calls to the embedded TTS engine for voice prompts and voice responses to user input.

In a further class of exemplary embodiments the multimodal application may be implemented as a Java voice application that executes on Java Virtual Machine and issues calls through the VoiceXML API for speech recognition and speech synthesis services. In further exemplary embodiments the multimodal application may be implemented as a set or sequence of SALT documents executed on a multimodal browser or microbrowser that issues calls through the VoiceXML API for speech recognition and speech synthesis services. In addition to X V SALT and Java implementations multimodal application may be implemented in other technologies as will occur to those of skill in the art and all such implementations are well within the scope of the present invention.

The multimodal application is operatively coupled to the ASR engine . In this example the operative coupling between the multimodal application and the ASR engine is implemented either JVM VoiceXML interpreter or SALT interpreter depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X V Java or SALT. When the multimodal application is implemented in X V the operative coupling is effected through the multimodal browser which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X V application and then through the VoiceXML interpreter which passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine. When the multimodal application is implemented in Java Speech the operative coupling is effected through the JVM which provides an operating environment for the Java application and passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine. When the multimodal application is implemented in SALT the operative coupling is effected through the SALT interpreter which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X V application and passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine.

The multimodal application in this example running on a multimodal device that contains its own VoiceXML interpreter and its own speech engine with no network or VOIP connection to a remote voice server containing a remote VoiceXML interpreter or a remote speech engine is an example of a so called thick client architecture so called because all of the functionality for processing voice mode interactions between a user and the multimodal application is implemented on the multimodal device itself.

The multimodal browser of operates generally to carry out invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application according to the present invention by identifying a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element.

For further explanation sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application. As mentioned above tapered prompts are prompts provided by a multimodal application that may change with each attempt on the part of a user to speak utterances that match a speech recognition grammar. Information requesting prompts may become terser under the assumption that the user is becoming more familiar with the task. Help messages may become more detailed under the assumption that the user needs more help. Or prompts can change just to make the interaction more interesting.

The method of is implemented with a multimodal browser and a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device supporting multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application including a voice mode and one or more non voice modes. The voice mode is represented in this example with audio output through a speaker and audio input through a microphone . Non voice modes are represented by user input devices not shown such as a keyboard and a mouse. In the example of the multimodal browser supports tapered prompts according to the present invention.

The method of includes identifying by a multimodal browser a prompt element in a multimodal application . A prompt element may be implemented as a markup element in a multimodal application such as for example a element in an X V document.

The method of also includes identifying by the multimodal browser one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element . The one or more attributes associated with the prompt element may include a class attribute and in such embodiments playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element may be carried out by identifying a cascading style sheet defined by the class attribute playing according to the cascading style sheet a speech prompt and rendering according to the cascading style sheet one or more visual elements associated with the speech prompt as described below with reference to .

In other embodiments for example the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element may include a prompt counter shadow variable and a source expression attribute for a form item whose value depends upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable . In such embodiments playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element may be carried out by playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute as described below with reference to .

As mentioned above in some embodiments of the present invention the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element include a class attribute . For further explanation therefore sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application that makes use of class attributes associated with a prompt element. The method of is similar to the method of in that the method of includes identifying by a multimodal browser a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying by the multimodal browser one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element .

In the method of the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element include a class attribute and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element includes identifying a cascading style sheet defined by the class attribute playing according to the cascading style sheet a speech prompt and rendering according to the cascading style sheet one or more visual elements associated with the speech prompt .

The identified cascading style sheet defined by the class attribute defines the manner in which the speech prompt is played and the visual element is rendered. The cascading style sheet that is identified therefore is different upon each attempt to prompt the user thereby implementing a tapered prompt. Consider the following example 

In the example above four prompt elements each have an associated class attribute that identifies a particular cascading style sheet. For example the first prompt element has an associated class attribute first try identifying a cascading style sheet first try font family small voice family female voice volume soft instructing the speech prompt to be played in the voice of a female at a soft volume. The cascading style sheet identified by the class attribute first try also instructs the rendering of a visual element associated with the prompt to be rendered in small font. Similarly the prompt element has an associated class attribute second try identifying a cascading style sheet that instructs the speech prompt to be played in medium volume and the visual element to be rendered in a medium font. The prompt element has an associated class attribute third try that identifies a cascading style sheet that instructs the speech prompt to be played with a louder volume in the voice of a male manager and the visual element associated with the speech prompt to be rendered in a large font. The fourth prompt element has an associated class attribute that identifies a cascading style sheet instructing the speech prompt to be played with at an even louder volume and the visual element associated with the speech prompt to be rendered in a bolder font.

As mentioned above the FIA maintains an internal prompt counter that is increased with each attempt to provoke a response from a user. That is with each failed attempt to prompt a matching speech response from a user an internal prompt counter is incremented. In the example above as the prompt counter of the FIA is increased with each attempt to provoke a matching response from a user the speech prompts played to the user are tapered from a soft voiced female to the loud voice of a male manager and the visual elements associated with the speech prompts are tapered from a small font to a large bold font.

As mentioned above in some embodiments of the present invention the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element include a prompt counter shadow variable and a source expression attribute for a form item whose value depends upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable. For further explanation sets forth a flow chart illustrating another exemplary method for invoking tapered prompts in a multimodal application that makes use of these attributes. The method of is similar to the methods of and in that the method of includes identifying by a multimodal browser a prompt element in a multimodal application identifying by the multimodal browser one or more attributes associated with the prompt element and playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element .

In the method of the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element include a prompt counter shadow variable and a source expression attribute for a form item whose value depends upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable . As mentioned above the FIA maintains an internal prompt counter. A prompt counter shadow variable is a variable whose value is the same as the internal prompt counter maintained by the FIA. Such a prompt counter shadow variable empowers multimodal application authors to make more controlled use of the internal prompt counter of the FIA.

The source expression attribute includes script for identifying a predefined prompt or invoking an engine to dynamically create a prompt in dependence upon the current value of the prompt counter shadow variable. The value of source expression attribute depends upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable in that the prompt identified or created depends upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable.

Playing a speech prompt according to the one or more attributes associated with the prompt element according to the method of includes playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute . Playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute may include playing the predetermined speech prompt dynamically creating by the remote prompt creation engine a speech prompt in dependence upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable or dynamically creating a speech prompt by invoking the local function call parameterized with the value of the prompt counter shadow variable as discussed below.

Consider a first example in which the value of the source expression attribute is implemented as a local URL defined by the value of the prompt counter shadow variable and the local URL identifies a predetermined speech prompt for the prompt counter value. In the example below playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute may be carried out by playing the predetermined speech prompt.

In the example above the prompt element has an associated source expression attribute srcexpr p. drink .prompt.count that identifies a predetermined prompt at a local URL in dependence upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable prompt.count e. In the example above when the prompt counter shadow variable is 1 the identified prompt is What kind of drink would you like . When the prompt counter shadow variable is 2 the identified prompt is Would you like coffee tea or milk When the prompt counter shadow variable is 3 the identified prompt is Please say coffee tea or milk .

In the example above as the value of the prompt counter shadow variable is increased the predetermined prompts are tapered from What kind of drink would you like to Would you like coffee tea or milk to Please say coffee tea or milk. With each increment of the prompt counter shadow variable the prompts taper to a more specific prompt to facilitate eliciting a matching response from the user.

In another example the value of the source expression attribute of may be implemented as a data encoded URL for invoking a remote prompt creation engine and wherein the URL is data encoded with the value of the prompt counter shadow variable. In such cases playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute may be carried out by dynamically creating by the remote prompt creation engine a speech prompt in dependence upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable. Consider for example the following prompt element 

In the example above the source expression attribute srcexpr http www.drink.com prompt.jsp count drink .prompt.count associated with the prompt element implements script that invokes a remote prompt creation engine through the URL http www.drink.com prompt.jsp count drink .prompt.count having data encoding of the value of the prompt counter shadow variable prompt.count. The remote prompt creation engine returns a prompt created in dependence upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable.

In another example the value of the source expression attribute of may also be implemented as a local URL for invoking a local function call. In such cases playing a speech prompt defined by the value of the source expression attribute may be carried out by dynamically creating a speech prompt by invoking the local function call parameterized with the value of the prompt counter shadow variable. Consider for example the following prompt element 

In the example above the source expression attribute srcexpr createPrompt drink .prompt.count associated with the prompt element implements a local function call parameterized with the value of the prompt counter shadow variable prompt.count . The local function call returns a prompt dynamically created in dependence upon the value of the prompt counter shadow variable.
