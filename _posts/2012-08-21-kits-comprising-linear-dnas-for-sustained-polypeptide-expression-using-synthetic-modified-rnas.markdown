The ability to change the phenotype of a cell or cells either to express a desired protein or to change the differentiated phenotype of the cell to that of another desired cell type has applications in both research and therapeutic settings. The phenotype of a cell is most commonly modified by expression of protein s from exogenous DNA or from recombinant viral vectors. These approaches have the potential for unintended mutagenic effects.

One area of interest is the modification of cellular differentiation such that cells are directed to different developmental lineages. As one example generating insulin producing pancreatic cells from acinar pancreatic cells or other somatic cell types has the potential to treat diabetes. As but one other example the ability to redifferentiate a tumor cell or tumor stem cell to a non cancerous cell type can provide a therapy for cancer. Current protocols for altering cell fate tend to focus on the expression of factors such as differentiation factors dedifferentiation factors transdifferentiation factors and reprogramming factors using viral or DNA mediated expression.

An area of recent focus is the production of pluripotent or multipotent stem cells from non embryonic sources. Induction of pluripotency was originally achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues using retroviral vectors to enforce expression of four transcription factors KLF4 c MYC OCT4 and SOX2 KMOS Takahashi K. and S. Yamanaka 2006. 126 4 p. 663 76 Takahashi K. et al. 2007. 131 5 p. 861 72 . Attempts to derive induced pluripotent stem iPS cells have also been made using excisable lentiviral and transposon vectors or through repeated application of transient plasmid episomal and adenovirus vectors Chang C. W. et al. 2009. 27 5 p. 1042 1049 Kaji K. et al. 2009. 458 7239 p. 771 5 Okita K. et al. 2008. 322 5903 p. 949 53 Stadtfeld M. et al. 2008. 322 5903 p. 945 9 Woltjen K. et al. 2009 Yu J. et al. 2009 p. 1172482 Fusaki N. et al. 2009. 85 8 p. 348 62 . Human pluripotent cells have also been derived using two DNA free methods serial protein transduction with recombinant proteins incorporating cell penetrating peptide moieties Kim D. et al. 2009. 4 6 p. 472 476 Zhou H. et al. 2009. 4 5 p. 381 4 and infectious transgene delivery using the Sendai virus which has a completely RNA based reproductive cycle Fusaki N. et al. 2009. 85 8 p. 348 62 .

Provided herein are compositions methods and kits for changing the phenotype of a cell or cells. These methods compositions and kits can be used either to express a desired protein in a cell or tissue or to change the differentiated phenotype of a cell to that of another desired cell type. Significantly the methods compositions and kits described herein do not utilize exogenous DNA or viral vector based methods for the expression of protein s and thus do not cause permanent modification of the genome or have the potential for unintended mutagenic effects.

The compositions methods and kits described herein are based upon the direct introduction of synthetic RNAs into a cell which when translated provide a desired protein or proteins. Higher eukaryotic cells have evolved cellular defenses against foreign non self RNA that ultimately result in the global inhibition of cellular protein synthesis resulting in cellular toxicity. This response involves in part the production of Type I or Type II interferons and is generally referred to as the interferon response or the cellular innate immune response. The cellular defenses normally recognize synthetic RNAs as foreign and induce this cellular innate immune response. The inventors have recognized that the ability to achieve sustained or repeated expression of an exogenously directed protein using synthetic RNA is hampered by the induction of this innate immune response. In the methods described herein the effect of the cellular innate immune response is mitigated by using synthetic RNAs that are modified in a manner that avoids or reduces the response. Avoidance or reduction of the innate immune response permit sustained expression from exogenously introduced RNA necessary for example to modify the developmental phenotype of a cell. In one aspect sustained expression is achieved by repeated introduction of synthetic modified RNAs into a target cell or its progeny.

The modified synthetic RNAs described herein in one aspect can be introduced to a cell in order to induce exogenous expression of a protein of interest in a cell. The ability to direct exogenous expression of a protein of interest using the modified synthetic RNAs described herein is useful for example in the treatment of disorders caused by an endogenous genetic defect in a cell or organism that impairs or prevents the ability of that cell or organism to produce the protein of interest. Accordingly in some embodiments compositions and methods comprising the modified synthetic RNAs described herein can be used for the purposes of gene therapy.

The modified synthetic RNAs described herein can advantageously be used in the alteration of cellular fates and or developmental potential. The ability to express a protein from an exogenous RNA permits both the alteration or reversal of the developmental potential of a cell i.e. the reprogramming of the cell and the directed differentiation of a cell to a more differentiated phenotype. A critical aspect in altering the developmental potential of a cell is the requirement for sustained and prolonged expression of one or more developmental potential altering factors in the cell or its immediate progeny. Traditionally such sustained expression has been achieved by introducing DNA or viral vectors to a cell. These traditional approaches have limited therapeutic utility due to the potential for insertional mutagenesis. The compositions and methods described herein completely avoid such risks related to genomic alterations.

One of the areas that can most benefit from the ability to express a desired protein or proteins over a sustained period of time from exogenous synthetic modified RNAs as described herein is the generation of pluripotent or multipotent cells from cells initially having a more differentiated phenotype. In this aspect synthetic modified RNAs encoding a reprogramming factor or factors are used to reprogram cells to a less differentiated phenotype i.e. having a greater developmental potential. Unexpectedly the inventors have discovered that the synthetic modified RNAs described herein permit both dramatically enhanced efficiency and rate of cellular reprogramming relative to DNA or viral vector mediated reprogramming methods.

A major goal of stem cell technology is to make the stem cell differentiate into a desired cell type i.e. directed differentiation. Not only are the compositions and methods described herein useful for reprogramming cells they are also applicable to this directed differentiation of cells to a desired phenotype. That is the same technology described herein for reprogramming is directly applicable to the differentiation of the reprogrammed cell or any other stem cell or precursor cell for that matter to a desired cell type.

Accordingly in one aspect provided herein are synthetic modified RNA molecules encoding a polypeptide where the synthetic modified RNA molecule comprises one or more modifications such that introducing the synthetic modified RNA molecule to a cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to a cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising the one or more modifications.

For convenience certain terms employed herein in the specification examples and appended claims are collected here. Unless stated otherwise or implicit from context the following terms and phrases include the meanings provided below. Unless explicitly stated otherwise or apparent from context the terms and phrases below do not exclude the meaning that the term or phrase has acquired in the art to which it pertains. The definitions are provided to aid in describing particular embodiments and are not intended to limit the claimed invention because the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. Unless otherwise defined all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

As used herein the terms developmental potential or developmental potency refer to the total of all developmental cell fates or cell types that can be achieved by a cell upon differentiation. Thus a cell with greater or higher developmental potential can differentiate into a greater variety of different cell types than a cell having a lower or decreased developmental potential. The developmental potential of a cell can range from the highest developmental potential of a totipotent cell which in addition to being able to give rise to all the cells of an organism can give rise to extra embryonic tissues to a unipotent cell which has the capacity to differentiate into only one type of tissue or cell type but has the property of self renewal as described herein to a terminally differentiated cell which has the lowest developmental potential. A cell with parental developmental potential refers to a cell having the developmental potential of the parent cell that gave rise to it.

The term totipotency refers to a cell with a developmental potential to make all of the cells in the adult body as well as the extra embryonic tissues including the placenta. The fertilized egg zygote is totipotent as are the cells blastomeres of the morula up to the 16 cell stage following fertilization .

The term pluripotent as used herein refers to a cell with the developmental potential under different conditions to differentiate to cell types characteristic of all three germ cell layers i.e. endoderm e.g. gut tissue mesoderm including blood muscle and vessels and ectoderm such as skin and nerve . A pluripotent cell has a lower developmental potential than a totipotent cell. The ability of a cell to differentiate to all three germ layers can be determined using for example a nude mouse teratoma formation assay. In some embodiments pluripotency can also evidenced by the expression of embryonic stem ES cell markers although the preferred test for pluripotency of a cell or population of cells generated using the compositions and methods described herein is the demonstration that a cell has the developmental potential to differentiate into cells of each of the three germ layers. In some embodiments a pluripotent cell is termed an undifferentiated cell. Accordingly the terms pluripotency or a pluripotent state as used herein refer to the developmental potential of a cell that provides the ability for the cell to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm . Those of skill in the art are aware of the embryonic germ layer or lineage that gives rise to a given cell type. A cell in a pluripotent state typically has the potential to divide in vitro for a long period of time e.g. greater than one year or more than 30 passages.

The term multipotent when used in reference to a multipotent cell refers to a cell that has the developmental potential to differentiate into cells of one or more germ layers but not all three. Thus a multipotent cell can also be termed a partially differentiated cell. Multipotent cells are well known in the art and examples of multipotent cells include adult stem cells such as for example hematopoietic stem cells and neural stem cells. Multipotent indicates that a cell may form many types of cells in a given lineage but not cells of other lineages. For example a multipotent hematopoietic cell can form the many different types of blood cells red white platelets etc. . . . but it cannot form neurons. Accordingly the term multipotency refers to a state of a cell with a degree of developmental potential that is less than totipotent and pluripotent.

The terms stem cell or undifferentiated cell as used herein refer to a cell in an undifferentiated or partially differentiated state that has the property of self renewal and has the developmental potential to differentiate into multiple cell types without a specific implied meaning regarding developmental potential i.e. totipotent pluripotent multipotent etc. . A stem cell is capable of proliferation and giving rise to more such stem cells while maintaining its developmental potential. In theory self renewal can occur by either of two major mechanisms. Stem cells can divide asymmetrically which is known as obligatory asymmetrical differentiation with one daughter cell retaining the developmental potential of the parent stem cell and the other daughter cell expressing some distinct other specific function phenotype and or developmental potential from the parent cell. The daughter cells themselves can be induced to proliferate and produce progeny that subsequently differentiate into one or more mature cell types while also retaining one or more cells with parental developmental potential. A differentiated cell may derive from a multipotent cell which itself is derived from a multipotent cell and so on. While each of these multipotent cells may be considered stem cells the range of cell types each such stem cell can give rise to i.e. their developmental potential can vary considerably. Alternatively some of the stem cells in a population can divide symmetrically into two stem cells known as stochastic differentiation thus maintaining some stem cells in the population as a whole while other cells in the population give rise to differentiated progeny only. Accordingly the term stem cell refers to any subset of cells that have the developmental potential under particular circumstances to differentiate to a more specialized or differentiated phenotype and which retain the capacity under certain circumstances to proliferate without substantially differentiating. In some embodiments the term stem cell refers generally to a naturally occurring parent cell whose descendants progeny cells specialize often in different directions by differentiation e.g. by acquiring completely individual characters as occurs in progressive diversification of embryonic cells and tissues. Some differentiated cells also have the capacity to give rise to cells of greater developmental potential. Such capacity may be natural or may be induced artificially upon treatment with various factors. Cells that begin as stem cells might proceed toward a differentiated phenotype but then can be induced to reverse and re express the stem cell phenotype a term often referred to as dedifferentiation or reprogramming or retrodifferentiation by persons of ordinary skill in the art.

The term embryonic stem cell as used herein refers to naturally occurring pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the embryonic blastocyst see for e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 843 780 6 200 806 7 029 913 7 584 479 which are incorporated herein by reference . Such cells can similarly be obtained from the inner cell mass of blastocysts derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 945 577 5 994 619 6 235 970 which are incorporated herein by reference . Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers ectoderm endoderm and mesoderm. In other words they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra embryonic membranes or the placenta i.e. are not totipotent.

As used herein the distinguishing characteristics of an embryonic stem cell define an embryonic stem cell phenotype. Accordingly a cell has the phenotype of an embryonic stem cell if it possesses one or more of the unique characteristics of an embryonic stem cell such that that cell can be distinguished from other cells not having the embryonic stem cell phenotype. Exemplary distinguishing embryonic stem cell phenotype characteristics include without limitation expression of specific cell surface or intracellular markers including protein and microRNAs gene expression profiles methylation profiles deacetylation profiles proliferative capacity differentiation capacity karyotype responsiveness to particular culture conditions and the like. In some embodiments the determination of whether a cell has an embryonic stem cell phenotype is made by comparing one or more characteristics of the cell to one or more characteristics of an embryonic stem cell line cultured within the same laboratory.

The term somatic stem cell is used herein to refer to any pluripotent or multipotent stem cell derived from non embryonic tissue including fetal juvenile and adult tissue. Natural somatic stem cells have been isolated from a wide variety of adult tissues including blood bone marrow brain olfactory epithelium skin pancreas skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Each of these somatic stem cells can be characterized based on gene expression factor responsiveness and morphology in culture. Exemplary naturally occurring somatic stem cells include but are not limited to neural stem cells neural crest stem cells mesenchymal stem cells hematopoietic stem cells and pancreatic stem cells. In some aspects described herein a somatic pluripotent cell refers to a somatic cell or a progeny cell of the somatic cell that has had its developmental potential altered i.e. increased to that of a pluripotent state by contacting with or the introduction of one or more reprogramming factors using the compositions and methods described herein.

The term progenitor cell is used herein to refer to cells that have greater developmental potential i.e. a cellular phenotype that is more primitive e.g. is at an earlier step along a developmental pathway or progression relative to a cell which it can give rise to by differentiation. Often progenitor cells have significant or very high proliferative potential. Progenitor cells can give rise to multiple distinct cells having lower developmental potential i.e. differentiated cell types or to a single differentiated cell type depending on the developmental pathway and on the environment in which the cells develop and differentiate.

As used herein the term somatic cell refers to any cell other than a germ cell a cell present in or obtained from a pre implantation embryo or a cell resulting from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. Stated another way a somatic cell refers to any cell forming the body of an organism as opposed to a germline cell. In mammals germline cells also known as gametes are the spermatozoa and ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote from which the entire mammalian embryo develops. Every other cell type in the mammalian body apart from the sperm and ova the cells from which they are made gametocytes and undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic stem cells is a somatic cell internal organs skin bones blood and connective tissue are all made up of somatic cells. In some embodiments the somatic cell is a non embryonic somatic cell by which is meant a somatic cell that is not present in or obtained from an embryo and does not result from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. In some embodiments the somatic cell is an adult somatic cell by which is meant a cell that is present in or obtained from an organism other than an embryo or a fetus or results from proliferation of such a cell in vitro. Unless otherwise indicated the compositions and methods for reprogramming a somatic cell described herein can be performed both in vivo and in vitro where in vivo is practiced when a somatic cell is present within a subject and where in vitro is practiced using an isolated somatic cell maintained in culture .

The term differentiated cell encompasses any somatic cell that is not in its native form pluripotent as that term is defined herein. Thus the term a differentiated cell also encompasses cells that are partially differentiated such as multipotent cells or cells that are stable non pluripotent partially reprogrammed or partially differentiated cells generated using any of the compositions and methods described herein. In some embodiments a differentiated cell is a cell that is a stable intermediate cell such as a non pluripotent partially reprogrammed cell. It should be noted that placing many primary cells in culture can lead to some loss of fully differentiated characteristics. Thus simply culturing such differentiated or somatic cells does not render these cells non differentiated cells e.g. undifferentiated cells or pluripotent cells. The transition of a differentiated cell including stable non pluripotent partially reprogrammed cell intermediates to pluripotency requires a reprogramming stimulus beyond the stimuli that lead to partial loss of differentiated character upon placement in culture. Reprogrammed and in some embodiments partially reprogrammed cells also have the characteristic of having the capacity to undergo extended passaging without loss of growth potential relative to parental cells having lower developmental potential which generally have capacity for only a limited number of divisions in culture. In some embodiments the term differentiated cell also refers to a cell of a more specialized cell type i.e. decreased developmental potential derived from a cell of a less specialized cell type i.e. increased developmental potential e.g. from an undifferentiated cell or a reprogrammed cell where the cell has undergone a cellular differentiation process.

The term reprogramming as used herein refers to a process that reverses the developmental potential of a cell or population of cells e.g. a somatic cell . Stated another way reprogramming refers to a process of driving a cell to a state with higher developmental potential i.e. backwards to a less differentiated state. The cell to be reprogrammed can be either partially or terminally differentiated prior to reprogramming. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein reprogramming encompasses a complete or partial reversion of the differentiation state i.e. an increase in the developmental potential of a cell to that of a cell having a pluripotent state. In some embodiments reprogramming encompasses driving a somatic cell to a pluripotent state such that the cell has the developmental potential of an embryonic stem cell i.e. an embryonic stem cell phenotype. In some embodiments reprogramming also encompasses a partial reversion of the differentiation state or a partial increase of the developmental potential of a cell such as a somatic cell or a unipotent cell to a multipotent state. Reprogramming also encompasses partial reversion of the differentiation state of a cell to a state that renders the cell more susceptible to complete reprogramming to a pluripotent state when subjected to additional manipulations such as those described herein. Such manipulations can result in endogenous expression of particular genes by the cells or by the progeny of the cells the expression of which contributes to or maintains the reprogramming. In certain embodiments reprogramming of a cell using the synthetic modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein causes the cell to assume a multipotent state e.g. is a multipotent cell . In some embodiments reprogramming of a cell e.g. a somatic cell using the synthetic modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein causes the cell to assume a pluripotent like state or an embryonic stem cell phenotype. The resulting cells are referred to herein as reprogrammed cells somatic pluripotent cells and RNA induced somatic pluripotent cells. The term partially reprogrammed somatic cell as referred to herein refers to a cell which has been reprogrammed from a cell with lower developmental potential by the methods as disclosed herein such that the partially reprogrammed cell has not been completely reprogrammed to a pluripotent state but rather to a non pluripotent stable intermediate state. Such a partially reprogrammed cell can have a developmental potential lower that a pluripotent cell but higher than a multipotent cell as those terms are defined herein. A partially reprogrammed cell can for example differentiate into one or two of the three germ layers but cannot differentiate into all three of the germ layers.

The term developmental potential altering factor as used herein refers to a factor such as a protein or RNA the expression of which alters the developmental potential of a cell e.g. a somatic cell to another developmental state e.g. a pluripotent state. Such an alteration in the developmental potential can be a decrease i.e. to a more differentiated developmental state or an increase i.e. to a less differentiated developmental state . A developmental potential altering factor can be for example an RNA or protein product of a gene encoding a reprogramming factor such as SOX2 an RNA or protein product of a gene encoding a cell type specific polypeptide transcription factor such as myoD a microRNA a small molecule and the like.

The term a reprogramming factor as used herein refers to a developmental potential altering factor as that term is defined herein such as a protein RNA or small molecule the expression of which contributes to the reprogramming of a cell e.g. a somatic cell to a less differentiated or undifferentiated state e.g. to a cell of a pluripotent state or partially pluripotent state. A reprogramming factor can be for example transcription factors that can reprogram cells to a pluripotent state such as SOX2 OCT3 4 KLF4 NANOG LIN 28 c MYC and the like including as any gene protein RNA or small molecule that can substitute for one or more of these in a method of reprogramming cells in vitro. In some embodiments exogenous expression of a reprogramming factor using the synthetic modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein induces endogenous expression of one or more reprogramming factors such that exogenous expression of one or more reprogramming factors is no longer required for stable maintenance of the cell in the reprogrammed or partially reprogrammed state. Reprogramming to a pluripotent state in vitro is used herein to refer to in vitro reprogramming methods that do not require and or do not include nuclear or cytoplasmic transfer or cell fusion e.g. with oocytes embryos germ cells or pluripotent cells. A reprogramming factor can also be termed a de differentiation factor which refers to a developmental potential altering factor as that term is defined herein such as a protein or RNA that induces a cell to de differentiate to a less differentiated phenotype that is a de differentiation factor increases the developmental potential of a cell.

As used herein the term differentiation factor refers to a developmental potential altering factor as that term is defined herein such as a protein RNA or small molecule that induces a cell to differentiate to a desired cell type i.e. a differentiation factor reduces the developmental potential of a cell. In some embodiments a differentiation factor can be a cell type specific polypeptide however this is not required. Differentiation to a specific cell type can require simultaneous and or successive expression of more than one differentiation factor. In some aspects described herein the developmental potential of a cell or population of cells is first increased via reprogramming or partial reprogramming using synthetic modified RNAs as described herein and then the cell or progeny cells thereof produced by such reprogramming are induced to undergo differentiation by contacting with or introducing one or more synthetic modified RNAs encoding differentiation factors such that the cell or progeny cells thereof have decreased developmental potential.

In the context of cell ontogeny the term differentiate or differentiating is a relative term that refers to a developmental process by which a cell has progressed further down a developmental pathway than its immediate precursor cell. Thus in some embodiments a reprogrammed cell as the term is defined herein can differentiate to a lineage restricted precursor cell such as a mesodermal stem cell which in turn can differentiate into other types of precursor cells further down the pathway such as a tissue specific precursor for example a cardiomyocyte precursor and then to an end stage differentiated cell which plays a characteristic role in a certain tissue type and may or may not retain the capacity to proliferate further.

As used herein the term cell type specific polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that is expressed in a cell having a particular phenotype e.g. a muscle cell a pancreatic cell but is not generally expressed in other cell types with different phenotypes. As but one example MyoD is expressed specifically in muscle cells but not in non muscle cells thus MyoD is a cell type specific polypeptide.

As used herein the term without the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell refers to the transdifferentiation of one cell type to another cell type preferably in one step thus a method that modifies the differentiated phenotype or developmental potential of a cell without the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell does not require that the cell be first dedifferentiated or reprogrammed and then differentiated to another cell type. Instead the cell type is merely switched from one cell type to another without going through a less differentiated phenotype. Accordingly transdifferentiation refers to a change in the developmental potential of a cell whereby the cell is induced to become a different cell having a similar developmental potential e.g. a liver cell to a pancreatic cell a pancreatic cell into a pancreatic cell etc.

The term expression refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate secreting proteins including where applicable but not limited to for example transcription translation folding modification and processing.

A factor e.g. a synthetic modified RNA encoding a transcription factor or a protein e.g. a polypeptide is considered exogenous if it is introduced into an immediate precursor cell or a progeny cell that inherits the substance. In contrast the term endogenous refers to a factor or expression product that is native to the biological system or cell e.g. endogenous expression of a gene such as e.g. SOX2 refers to production of a SOX2 polypeptide by the endogenous gene in a cell . In some embodiments the introduction of one or more exogenous factors to a cell e.g. a developmental potential altering factor using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein induces endogenous expression in the cell or progeny cell s thereof of a factor or gene product necessary for maintenance of the cell or progeny cell s thereof in a new developmental potential.

The term isolated or partially purified as used herein refers in the case of a nucleic acid or polypeptide to a nucleic acid or polypeptide separated from at least one other component e.g. nucleic acid or polypeptide that is present with the nucleic acid or polypeptide as found in its natural source and or that would be present with the nucleic acid or polypeptide when expressed by a cell or secreted in the case of secreted polypeptides.

As used herein the term unsupervised clustering analysis or unsupervised cluster analysis refers to methods used in multivariate analysis to divide up objects into similar groups or in some embodiments groups whose members are all close to one another on various dimensions being measured in the various objects. In cluster analysis one does not start with any a priori notion of group characteristics. As used herein hierarchical cluster analysis or hierarchical clustering refer to a general approach to unsupervised cluster analysis in which the purpose is to group together objects or records that are close to one another. A key component of the analysis is repeated calculation of distance measures between objects and between clusters once objects begin to be grouped into clusters. The outcome is typically represented graphically as a dendrogram. Hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed using any of a variety of unbiased computational methods algorithms and software programs known to one of skill in the art that identify clusters or natural data structures from large data sets such as for example gene expression data sets. Such methods include but are not limited to bottom up hierarchical clustering K means clustering Affinity Propagation non Negative Matrix Factorization spectral clustering Self Organizing Map SOM algorithms and the like.

As used herein the term comprising or comprises is used in reference to compositions methods and respective component s thereof that are essential to the invention yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements whether essential or not.

As used herein the term consisting essentially of refers to those elements required for a given embodiment. The term permits the presence of elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel or functional characteristic s of that embodiment of the invention.

The term consisting of refers to compositions methods and respective components thereof as described herein which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the embodiment.

Described herein are novel compositions methods and kits for changing the phenotype of a cell or cells. These methods compositions and kits can be used either to express a desired protein in a cell or tissue or to change the developmental potential or differentiated phenotype of a cell to that of another desired cell type. Significantly the methods and compositions described herein do not utilize exogenous DNA or viral vector based methods for the expression of protein s and thus do not cause permanent modification of the genome or unintended mutagenic effects.

Described herein are synthetic modified RNAs for changing the phenotype of a cell such as expressing a polypeptide or altering the developmental potential. As used herein the term synthetic modified RNA refers to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a factor such as a polypeptide to be expressed in a host cell which comprises at least one modified nucleoside and has at least the following characteristics as the term is used herein i it can be generated by in vitro transcription and is not isolated from a cell ii it is translatable in a mammalian and preferably human cell and iii it does not provoke or provokes a significantly reduced innate immune response or interferon response in a cell to which it is introduced or contacted relative to a synthetic non modified RNA of the same sequence. A synthetic modified RNA as described herein permits repeated transfections in a target cell that is a cell or cell population transfected with a synthetic modified RNA molecule as described herein tolerates repeated transfection with such synthetic modified RNA without significant induction of an innate immune response or interferon response. These three primary criteria for a synthetic modified RNA molecule described above are described in greater detail below.

First the synthetic modified RNA must be able to be generated by in vitro transcription of a DNA template. Methods for generating templates are well known to those of skill in the art using standard molecular cloning techniques. An additional approach to the assembly of DNA templates that does not rely upon the presence of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites is also described herein termed splint mediated ligation . The transcribed synthetic modified RNA polymer can be modified further post transcription e.g. by adding a cap or other functional group.

To be suitable for in vitro transcription the modified nucleoside s must be recognized as substrates by at least one RNA polymerase enzyme. Generally RNA polymerase enzymes can tolerate a range of nucleoside base modifications at least in part because the naturally occurring G A U and C nucleoside bases differ from each other quite significantly. Thus the structure of a modified nucleoside base for use in generating the synthetic modified RNAs described herein can generally vary more than the sugar phosphate moieties of the modified nucleoside. That said ribose and phosphate modified nucleosides or nucleoside analogs are known in the art that permit transcription by RNA polymerases. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the RNA polymerase is a phage RNA polymerase. The modified nucleotides pseudouridine m5U s2U m6A and m5C are known to be compatible with transcription using phage RNA polymerases while N1 methylguanosine N1 methyladenosine N7 methylguanosine 2 methyluridine and 2 O methylcytidine are not. Polymerases that accept modified nucleosides are known to those of skill in the art.

It is also contemplated that modified polymerases can be used to generate synthetic modified RNAs as described herein. Thus for example a polymerase that tolerates or accepts a particular modified nucleoside as a substrate can be used to generate a synthetic modified RNA including that modified nucleoside.

Second the synthetic modified RNA must be translatable by the translation machinery of a eukaryotic preferably mammalian and more preferably human cell. Translation generally requires at least a ribosome binding site a methionine start codon and an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide. Preferably the synthetic modified RNA also comprises a 5 cap a stop codon a Kozak sequence and a polyA tail. In addition mRNAs in a eukaryotic cell are regulated by degradation thus a synthetic modified RNA as described herein can be further modified to extend its half life in the cell by incorporating modifications to reduce the rate of RNA degradation e.g. by increasing serum stability of a synthetic modified RNA .

Nucleoside modifications can interfere with translation. To the extent that a given modification interferes with translation those modifications are not encompassed by the synthetic modified RNA as described herein. One can test a synthetic modified RNA for its ability to undergo translation and translation efficiency using an in vitro translation assay e.g. a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay a reporter activity assay or measurement of a radioactive label in the translated protein and detecting the amount of the polypeptide produced using SDS PAGE Western blot or immunochemistry assays etc. The translation of a synthetic modified RNA comprising a candidate modification is compared to the translation of an RNA lacking the candidate modification such that if the translation of the synthetic modified RNA having the candidate modification remains the same or is increased then the candidate modification is contemplated for use with the compositions and methods described herein. It is noted that fluoro modified nucleosides are generally not translatable and can be used herein as a negative control for an in vitro translation assay.

Third the synthetic modified RNA provokes a reduced or absent innate immune response or interferon response by the transfected cell or population of cells thereof. mRNA produced in eukaryotic cells e.g. mammalian or human cells is heavily modified the modifications permitting the cell to detect RNA not produced by that cell. The cell responds by shutting down translation or otherwise initiating an innate immune or interferon response. Thus to the extent that an exogenously added RNA can be modified to mimic the modifications occurring in the endogenous RNAs produced by a target cell the exogenous RNA can avoid at least part of the target cell s defense against foreign nucleic acids. Thus in some embodiments synthetic modified RNAs as described herein include in vitro transcribed RNAs including modifications as found in eukaryotic mammalian human RNA in vivo. Other modifications that mimic such naturally occurring modifications can also be helpful in producing a synthetic modified RNA molecule that will be tolerated by a cell. With this as a background or threshold understanding for the requirements of a synthetic modified RNA the various modifications contemplated or useful in the synthetic modified RNAs described herein are discussed further herein below.

In some aspects provided herein are synthetic modified RNA molecules encoding polypeptides where the synthetic modified RNA molecules comprise one or more modifications such that introducing the synthetic modified RNA molecules to a cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to a cell contacted with synthetic RNA molecules encoding the polypeptides not comprising the one or more modifications.

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein include modifications to prevent rapid degradation by endo and exo nucleases and to avoid or reduce the cell s innate immune or interferon response to the RNA. Modifications include but are not limited to for example a end modifications e.g. 5 end modifications phosphorylation dephosphorylation conjugation inverted linkages etc. 3 end modifications conjugation DNA nucleotides inverted linkages etc. b base modifications e.g. replacement with modified bases stabilizing bases destabilizing bases or bases that base pair with an expanded repertoire of partners or conjugated bases c sugar modifications e.g. at the 2 position or 4 position or replacement of the sugar as well as d internucleoside linkage modifications including modification or replacement of the phosphodiester linkages. To the extent that such modifications interfere with translation i.e. results in a reduction of 50 or more in translation relative to the lack of the modification e.g. in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation assay the modification is not suitable for the methods and compositions described herein. Specific examples of synthetic modified RNA compositions useful with the methods described herein include but are not limited to RNA molecules containing modified or non natural internucleoside linkages. Synthetic modified RNAs having modified internucleoside linkages include among others those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the internucleoside linkage. In other embodiments the synthetic modified RNA has a phosphorus atom in its internucleoside linkage s .

Non limiting examples of modified internucleoside linkages include phosphorothioates chiral phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates phosphotriesters aminoalkylphosphotriesters methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3 alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates phosphinates phosphoramidates including 3 amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates thionophosphoramidates thionoalkylphosphonates thionoalkylphosphotriesters and boranophosphates having normal 3 5 linkages 2 5 linked analogs of these and those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3 5 to 5 3 or 2 5 to 5 2 . Various salts mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.

At a minimum a synthetic modified RNA molecule comprising at least one modified nucleoside comprises a single nucleoside with a modification as described herein. It is not necessary for all positions in a given synthetic modified RNA to be uniformly modified and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications can be incorporated in a single synthetic modified RNA or even at a single nucleoside within a synthetic modified RNA. However it is preferred but not absolutely necessary that each occurrence of a given nucleoside in a molecule is modified e.g. each cytosine is a modified cytosine e.g. 5mC . However it is also contemplated that different occurrences of the same nucleoside can be modified in a different way in a given synthetic modified RNA molecule e.g. some cytosines modified as 5mC others modified as 2 O methylcytidine or other cytosine analog .

Modified nucleosides also include natural bases that comprise conjugated moieties e.g. a ligand. As discussed herein above the RNA containing the modified nucleosides must be translatable in a host cell i.e. does not prevent translation of the polypeptide encoded by the modified RNA . For example transcripts containing s2U and m6A are translated poorly in rabbit reticulocyte lysates while pseudouridine m5U and m5C are compatible with efficient translation. In addition it is known in the art that 2 fluoro modified bases useful for increasing nuclease resistance of a transcript leads to very inefficient translation. Translation can be assayed by one of ordinary skill in the art using e.g. a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation assay.

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein can further comprise a 5 cap. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the synthetic modified RNAs comprise a 5 cap comprising a modified guanine nucleotide that is linked to the 5 end of an RNA molecule using a 5 5 triphosphate linkage. As used herein the term 5 cap is also intended to encompass other 5 cap analogs including e.g. 5 diguanosine cap tetraphosphate cap analogs having a methylene bis phosphonate moiety see e.g. Rydzik A M et al. 2009 7 22 4763 76 dinucleotide cap analogs having a phosphorothioate modification see e.g. Kowalska J. et al. 2008 14 6 1119 1131 cap analogs having a sulfur substitution for a non bridging oxygen see e.g. Grudzien Nogalska E. et al. 2007 13 10 1745 1755 N7 benzylated dinucleoside tetraphosphate analogs see e.g. Grudzien E. et al. 2004 10 9 1479 1487 or anti reverse cap analogs see e.g. Jemielity J. et al. 2003 RNA 9 9 1108 1122 and Stepinski J. et al. 2001 RNA 7 10 1486 1495 . In one such embodiment the 5 cap analog is a 5 diguanosine cap. In some embodiments the synthetic modified RNA does not comprise a 5 triphosphate.

The 5 cap is important for recognition and attachment of an mRNA to a ribosome to initiate translation. The 5 cap also protects the synthetic modified RNA from 5 exonuclease mediated degradation. It is not an absolute requirement that a synthetic modified RNA comprise a 5 cap and thus in other embodiments the synthetic modified RNAs lack a 5 cap. However due to the longer half life of synthetic modified RNAs comprising a 5 cap and the increased efficiency of translation synthetic modified RNAs comprising a 5 cap are preferred herein.

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein can further comprise a 5 and or 3 untranslated region UTR . Untranslated regions are regions of the RNA before the start codon 5 and after the stop codon 3 and are therefore not translated by the translation machinery. Modification of an RNA molecule with one or more untranslated regions can improve the stability of an mRNA since the untranslated regions can interfere with ribonucleases and other proteins involved in RNA degradation. In addition modification of an RNA with a 5 and or 3 untranslated region can enhance translational efficiency by binding proteins that alter ribosome binding to an mRNA. Modification of an RNA with a 3 UTR can be used to maintain a cytoplasmic localization of the RNA permitting translation to occur in the cytoplasm of the cell. In one embodiment the synthetic modified RNAs described herein do not comprise a 5 or 3 UTR. In another embodiment the synthetic modified RNAs comprise either a 5 or 3 UTR. In another embodiment the synthetic modified RNAs described herein comprise both a 5 and a 3 UTR. In one embodiment the 5 and or 3 UTR is selected from an mRNA known to have high stability in the cell e.g. a murine alpha globin 3 UTR . In some embodiments the 5 UTR the 3 UTR or both comprise one or more modified nucleosides.

In some embodiments the synthetic modified RNAs described herein further comprise a Kozak sequence. The Kozak sequence refers to a sequence on eukaryotic mRNA having the consensus gcc gccRccAUGG SEQ ID NO 1481 where R is a purine adenine or guanine three bases upstream of the start codon AUG which is followed by another G . The Kozak consensus sequence is recognized by the ribosome to initiate translation of a polypeptide. Typically initiation occurs at the first AUG codon encountered by the translation machinery that is proximal to the 5 end of the transcript. However in some cases this AUG codon can be bypassed in a process called leaky scanning. The presence of a Kozak sequence near the AUG codon will strengthen that codon as the initiating site of translation such that translation of the correct polypeptide occurs. Furthermore addition of a Kozak sequence to a synthetic modified RNA will promote more efficient translation even if there is no ambiguity regarding the start codon. Thus in some embodiments the synthetic modified RNAs described herein further comprise a Kozak consensus sequence at the desired site for initiation of translation to produce the correct length polypeptide. In some such embodiments the Kozak sequence comprises one or more modified nucleosides.

In some embodiments the synthetic modified RNAs described herein further comprise a poly A tail which refers to a 3 homopolymeric tail of adenine nucleotides which can vary in length e.g. at least 5 adenine nucleotides and can be up to several hundred adenine nucleotides . The inclusion of a 3 poly A tail can protect the synthetic modified RNA from degradation in the cell and also facilitates extra nuclear localization to enhance translation efficiency. In some embodiments the poly A tail comprises between 1 and 500 adenine nucleotides in other embodiments the poly A tail comprises at least 5 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 110 at least 120 at least 130 at least 140 at least 150 at least 160 at least 170 at least 180 at least 190 at least 200 at least 225 at least 250 at least 275 at least 300 at least 325 at least 350 at least 375 at least 400 at least 425 at least 450 at least 475 at least 500 adenine nucleotides or more. In one embodiment the poly A tail comprises between 1 and 150 adenine nucleotides. In another embodiment the poly A tail comprises between 90 and 120 adenine nucleotides. In some such embodiments the poly A tail comprises one or more modified nucleosides.

It is contemplated that one or more modifications to the synthetic modified RNAs described herein permit greater stability of the synthetic modified RNA in a cell. To the extent that such modifications permit translation and either reduce or do not exacerbate a cell s innate immune or interferon response to the synthetic modified RNA with the modification such modifications are specifically contemplated for use herein. Generally the greater the stability of a synthetic modified RNA the more protein can be produced from that synthetic modified RNA. Typically the presence of AU rich regions in mammalian mRNAs tend to destabilize transcripts as cellular proteins are recruited to AU rich regions to stimulate removal of the poly A tail of the transcript. Loss of a poly A tail of a synthetic modified RNA can result in increased RNA degradation. Thus in one embodiment a synthetic modified RNA as described herein does not comprise an AU rich region. In particular it is preferred that the 3 UTR substantially lacks AUUUA sequence elements.

In one embodiment a ligand alters the cellular uptake intracellular targeting or half life of a synthetic modified RNA into which it is incorporated. In some embodiments a ligand provides an enhanced affinity for a selected target e.g. molecule cell or cell type intracellular compartment e.g. mitochondria cytoplasm peroxisome lysosome as e.g. compared to a composition absent such a ligand. Preferred ligands do not interfere with expression of a polypeptide from the synthetic modified RNA.

Ligands can include a naturally occurring substance such as a protein e.g. human serum albumin HSA low density lipoprotein LDL or globulin carbohydrate e.g. a dextran pullulan chitin chitosan inulin cyclodextrin or hyaluronic acid or a lipid. The ligand can also be a recombinant or synthetic molecule such as a synthetic polymer e.g. a synthetic polyamino acid. Examples of polyamino acids include polylysine PLL poly L aspartic acid poly L glutamic acid styrene maleic acid anhydride copolymer poly L lactide co glycolied copolymer divinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymer N 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide copolymer HMPA polyethylene glycol PEG polyvinyl alcohol PVA polyurethane poly 2 ethylacryllic acid N isopropylacrylamide polymers or polyphosphazine. Example of polyamines include polyethylenimine polylysine PLL spermine spermidine polyamine pseudopeptide polyamine peptidomimetic polyamine dendrimer polyamine arginine amidine protamine cationic lipid cationic porphyrin quaternary salt of a polyamine or an alpha helical peptide.

Ligands can also include targeting groups e.g. a cell targeting agent e.g. a lectin glycoprotein lipid or protein or an antibody that binds to a specified cell type such as a fibroblast cell. A targeting group can be for example a thyrotropin melanotropin lectin glycoprotein surfactant protein A Mucin carbohydrate multivalent lactose multivalent galactose N acetyl galactosamine N acetyl glucosamine multivalent mannose multivalent fucose glycosylated polyaminoacids multivalent galactose transferrin bisphosphonate polyglutamate polyaspartate a lipid cholesterol a steroid bile acid folate vitamin B12 biotin or an RGD peptide or RGD peptide mimetic among others.

Other examples of ligands include dyes intercalating agents e.g. acridines cross linkers e.g. psoralene mitomycin C porphyrins TPPC4 texaphyrin Sapphyrin polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. phenazine dihydrophenazine artificial endonucleases e.g. EDTA lipophilic molecules e.g. cholesterol cholic acid adamantane acetic acid 1 pyrene butyric acid dihydrotestosterone 1 3 Bis O hexadecyl glycerol geranyloxyhexyl group hexadecylglycerol borneol menthol 1 3 propanediol heptadecyl group palmitic acid myristic acid O3 oleoyl lithocholic acid O3 oleoyl cholenic acid dimethoxytrityl or phenoxazine and peptide conjugates e.g. antennapedia peptide Tat peptide alkylating agents amino mercapto PEG e.g. PEG 40K MPEG MPEG 2 polyamino alkyl substituted alkyl radiolabeled markers enzymes haptens e.g. biotin and transport absorption facilitators e.g. aspirin vitamin E folic acid .

Ligands can be proteins e.g. glycoproteins or peptides e.g. molecules having a specific affinity for a co ligand or antibodies e.g. an antibody that binds to a specified cell type such as a fibroblast cell or other cell useful in the production of polypeptides. Ligands can also include hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non peptidic species such as lipids lectins carbohydrates vitamins cofactors multivalent lactose multivalent galactose N acetyl galactosamine N acetyl glucosamine multivalent mannose or multivalent fucose.

The ligand can be a substance e.g. a drug which can increase the uptake of the synthetic modified RNA or a composition thereof into the cell for example by disrupting the cell s cytoskeleton e.g. by disrupting the cell s microtubules microfilaments and or intermediate filaments. The drug can be for example taxol vincristine vinblastine cytochalasin nocodazole japlakinolide latrunculin A phalloidin swinholide A indanocine or myoservin.

One exemplary ligand is a lipid or lipid based molecule. A lipid or lipid based ligand can a increase resistance to degradation and or b increase targeting or transport into a target cell or cell membrane. A lipid based ligand can be used to modulate e.g. binding of the modified RNA composition to a target cell.

In another aspect the ligand is a moiety e.g. a vitamin which is taken up by a host cell. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A E and K. Other exemplary vitamins include B vitamin e.g. folic acid B12 riboflavin biotin pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up for example by cancer cells. Also included are HSA and low density lipoprotein LDL .

In another aspect the ligand is a cell permeation agent preferably a helical cell permeation agent. Preferably the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide it can be modified including a peptidylmimetic invertomers non peptide or pseudo peptide linkages and use of D amino acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha helical agent which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.

A cell permeation peptide is capable of permeating a cell e.g. a microbial cell such as a bacterial or fungal cell or a mammalian cell such as a human cell. A microbial cell permeating peptide can be for example an helical linear peptide e.g. LL 37 or Ceropin P1 a disulfide bond containing peptide e.g. defensin defensin or bactenecin or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids e.g. PR 39 or indolicidin . For example a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide such as MPG which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV 1 gp41 and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen Simeoni et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 31 2717 2724 2003 .

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be synthesized and or modified by methods well established in the art such as those described in Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry Beaucage S. L. et al. Edrs. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York N.Y. USA which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Transcription methods are described further herein in the Examples.

In one embodiment of the aspects described herein a template for a synthetic modified RNA is synthesized using splint mediated ligation which allows for the rapid synthesis of DNA constructs by controlled concatenation of long oligos and or dsDNA PCR products and without the need to introduce restriction sites at the joining regions. It can be used to add generic untranslated regions UTRs to the coding sequences of genes during T7 template generation. Splint mediated ligation can also be used to add nuclear localization sequences to an open reading frame and to make dominant negative constructs with point mutations starting from a wild type open reading frame. Briefly single stranded and or denatured dsDNA components are annealed to splint oligos which bring the desired ends into conjunction the ends are ligated by a thermostable DNA ligase and the desired constructs amplified by PCR. A synthetic modified RNA is then synthesized from the template using an RNA polymerase in vitro. After synthesis of a synthetic modified RNA is complete the DNA template is removed from the transcription reaction prior to use with the methods described herein.

In some embodiments of these aspects the synthetic modified RNAs are further treated with an alkaline phosphatase.

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein a plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs are contacted with or introduced to a cell population of cells or cell culture and permit expression of at least two polypeptide products in the cell. In some embodiments synthetic modified RNA compositions comprise two or more synthetic modified RNAs e.g. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more synthetic modified RNAs. In some embodiments the two or more synthetic modified RNAs are capable of increasing expression of a desired polypeptide product e.g. a transcription factor a cell surface marker a death receptor etc. .

In some embodiments when a plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs synthetic modified RNA compositions or media comprising a plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs are used to modulate expression of a desired set of polypeptides the plurality of synthetic modified RNAs can be contacted with or introduced to a cell population of cells or cell culture simultaneously. In other embodiments the plurality of synthetic modified RNAs can be contacted with or introduced to a cell population of cells or cell culture separately. In addition each synthetic modified RNA can be administered according to its own dosage regime. For example in one embodiment a composition can be prepared comprising a plurality of synthetic modified RNAs in differing relative amounts or in equal amounts that is contacted with a cell such that the plurality of synthetic modified RNAs are administered simultaneously. Alternatively one synthetic modified RNA at a time can be administered to a cell culture e.g. sequentially . In this manner the expression desired for each target polypeptide can be easily tailored by altering the frequency of administration and or the amount of a particular synthetic modified RNA administered. Contacting a cell with each synthetic modified RNA separately can also prevent interactions between the synthetic modified RNAs that can reduce efficiency of expression. For ease of use and to prevent potential contamination it is preferred to administer to or contact a cell population of cells or cell culture with a cocktail of different synthetic modified RNAs thereby reducing the number of doses required and minimizing the chance of introducing a contaminant to the cell population of cells or cell culture.

The methods and compositions described herein permit the expression of one or more polypeptides to be tuned to a desired level by varying the amount of each synthetic modified RNA transfected. One of skill in the art can easily monitor the expression level of the polypeptide encoded by a synthetic modified RNA using e.g. Western blotting techniques or immunocytochemistry techniques. A synthetic modified RNA can be administered at a frequency and dose that permit a desired level of expression of the polypeptide. Each different synthetic modified RNA can be administered at its own dose and frequency to permit appropriate expression. In addition since the synthetic modified RNAs administered to the cell are transient in nature i.e. are degraded over time one of skill in the art can easily remove or stop expression of a synthetic modified RNA by halting further transfections and permitting the cell to degrade the synthetic modified RNA over time. The synthetic modified RNAs will degrade in a manner similar to cellular mRNAs.

A synthetic modified RNA can be introduced into a cell in any manner that achieves intracellular delivery of the synthetic modified RNA such that expression of the polypeptide encoded by the synthetic modified RNA can occur. As used herein the term transfecting a cell refers to the process of introducing nucleic acids into cells using means for facilitating or effecting uptake or absorption into the cell as is understood by those skilled in the art. As the term is used herein transfection does not encompass viral or viral particle based delivery methods. Absorption or uptake of a synthetic modified RNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes or by auxiliary agents or devices. Further approaches are described herein below or known in the art.

A synthetic modified RNA can be introduced into a target cell for example by transfection nucleofection lipofection electroporation see e.g. Wong and Neumann Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 107 584 87 1982 microinjection e.g. by direct injection of a synthetic modified RNA biolistics cell fusion and the like. In an alternative embodiment a synthetic modified RNA can be delivered using a drug delivery system such as a nanoparticle a dendrimer a polymer a liposome or a cationic delivery system. Positively charged cationic delivery systems facilitate binding of a synthetic modified RNA negatively charged polynucleotides and also enhances interactions at the negatively charged cell membrane to permit efficient cellular uptake. Cationic lipids dendrimers or polymers can either be bound to modified RNAs or induced to form a vesicle or micelle see e.g. Kim S H. et al 2008 Journal of Controlled Release 129 2 107 116 that encases the modified RNA. Methods for making and using cationic modified RNA complexes are well within the abilities of those skilled in the art see e.g. Sorensen D R. et al 2003 J. Mol. Biol. 327 761 766 Verma UN. et al 2003 Clin. Cancer Res. 9 1291 1300 Arnold A S et al 2007 J. Hypertens. 25 197 205 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety .

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the composition further comprises a reagent that facilitates uptake of a synthetic modified RNA into a cell transfection reagent such as an emulsion a liposome a cationic lipid a non cationic lipid an anionic lipid a charged lipid a penetration enhancer or alternatively a modification to the synthetic modified RNA to attach e.g. a ligand peptide lipophillic group or targeting moiety.

The process for delivery of a synthetic modified RNA to a cell will necessarily depend upon the specific approach for transfection chosen. One preferred approach is to add the RNA complexed with a cationic transfection reagent see below directly to the cell culture media for the cells.

It is also contemplated herein that a first and second synthetic modified RNA are administered in a separate and temporally distinct manner. Thus each of a plurality of synthetic modified RNAs can be administered at a separate time or at a different frequency interval to achieve the desired expression of a polypeptide. Typically 100 fg to 100 pg of a synthetic modified RNA is administered per cell using cationic lipid mediated transfection. Since cationic lipid mediated transfection is highly inefficient at delivering synthetic modified RNAs to the cytosol other techniques can require less RNA. The entire transcriptome of a mammalian cell constitutes about 1 pg of mRNA and a polypeptide e.g. a transcription factor can have a physiological effect at an abundance of less than 1 fg per cell.

In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein a synthetic modified RNA can be introduced into target cells by transfection or lipofection. Suitable agents for transfection or lipofection include for example calcium phosphate DEAE dextran lipofectin lipofectamine DIMRIE C Superfect and Effectin Qiagen Unifectin Maxifectin DOTMA DOGS Transfectam dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine DOPE 1 2 dioleoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine DOTAP 1 2 dioleoyl 3 trimethylammonium propane DDAB dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide DHDEAB N N di n hexadecyl N N dihydroxyethyl ammonium bromide HDEAB N n hexadecyl N N dihydroxyethylammonium bromide polybrene poly ethylenimine PEI and the like. See e.g. Banerjee et al. Med. Chem. 42 4292 99 1999 Godbey et al. Gene Ther. 6 1380 88 1999 Kichler et al. Gene Ther. 5 855 60 1998 Birchaa et al. J. Pharm. 183 195 207 1999 .

A synthetic modified RNA can be transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers e.g. Oligofectamine or non cationic lipid based carriers e.g. Transit TKOTM Mirus Bio LLC Madison Wis. . Successful introduction of a modified RNA into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example transient transfection can be signaled with a reporter such as a fluorescent marker such as Green Fluorescent Protein GFP . Successful transfection of a modified RNA can also be determined by measuring the protein expression level of the target polypeptide by e.g. Western Blotting or immunocytochemistry.

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the synthetic modified RNA is introduced into a cell using a transfection reagent.

In other embodiments highly branched organic compounds termed dendrimers can be used to bind the exogenous nucleic acid such as the synthetic modified RNAs described herein and introduce it into the cell.

In other embodiments of the aspects described herein non chemical methods of transfection are contemplated. Such methods include but are not limited to electroporation methods whereby an instrument is used to create micro sized holes transiently in the plasma membrane of cells under an electric discharge sono poration transfection via the application of sonic forces to cells and optical transfection methods whereby a tiny 1 m diameter hole is transiently generated in the plasma membrane of a cell using a highly focused laser . In other embodiments particle based methods of transfections are contemplated such as the use of a gene gun whereby the nucleic acid is coupled to a nanoparticle of an inert solid commonly gold which is then shot directly into the target cell s nucleus magnetofection which refers to a transfection method that uses magnetic force to deliver exogenous nucleic acids coupled to magnetic nanoparticles into target cells impalefection which is carried out by impaling cells by elongated nanostructures such as carbon nanofibers or silicon nanowires which have been coupled to exogenous nucleic acids.

Other agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol pyrrols such as 2 pyrrol azones and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein particularly embodiments involving in vivo administration of synthetic modified RNAs or compositions thereof the synthetic modified RNAs described herein are formulated in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers surfactants and or chelators. Suitable surfactants include fatty acids and or esters or salts thereof bile acids and or salts thereof. Suitable bile acids salts include chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA and ursodeoxychenodeoxycholic acid UDCA cholic acid dehydrocholic acid deoxycholic acid glucholic acid glycholic acid glycodeoxycholic acid taurocholic acid taurodeoxycholic acid sodium tauro 24 25 dihydro fusidate and sodium glycodihydrofusidate. Suitable fatty acids include arachidonic acid undecanoic acid oleic acid lauric acid caprylic acid capric acid myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid dicaprate tricaprate monoolein dilaurin glyceryl 1 monocaprate 1 dodecylazacycloheptan 2 one an acylcarnitine an acylcholine or a monoglyceride a diglyceride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof e.g. sodium . In some embodiments combinations of penetration enhancers are used for example fatty acids salts in combination with bile acids salts. One exemplary combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether.

The compositions described herein can be formulated into any of many possible administration forms including a sustained release form. In some preferred embodiments of the aspects described herein formulations comprising a plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs are prepared by first mixing all members of a plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs and then complexing the mixture comprising the plurality of different synthetic modified RNAs with a desired ligand or targeting moiety such as a lipid. The compositions can be formulated as suspensions in aqueous non aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions can further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose sorbitol and or dextran. The suspension can also contain stabilizers.

The compositions described herein can be prepared and formulated as emulsions for the delivery of synthetic modified RNAs. Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 m in diameter see e.g. Ansel s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems Allen L V. Popovich N G. and Ansel H C. 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins 8th ed. New York N.Y. Idson in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. volume 1 p. 199 Rosoff in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. Volume 1 p. 245 Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. volume 2 p. 335 Higuchi et al. in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1985 p. 301 . Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general emulsions can be of either the water in oil w o or the oil in water o w variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase the resulting composition is called a water in oil w o emulsion. Alternatively when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase the resulting composition is called an oil in water o w emulsion. Emulsions can contain further components in addition to the dispersed phases and the active drug i.e. synthetic modified RNA which can be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers stabilizers dyes and anti oxidants can also be present in emulsions as needed. Emulsions can also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as for example in the case of oil in water in oil o w o and water in oil in water w o w emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w o w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o w o emulsion. Emulsifiers can broadly be classified into four categories synthetic surfactants naturally occurring emulsifiers absorption bases and finely dispersed solids see e.g. Ansel s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems Allen L V. Popovich N G. and Ansel H C. 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins 8th ed. New York N.Y. Idson in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. volume 1 p. 199 .

Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin beeswax phosphatides lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids such as heavy metal hydroxides nonswelling clays such as bentonite attapulgite hectorite kaolin montmorillonite colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.

A large variety of non emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats oils waxes fatty acids fatty alcohols fatty esters humectants hydrophilic colloids preservatives and antioxidants Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. volume 1 p. 335 Idson in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Lieberman Rieger and Banker Eds. 1988 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. volume 1 p. 199 .

Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides for example acacia agar alginic acid carrageenan guar gum karaya gum and tragacanth cellulose derivatives for example carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose and synthetic polymers for example carbomers cellulose ethers and carboxyvinyl polymers . These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.

As noted above liposomes can optionally be prepared to contain surface groups to facilitate delivery of liposomes and their contents to specific cell populations. For example a liposome can comprise a surface groups such as antibodies or antibody fragments small effector molecules for interacting with cell surface receptors antigens and other like compounds.

Surface groups can be incorporated into the liposome by including in the liposomal lipids a lipid derivatized with the targeting molecule or a lipid having a polar head chemical group that can be derivatized with the targeting molecule in preformed liposomes. Alternatively a targeting moiety can be inserted into preformed liposomes by incubating the preformed liposomes with a ligand polymer lipid conjugate.

A number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96 40062 Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 221 Tagawa et al. discloses protein bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes can include an RNA molecule. U.S. Pat. No. 5 665 710 Rahman et al. describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97 04787 Love et al. discloses liposomes comprising RNAi molecules targeted to the raf gene. In addition methods for preparing a liposome composition comprising a nucleic acid can be found in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 011 020 6 074 667 6 110 490 6 147 204 6 271 206 6 312 956 6 465 188 6 506 564 6 750 016 and 7 112 337. Each of these approaches can provide delivery of a synthetic modified RNA as described herein to a cell.

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the synthetic modified RNA described herein can be encapsulated in a nanoparticle. Methods for nanoparticle packaging are well known in the art and are described for example in Bose S et al Role of Nucleolin in Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Infection of Human Lung Epithelial Cells.

Importantly the inventors have discovered that the synthetic modified RNAs described herein are significantly less cytotoxic when transfected into cells than their synthetic unmodified RNA counterparts having the same nucleic acid sequence as measured using e.g. TUNEL assay or simply monitoring cellularity after transfection which permits repeated transfections of the cells for the duration necessary to express a polypeptide in a cell or alter the phenotype or developmental fate of the cell. The decrease in cytotoxicity stems in part from the presence of modified nucleoside s in the RNA which reduce or prevent the development of a cellular interferon response. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the cellular innate immune or interferon response comprises expression of a Type I or Type II interferon. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the cellular innate immune response comprises expression of one or more IFN signature genes selected from the group consisting of IFN IFNB1 IFIT OAS1 PKR RIGI CCL5 RAP1A CXCL10 IFIT1 CXCL11 MX1 RP11 167P23.2 HERC5 GALR3 IFIT3 IFIT2 RSAD2 and CDC20. As noted herein such modifications for reducing or preventing the cellular innate response include but are not limited to 5 methylcytidine 5mC N6 methyladenosine m6A 3 2 O dimethyluridine m4U 2 thiouridine s2U 2 fluorouridine pseudouridine 2 O methyluridine Um 2 deoxyuridine 2 dU 4 thiouridine s4U 5 methyluridine m5U 2 O methyladenosine m6A N6 2 O dimethyladenosine m6Am N6 N6 2 O trimethyladenosine m6Am 2 O methylcytidine Cm 7 methylguanosine m7G 2 O methylguanosine Gm N2 7 dimethylguanosine m 2 7G N2 N2 7 trimethylguanosine m 2 2 7G and inosine I . In some preferred embodiments the modifications comprise 5 methylcytidine and pseudouridine.

However the cells transfected with the synthetic modified RNA compositions described herein can further be treated or used with other measures to prevent or reduce any remaining cytotoxicity caused by the transfection procedure the synthetic modified RNAs or a combination thereof. The cytotoxicity of synthetic unmodified RNAs involves a cellular innate immune response designed to recognize a foreign pathogen e.g. virus and to produce interferons which in turn stimulates the activity of the protein kinase PKR Toll like receptors TLRs and RIG 1 among others to mediate anti viral actions. A significant part of an individual cell s innate immune response to foreign RNA is represented by the so called PKR response triggered largely by double stranded RNA. To the extent that all or part of the PKR response pathway can be activated by foreign single stranded RNA such as synthetic modified RNAs described herein the response is discussed herein below.

Double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase PKR is a member of a family of kinases that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF 2 eIF 2 and plays a role in the translational down regulation of gene expression Clemens et al. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994 vol. 19 210 10 . Activation of PKR involves two molecules binding in tandem to double stranded RNA and then phosphorylating each other in an intramolecular event. Wu et al. 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272 1291 1296 . PKR has been implicated in processes that rely on apoptosis as control mechanisms in vivo including antiviral activities cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis Donze et al. EMBO J. 1995 vol. 14 3828 34 Lee et al. Virology 1994 vol. 199 491 6 Jagus et al. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1989 vol. 9 1576 86 . Regulation of protein synthesis through activated PKR arises from the interaction of PKR with foreign RNA.

It has been shown that the PKR response can be reduced by removing the 5 triphosphate on an RNA molecule and that RNAs having a 5 monophosphate diphosphate or 7 methyl guanosine cap do not activate PKR. Thus in one embodiment the synthetic modified RNA described herein comprises a 5 monophosphate a 5 diphosphate or a 5 7 methyl guanosine cap to escape the immune response initiated by PKR. In another embodiment the synthetic modified RNA as described herein is treated to remove the 5 triphosphate using an alkaline phosphatase e.g. calf intestinal phosphatase. Other modifications to prevent activation of the immune response mediators e.g. PKR TLRs and RIG 1 are discussed in detail in Nallagatla S R et al. 2008 5 3 140 144 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

TLR7 is known to recognize single stranded RNA and binds exogenous RNAs such as viral single stranded RNAs in endosomes. Modifications to the RNA that reduce recognition and or signaling by TLR7 can reduce this aspect of the innate immune response to the RNA. TLR7 signals through MyD88 and can activate a type I IFN pathway as well as an NF B IL 8 pathway.

In one embodiment the innate immune response or interferon response can be further decreased in cells transfected with a synthetic modified RNA as described herein by co transfection of a dominant negative mutant of a protein involved in the immunity pathways such as RIG 1 MYD88 VISA PKR and Toll like receptors. Alternatively RNA interference e.g. siRNA shRNA etc. can be used to inhibit expression of RIG 1 MYD88 VISA PKR TRIF TRL7 or TLR8 which will result in a lower innate immune mediated response in the cells.

Another approach to reduce the innate immune mediated response is to inhibit the effect of secreted interferon on cellular receptors for example by scavenging secreted interferon using a soluble interferon receptor e.g. B18R or a neutralizing antibody. In one embodiment a modified RNA encoding an interferon scavenging agent e.g. a soluble interferon receptor can be administered to cells to further reduce the innate immune response of the cells.

In one embodiment the cells transfected with synthetic modified RNA as described herein can be grown with genetically engineered feeder cells that secrete B18R or neutralizing antibodies to type 1 interferons.

Small molecules that inhibit the innate immune response in cells such as chloroquine a TLR signaling inhibitor and 2 aminopurine a PKR inhibitor can also be administered into the culture media of cells transfected with the synthetic modified RNAs described herein. Some non limiting examples of commercially available TLR signaling inhibitors include BX795 chloroquine CLI 095 OxPAPC polymyxin B and rapamycin all available for purchase from INVIVOGEN . In addition inhibitors of pattern recognition receptors PRR which are involved in innate immunity signaling such as 2 aminopurine BX795 chloroquine and H 89 can also be used in the compositions and methods described herein. Media supplementation with cell penetrating peptides that inhibit proteins in the immunity pathways described above can also be combined with the use of synthetic modified RNAs provided herein. Some non limiting examples of commercially available cell penetrating peptides include Pepin MYD INVIVOGEN or Pepinh TRIF INVIVOGEN . An oligodeoxynucleotide antagonist for the Toll like receptor signaling pathway can also be added to the cell culture media to reduce immunity signaling.

Another method for reducing the immune response of a cell transfected with the synthetic modified RNAs described herein is to co transfect mRNAs that encode negative regulators of innate immunity such as NLRX1. Alternatively one can co transfect viral proteins known to modulate host cell defenses such as NS1 NS3 4A or A46R.

In another embodiment a synthetic modified RNA composition encoding inhibitors of the innate immune system can be used to avoid the innate immune response generated in the cell.

It is also contemplated herein that in some embodiments in a research setting one of skill in the art can avoid the innate immune response generated in the cell by using cells genetically deficient in antiviral pathways e.g. VISA knockout cells .

Since induction of the innate immune response results in cytokine release and death of the cells in culture one can determine the extent of activation of an innate immune or interferon response by measuring e.g. apoptosis using e.g. a TUNEL assay reduced growth rate reduced cellularity reduction in global protein production or secretion of cytokines e.g. type I interferons such as IFN alpha and IFN beta type II interferons such as IFN or upregulation of interferon stimulated genes or interferon signature genes e.g. IFN IFNB1 IFIT OAS1 PKR RIGI CCL5 RAP1A CXCL10 IFIT1 CXCL11 MX1 RP11 167P23.2 HERC5 GALR3 IFIT3 IFIT2 RSAD2 and CDC20. The level of cytokine release or cell death in a transfected cell culture treated with one of the above measures described for further reducing the innate immune response can be compared to the level of an equivalent cell culture not treated to further reduce the innate immune response.

Provided herein are cells contacted with a synthetic modified RNA molecule encoding a polypeptide or a progeny cell of the contacted cell where the synthetic modified RNA molecule comprises one or more modifications such that introducing the synthetic modified RNA molecule to the cell results in a reduced innate immune response relative to the cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising the one or more modifications. In some embodiments of these aspects at least two nucleosides are modified. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the cellular innate immune or interferon response comprises expression of a Type I or Type II interferon. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein the cellular innate immune response comprises expression of one or more IFN signature genes selected from the group consisting of IFN IFNB1 IFIT OAS1 PKR RIGI CCL5 RAP1A CXCL10 IFIT1 CXCL11 MX1 RP11 167P23.2 HERC5 GALR3 IFIT3 IFIT2 RSAD2 and CDC20. As described herein such modifications for reducing or preventing the cellular innate immune response include but are not limited to 5 methylcytidine 5mC N6 methyladenosine m6A 3 2 O dimethyluridine m4U 2 thiouridine s2U 2 fluorouridine pseudouridine 2 O methyluridine Um 2 deoxyuridine 2 dU 4 thiouridine s4U 5 methyluridine m5U 2 O methyladenosine m6A N6 2 O dimethyladenosine m6Am N6 N6 2 O trimethyladenosine m6Am 2 O methylcytidine Cm 7 methylguanosine m7G 2 O methylguanosine Gm N2 7 dimethylguanosine m 2 7G N2 N2 7 trimethylguanosine m 2 2 7G and inosine I . In some preferred embodiments the modifications comprise 5 methylcytidine and pseudouridine.

Essentially any cell type can be transfected with synthetic modified RNAs as described herein to alter the phenotype of the cell. Thus differentiated somatic cells and stem cells as well of cells of a cell line can be transfected with synthetic modified RNA as described herein. Provided herein are exemplary somatic cells stem cells and cell line sources useful with the methods and compositions described herein. However the description herein is not meant to be limiting and any cell known or used in the art can be phenotypically modified by introducing one or more synthetic modified RNAs as described herein. In embodiments relating to tissue regeneration or transplantation in a subject the cells can be from an autologous i.e. from the same subject or from heterologous sources.

Essentially any primary somatic cell type can be used in the preparation of cells with an altered phenotype or altered developmental potential described herein. Some non limiting examples of primary cells include but are not limited to fibroblast epithelial endothelial neuronal adipose cardiac skeletal muscle immune cells hepatic splenic lung circulating blood cells gastrointestinal renal bone marrow and pancreatic cells. The cell can be a primary cell isolated from any somatic tissue including but not limited to brain liver lung gut stomach intestine fat muscle uterus skin spleen endocrine organ bone etc. The term somatic cell further encompasses primary cells grown in culture provided that the somatic cells are not immortalized.

Where the cell is maintained under in vitro conditions conventional tissue culture conditions and methods can be used and are known to those of skill in the art. Isolation and culture methods for various cells are well within the abilities of one skilled in the art.

Further the parental cell can be from any mammalian species with non limiting examples including a murine bovine simian porcine equine ovine or human cell. In some embodiments the cell is a human cell. In an alternate embodiment the cell is from a non human organism such as a non human mammal.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the technologies comprising the synthetic modified RNAs described herein is the ability to use such synthetic modified RNAs to both generate a stem cell from a differentiated cell and to then direct the differentiation of the stem cell to one or more desired cell types.

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells defined by their ability at the single cell level to both self renew and differentiate to produce progeny cells including self renewing progenitors non renewing progenitors and terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells depending on their level of differentiation are also characterized by their ability to differentiate in vitro into functional cells of various cell lineages from multiple germ layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm as well as to give rise to tissues of multiple germ layers following transplantation and to contribute substantially to most if not all tissues following injection into blastocysts. See e.g. Potten et al. Development 110 1001 1990 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 376 5 851 832 5 753 506 5 589 376 5 824 489 5 654 183 5 693 482 5 672 499 and 5 849 553 all herein incorporated in their entireties by reference . The stem cells for use with the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be naturally occurring stem cells or induced stem cells generated using the compositions kits and methods described herein or by any method or composition known to one of skill in the art.

It is specifically noted that stem cells are useful not only for exploiting their differentiation potential to make desired cells but also as a source for high quality iPS cells. That is a non pluripotent stem cell can be the starting point for the generation of high quality iPS cells by transfecting the non pluripotent stem cell with one or more synthetic modified RNAs encoding reprogramming factors as described herein.

Stem cells are classified by their developmental potential as 1 totipotent meaning able to give rise to all embryonic and extraembryonic cell types 2 pluripotent meaning able to give rise to all embryonic cell types 3 multipotent meaning able to give rise to a subset of cell lineages but all within a particular tissue organ or physiological system for example hematopoietic stem cells HSC can produce progeny that include HSC self renewal blood cell restricted oligopotent progenitors and the cell types and elements e.g. platelets that are normal components of the blood 4 oligopotent meaning able to give rise to a more restricted subset of cell lineages than multipotent stem cells and 5 unipotent meaning able to give rise to a single cell lineage e.g. spermatogenic stem cells .

Transfection with synthetic modified RNAs directing the reprogramming of somatic differentiated cells to pluripotency is specifically demonstrated herein. However as also demonstrated herein transfection with synthetic modified RNAs can also be used to drive the differentiation i.e. decrease the developmental potential of stem cells other than iPS cells 

Stem cells of interest for producing cells with a desired phenotype or a reduced differentiation potential include embryonic cells of various types exemplified by human embryonic stem hES cells described by Thomson et al. 1998 Science 282 1145 embryonic stem cells from other primates such as Rhesus stem cells Thomson et al. 1995 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 7844 marmoset stem cells Thomson et al. 1996 Biol. Reprod. 55 254 and human embryonic germ hEG cells Shambloft et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 13726 1998 . Also of interest are lineage committed stem cells such as hematopoietic or pancreatic stem cells. In some embodiments the host cell transfected with synthetic modified RNA is a multipotent stem cell or progenitor cell. Examples of multipotent cells useful in methods provided herein include but are not limited to murine embryonic stem ES D3 cells human umbilical vein endothelial HuVEC cells human umbilical artery smooth muscle HuASMC cells human differentiated stem HKB II cells and human mesenchymal stem hMSC cells. An additional stem cell type of interest for use with the compositions and methods described herein are cancer stem cells.

Adult stem cells are generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. However if the starting stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the embryo they can generate many cell types of the body derived from all three embryonic cell types endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm. Stem cells with this property are said to be pluripotent. Embryonic stem cells are one kind of pluripotent stem cell. Thus pluripotent embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into many specific cell types and that differentiation can be driven by the expression of polypeptides from synthetic modified RNAs as described herein. Since the embryo is a potential source of all types of precursor cells it is possible to differentiate embryonic stem cells into other lineages by providing the appropriate signals such as the expression of proteins from synthetic modified RNAs to embryonic stem cells. Somatic stem cells also have major advantages for example using somatic stem cells allows a patient s own cells to be expanded in culture and then re introduced into the patient. In addition and importantly iPS cells generated from a patient provide a source of cells that can be expanded and re introduced to the patient before or after stimulation to differentiate to a desired lineage or phenotype. It is also contemplated that the compositions methods and kits comprising the synthetic modified RNAs described can be used to alter the developmental potential of a cancer stem cell and thus render that cancer cell non cancerous.

Cells derived from embryonic sources can include embryonic stem cells or stem cell lines obtained from a stem cell bank or other recognized depository institution. Other means of producing stem cell lines include the method of Chung et al 2006 which comprises taking a blastomere cell from an early stage embryo prior to formation of the blastocyst at around the 8 cell stage . The technique corresponds to the pre implantation genetic diagnosis technique routinely practiced in assisted reproduction clinics. The single blastomere cell is then co cultured with established ES cell lines and then separated from them to form fully competent ES cell lines.

Cells can also be derived from human umbilical cord blood cells HUCBC which are recognized as a rich source of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells Broxmeyer et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4109 4113 . Cord blood cells are used as a source of transplantable stem and progenitor cells and as a source of marrow repopulating cells for the treatment of malignant diseases e.g. acute lymphoid leukemia acute myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome and nueroblastoma and non malignant diseases such as Fanconi s anemia and aplastic anemia Kohli Kumar et al. 1993 Br. J. Haematol. 85 419 422 Wagner et al. 1992 Blood 79 1874 1881 Lu et al. 1996 Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol 22 61 78 Lu et al. 1995 Cell Transplantation 4 493 503 . One advantage of HUCBC for use with the methods and compositions described herein is the immature immunity of these cells which is very similar to fetal cells and thus significantly reduces the risk for rejection by the host Taylor Bryson 1985 J. Immunol. 134 1493 1497 .

In other embodiments of the aspects described herein cancer stem cells are used with the synthetic modified RNAs described herein in order to for example differentiate or alter the phenotype of a cancer stem cell to a non tumorigenic state. It has been recently discovered that stem like cells are present in some human tumors and while representing a small minority of the total cellular mass of the tumor are the subpopulation of tumor cells responsible for growth of the tumor. In contrast to normal stem cells tumor stem cells or cancer stem cells are defined as cells that can undergo self renewal as well as abnormal proliferation and differentiation to form a tumor. Functional features of tumor stem cells are that they are tumorigenic they can give rise to additional tumorigenic cells by self renewal and they can give rise to non tumorigenic tumor cells. As used herein particularly in reference to an isolated cell or isolated cell population the term tumorigenic refers to a cell derived from a tumor that is capable of forming a tumor when dissociated and transplanted into a suitable animal model such as an immunocompromised mouse. The developmental origin of tumor stem cells can vary among different types of cancers. It is believed without wishing to be bound or limited by theory that tumor stem cells may arise either as a result of genetic damage that deregulates normal mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of stem cells Lapidot et al. Nature 367 6464 645 8 1994 or by the dysregulated proliferation of populations of cells that acquire stem like properties.

Tumors contain a distinct subset of cells that share the properties of normal stem cells in that they proliferate extensively or indefinitely and that they efficiently give rise to additional solid tumor stem cells. Within an established tumor most cells may have lost the ability to proliferate extensively and form new tumors while tumor stem cells proliferate extensively and give rise to additional tumor stem cells as well as to other tumor cells that lack tumorigenic potential. An additional trait of tumor stem cells is their resistance to therapeutics such as chemotherapy. It is the small fraction of tumor stem cells and their immediate daughter cell population that proliferates and ultimately proves fatal.

Examples of tumors from which samples containing cancer stem cells can be isolated from or enriched for use with the compositions and methods described herein include sarcomas and carcinomas such as but not limited to fibrosarcoma myxosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma colon carcinoma pancreatic cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma sweat gland carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinomas cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilms tumor cervical cancer testicular tumor lung carcinoma small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma epithelial carcinoma astrocytic tumors e.g. diffuse infiltrating gliomas anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma gliosarcoma pilocytic astrocytoma pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma oligodendroglial tumors and mixed gliomas e.g. oligodendroglioma anaplastic oligodendroglioma oligoastrocytoma anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ependymal tumors e.g. ependymoma anaplastic ependymoma myxopapillary ependymoma subependymoma choroid plexus tumors neuroepithelial tumors of uncertain origin astroblastoma chordoid glioma gliomatosis cerebri neuronal and mixed neuronal glial tumors e.g. ganglioglioma and gangliocytoma desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor central neurocytoma cerebellar liponeurocytoma paraganglioglioma pineal parenchymal tumors embryonal tumors medulloepithelioma ependymoblastoma medulloblastoma primitive neuroectodemmal tumor atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor peripheral neuroblastic tumors tumors of cranial and peripheral nerves e.g. schwannoma neurinofibroma perineurioma malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor meningeal tumors e.g. meningeomas mesenchymal non meningothelial tumors haemangiopericytomas melanocytic lesions germ cell tumors tumors of the sellar region e.g. craniopharyngioma granular cell tumor of the neurohypophysis hemangioblastoma melanoma and retinoblastoma. Additionally the stem cell isolation methods of the invention are applicable to isolating stem cells from tissues other than characterized tumors e.g. from tissues of diseases such as the so called stem cell pathologies .

Stem cells may be obtained from any mammalian species e.g. human primate equine bovine porcine canine feline rodent e.g. mice rats hamster etc. Embryonic stem cells are considered to be undifferentiated when they have not committed to a specific differentiation lineage. Such cells display morphological characteristics that distinguish them from differentiated cells of embryo or adult origin. Undifferentiated embryonic stem ES cells are easily recognized by those skilled in the art and typically appear in the two dimensions of a microscopic view in colonies of cells with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli.

In some embodiments the stem cell is isolated. Most conventional methods to isolate a particular stem cell of interest involve positive and negative selection using markers of interest. For example agents can be used to recognize stem cell markers for instance labeled antibodies that recognize and bind to cell surface markers or antigens on desired stem cells can be used to separate and isolate the desired stem cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting FACS panning methods magnetic particle selection particle sorter selection and other methods known to persons skilled in the art including density separation Xu et al. 2002 Circ. Res. 91 501 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 20030022367 and separation based on other physical properties Doevendans et al. 2000 J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 32 839 851 .

In those embodiments involving cancer stem cells cancer stem cells can be identified using cell surface markers that also identify normal stem cells in the tissue of origin. As a non limiting example leukemic stem cells LSCs express the CD34 surface marker and lack the CD38 surface antigen as is the case for normal i.e. non leukemic hematopoietic stem cells Bonnet and Dick 1997 . Cancer stem cells identified by cell surface marker expression can be purified by methods known to one of skill in the art such as fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS . Methods of isolating cancer stem cells can be found in United States Patent Application 20100003265 the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.

Alternatively genetic selection methods for isolating stem cells can be used where a stem cell can be genetically engineered to express a reporter protein operatively linked to a tissue specific promoter and or a specific gene promoter therefore the expression of the reporter can be used for positive selection methods to isolate and enrich the desired stem cell. For example a fluorescent reporter protein can be expressed in the desired stem cell by genetic engineering methods to operatively link the marker protein to a promoter active in a desired stem cell Klug et al. 1996 J. Clin. Invest. 98 216 224 U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 054 . Other means of positive selection include drug selection for instance as described by Klug et al. supra involving enrichment of desired cells by density gradient centrifugation. Negative selection can be performed selecting and removing cells with undesired markers or characteristics for example fibroblast markers epithelial cell markers etc.

Undifferentiated ES cells express genes that can be used as markers to detect the presence of undifferentiated cells and whose polypeptide products can be used as markers for negative selection. For example see U.S. application Ser. No. 2003 0224411 A1 Bhattacharya 2004 Blood 103 8 2956 64 and Thomson 1998 supra. each herein incorporated by reference. Human ES cell lines express cell surface markers that characterize undifferentiated nonhuman primate ES and human EC cells including stage specific embryonic antigen SSEA 3 SSEA 4 TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 and alkaline phosphatase. The globo series glycolipid GL7 which carries the SSEA 4 epitope is formed by the addition of sialic acid to the globo series glycolipid Gb5 which carries the SSEA 3 epitope. Thus GL7 reacts with antibodies to both SSEA 3 and SSEA 4. Undifferentiated human ES cell lines do not stain for SSEA 1 but differentiated cells stain strongly for SSEA 1. Methods for proliferating hES cells in the undifferentiated form are described in WO 99 20741 WO 01 51616 and WO 03 020920.

In some embodiments the methods further provide for enrichment and isolation of stem cells. The stem cells are selected for a characteristic of interest. In some embodiments a wide range of markers may be used for selection. One of skill in the art will be able to select markers appropriate for the desired cell type. The characteristics of interest include expression of particular markers of interest for example specific subpopulations of stem cells and stem cell progenitors will express specific markers.

In some embodiments the stem cells used with the compositions and methods described herein are expanded. The cells are optionally collected separated and further expanded generating larger populations of progenitor cells for use in making cells of a particular cell type or cells having a reduced differentiation potential.

In some embodiments the cells used with the synthetic modified RNAs described herein are cells of a cell line. In one such embodiment the host cell is a mammalian cell line. In one such embodiment the mammalian cell line is a human cell line.

While mammalian cells are preferred in some embodiments the host cell transfected with a modified RNA is a plant cell such as a tobacco plant cell.

In some embodiments the transfected cell is an insect cell such as SF9 or SF 21 cells from or S2 cells from

In general cells useful with the methods described herein can be maintained and or expanded in a culture medium that is available to and well known in the art. Such media include but are not limited to Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM DMEM F12 Medium Eagle s Minimum Essential Medium F 12K Medium Iscove s Modified Dulbecco s Medium RPMI 1640 Medium and serum free medium for culture and expansion of progenitor cells SFEM . Many media are also available as low glucose formulations with or without sodium.

Cells can be cultured in low serum or serum free defined culture medium. Serum free medium used to culture cells is described in for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 015 037. Many cells have been grown in serum free or low serum medium. For example the medium can be supplemented with one or more growth factors. Commonly used growth factors include but are not limited to bone morphogenic protein basic fibroblast growth factor platelet derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor Stem cell factor and thrombopoietin. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 169 610 7 109 032 7 037 721 6 617 161 6 617 159 6 372 210 6 224 860 6 037 174 5 908 782 5 766 951 5 397 706 and 4 657 866 all incorporated by reference herein for teaching growing cells in serum free medium.

Cells in culture can be maintained either in suspension or attached to a solid support such as extracellular matrix components. Progenitor cells may require additional factors that encourage their attachment to a solid support such as type I and type II collagen chondroitin sulfate fibronectin superfibronectin and fibronectin like polymers gelatin poly D and poly L lysine thrombospondin and vitronectin. Progenitor cells can also be cultured in low attachment flasks such as but not limited to Corning Low attachment plates.

In some embodiments the host cells are suitable for growth in suspension cultures. Suspension competent host cells are generally monodisperse or grow in loose aggregates without substantial aggregation. Suspension competent host cells include cells that are suitable for suspension culture without adaptation or manipulation e.g. hematopoietic cells lymphoid cells and cells that have been made suspension competent by modification or adaptation of attachment dependent cells e.g. epithelial cells fibroblasts .

In some embodiments the host cell is an attachment dependent cell which is grown and maintained in adherent culture.

The compositions and methods comprising the synthetic modified RNAs described herein permit long term safe and efficient alteration of cellular phenotypes or cellular developmental potentials without the risk of permanent genomic alterations. Such compositions and methods are useful for a variety of applications indications and modalities including but not limited to gene therapy regenerative medicine cancer therapies tissue engineering and drug screening.

Accordingly provided herein are cells contacted with a synthetic modified RNA molecule encoding a polypeptide or a progeny cell of the contacted cell where expression of the encoded polypeptide in the contacted cell alters a function or a developmental phenotype or developmental potential of the cell and results in a reduced innate immune response relative to the cell contacted with a synthetic RNA molecule encoding the polypeptide not comprising any modifications. In some embodiments the developmental potential of the contacted cell is decreased. In some embodiments the developmental potential of the contacted cell is increased. As such the polypeptide encoded by the synthetic modified RNA molecule can be a reprogramming factor a differentiation factor or a de differentiation factor.

Also provided herein are cells comprising an exogenously introduced modified synthetic RNA encoding a developmental potential altering factor. In some embodiments the cell is a human cell. In some embodiments of these aspects the cells or immediate precursor cell s have been subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with the modified synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. In some such embodiments the cells have a reduced expression of a Type I or Type II IFN relative to a cell subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with an exogenously introduced non modified synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. In some such embodiments the cell has a reduced expression of at least one IFN signature gene relative to a human cell subjected to at least 3 separate rounds of contacting with an exogenously introduced non modified synthetic RNA encoding the developmental potential altering factor. As described herein the IFN signature gene can be selected from the group consisting of IFN IFNB1 IFIT OAS1 PKR RIGI CCL5 RAP1A CXCL10 IFIT1 CXCL11 MX1 RP11 167P23.2 HERC5 GALR3 IFIT3 IFIT2 RSAD2 and CDC20. The polypeptide encoded by the exogenous synthetic modified RNA molecule can be a reprogramming factor a differentiation factor or a de differentiation factor. The cell or its immediate precursor cell s can be derived from a somatic cell a partially reprogrammed somatic cell a pluripotent cell a multipotent cell a differentiated cell or an embryonic cell.

As used herein the term developmental potential of a cell refers to the total of all developmental cell fates or cell types that can be achieved by a cell upon differentiation. It should be understood that the developmental potential of a cell represents a spectrum a terminally differentiated cell e.g. a cardiac myocyte has essentially no developmental potential under natural conditions that is under normal circumstances it cannot differentiate to another cell type while at the other end of the spectrum a totipotent embryonic stem cell has the potential to differentiate to or give rise to cells of every type in an organism as well as the extra embryonic structures. A cell with parental developmental potential refers to a cell having the developmental potential of the parent cell that gave rise to it.

The term developmental potential of a cell is relative. For example where a stem cell undergoes differentiation to a more differentiated or specialized phenotype the resulting cell has a reduced developmental potential relative to the stem cell that produced it. Unless specifically stated otherwise the developmental potential of a cell is the potential it has assuming no further manipulation of its potential that is while it is acknowledged that the technology is available as described herein to artificially increase decrease or otherwise alter the developmental potential of nearly any cell to say that a cell has reduced developmental potential means that without further artificial manipulation to force the cell to a less differentiated phenotype the cell can give rise to at least one fewer cell types than its immediate predecessor cell. That is the cell resulting from a differentiation event has a reduced developmental potential despite the fact that it could possibly be manipulated to again become less differentiated. Thus a cell with greater or higher developmental potential can differentiate into a greater variety of different cell types than a cell having a lower or decreased developmental potential.

Where for example a terminally or only partially differentiated cell is induced by artificial manipulation to become an induced pluripotent stem cell an iPS cell the resulting cell has increased developmental potential relative to the cell that produced it. As used herein a change or alteration in the developmental potential of a cell occurs when the range of phenotypes to which a given cell can differentiate or give rise increases or decreases relative to the range naturally available to the cell prior to a differentiation dedifferentiation or trans differentiation event. By increase in this context is meant that there is at least additional one cell type or lineage to which a given cell can differentiate relative to the potential of the starting cell. By decrease in this context is meant that there is at least one fewer cell type or lineage to which the given cell can differentiate or give rise relative to the potential of the starting cell.

Methods of manipulating the developmental potential of a cell both to increase the potential and to decrease it are described herein and others are known in the art. A change or alteration in the developmental potential of a cell can occur naturally where for example a cell differentiates to a more specialized phenotype in its native environment in vivo. In various preferred aspects described herein developmental potential or cell fate are directed by outside manipulation and preferably by transfection with synthetic modified RNA as that term is defined herein. Thus in one aspect cells are contacted or transfected with synthetic modified RNAs encoding one or more factors that re direct or modify the phenotype of the cells.

Synthetic modified RNAs as described herein can be made that direct the expression of essentially any gene product whose coding sequences can be cloned. The expression of the gene product from synthetic modified RNA introduced to a cell that does not normally express that gene product necessarily results in a change in the phenotype of the cell whether or not it changes the differentiation status or differentiation potential of the cell. Simply put the new phenotype is the cell s expression of the new gene product. Thus in one aspect encompassed herein is the expression of a protein from a synthetic modified RNA introduced to a cell. Expression that does not necessarily change the differentiation status of the cell can nonetheless be useful in such embodiments for example where one wishes to correct or replace a defective function in a cell due to a genetic defect or polymorphism or in embodiments to target a cell to a particular location e.g. by expressing a receptor or where one wishes to induce cell death in e.g. a tumor by expressing a death receptor a death ligand a cell cycle inhibitor etc.

In other aspects the synthetic modified RNAs described herein are well suited for directing the expression of any gene sequence but are particularly well suited for modifying the differentiation status or the developmental potential of a cell and for doing so without permanent change to the genome of the cell. This is true in part because reprogramming differentiation and transdifferentiation each require relatively prolonged expression of one or more polypeptide factors in a target cell. Non modified RNA is recognized as foreign by the cell s innate immune defenses against viral and bacterial RNA. If the cell transfected with non modified RNA is not induced to undergo apoptosis or to otherwise shut down protein synthesis by a first transfection event it will likely do so upon a subsequent transfection event with unmodified RNA.

The production of cells having an increased developmental potential e.g. iPS cells is generally achieved by the introduction of nucleic acid sequences specifically DNA encoding stem cell associated genes into an adult somatic cell. Historically these nucleic acids have been introduced using viral vectors and the expression of the gene products results in cells that are morphologically biochemically and functionally similar to pluripotent stem cells e.g. embryonic stem cells . This process of altering a cell phenotype from a somatic cell phenotype to a pluripotent stem cell phenotype is termed reprogramming. In the reprogramming methods described herein the reprogramming is achieved by repeated transfection with synthetic modified RNAs encoding the necessary reprogramming factors. The repeated transfection provides prolonged expression of the factors encoded by the synthetic modified RNAs necessary to shift the developmental potential of the cell.

Accordingly provided herein are pluripotent cells that are not embryonic stem cells and which were not induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors and which when subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis cluster more closely to embryonic stem cells than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors exogenous protein introduction of one or more reprogramming factors small molecule mediated expression or induction of one or more reprogramming factors or any combination thereof. In some aspects provided herein are pluripotent cells that are not embryonic stem cells and which were not induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. In such aspects the pluripotent cell subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis clusters more closely to a human embryonic stem cell than does a pluripotent cell induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. The pluripotent cell is generated from a precursor somatic cell such as a precursor human somatic cell. The pluripotent cell or its immediate precursor cell s can also be derived from a somatic cell partially reprogrammed somatic cell a pluripotent cell a multipotent cell a differentiated cell or an embryonic cell.

Reprogramming to generate pluripotent cells as described herein can be achieved by introducing a one or more synthetic modified RNAs encoding stem cell associated genes including for example Oct 4 also known as Oct 3 4 or Pouf51 SEQ ID NO 788 Sox1 Sox2 SEQ ID NO 941 or SEQ ID NO 1501 Sox3 Sox 15 Sox 18 NANOG Klf1 Klf2 Klf4 SEQ ID NO 501 Klf5 NR5A2 c Myc SEQ ID NO 636 1 Myc n Myc Rem2 Tert LIN28 SEQ ID NO 524 and Sal14. Accordingly in some embodiments the reprogramming factor is selected from the group consisting of OCT4 SOX1 SOX 2 SOX 3 SOX15 SOX 18 NANOG KLF1 KLF 2 KLF 4 KLF 5 NR5A2 c MYC 1 MYC n MYC REM2 TERT and LIN28. In general successful reprogramming is accomplished by introducing at least Oct 4 a member of the Sox family a member of the Klf family and a member of the Myc family to a somatic cell. In some embodiments LIN28 is also introduced. The generation of iPS cells using transfection of the synthetic modified RNAs described herein also referred to herein as RiPS from a variety of starting cell types including an adult somatic cell is demonstrated in the Examples herein. The generation of reprogrammed cells using the compositions and methods described herein preferably causes the induction of endogenous stem cell associated genes such as SOX2 REX1 DNMT3B TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 SSEA3 SSEA4 OCT4 and NANOG. In some embodiments at least two endogenous stem cell associated genes are induced. Preferably the endogenous expression is at a level comparable to an embryonic stem cell such as an embryonic stem cell cultured within the same laboratory.

The methods to reprogram cells using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein can involve repeated contacting of the cells such as somatic cells in order to permit sufficient expression of the encoded reprogramming factors to maintain a stable change in the developmental potential of the cells or progeny cells thereof being contacted. Such methods can involve repeated transfections such as for example at least two at least five at least 6 at least 7 at least 8 at least 9 at least 10 at least 11 at least 12 at least 13 at least 14 at least 15 at least 16 at least 17 at least 18 at least 19 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 or more transfections. In other words the methods comprise repeating transfection using the synthetic modified RNAs until a desired phenotype of the cell or population of cells is achieved. In some embodiments the methods further comprise contacting with or introducing the reprogramming factors to the cells under low oxygen conditions.

The efficiency of reprogramming i.e. the number of reprogrammed cells can be enhanced by the addition of various small molecules as shown by Shi Y. et al 2008 2 525 528 Huangfu D. et al 2008 26 7 795 797 and Marson A. et al 2008 3 132 135 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It is contemplated that the methods described herein can also be used in combination with a single small molecule or a combination of small molecules that enhances the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell production or replaces one or more reprogramming factors during the reprogramming process. Some non limiting examples of agents that enhance reprogramming efficiency include soluble Wnt Wnt conditioned media BIX 01294 a G9a histone methyltransferase PD0325901 a MEK inhibitor DNA methyltransferase inhibitors histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors valproic acid 5 azacytidine dexamethasone suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA and trichostatin TSA among others.

In some embodiments of the aspects described herein an inhibitor of p53 can be used to reduce the stress response during a reprogramming regimen to direct the cell fate away from an apoptotic stimulus and towards reprogramming. Thus treatment with a p53 inhibitor can enhance reprogramming in a population of cells. In one such embodiment the inhibitor of p53 comprises an siRNA directed against p53 that is administered or expressed in the reprogramming cell. In another embodiment a small molecule inhibitor of p53 e.g. pifithrin is administered to cells during the reprogramming process. In one embodiment a modified RNA encoding Bcl2 is administered to the cells prior to or in conjunction with a modified RNA composition encoding at least one reprogramming factor to prevent apoptosis of cells during the process of reprogramming.

To confirm the induction of pluripotent stem cells isolated clones can be tested for the expression of an endogenous stem cell marker. Such expression identifies the cells as induced pluripotent stem cells. Stem cell markers can be selected from the non limiting group including SSEA1 CD9 Nanog Fbx15 Ecat1 Esg1 Eras Gdf3 Fgf4 Cripto Dax1 Zpf296 Slc2a3 Rex1 Utf1 and Nat1. Methods for detecting the expression of such markers can include for example RT PCR and immunological methods that detect the presence of the encoded polypeptides. Further evidence of reprogramming is shown by a reduction in or the loss of lamin A C protein expression. Alternatively reprogramming is detected by measuring an increase in acetylation such as increased acetylation of H3 and H4 within the promoter of Oct4 or by measuring a decrease in methylation for example by measuring the demethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3. In each of these cases reprogramming is measured relative to a control cell. In other embodiments reprogramming is assayed by any other method that detects chromatin remodeling leading to the activation of an embryonic stem cell marker such as Oct4.

The pluripotent stem cell character of the isolated cells can be confirmed by any of a number of tests evaluating the expression of ES markers and the ability to differentiate to cells of each of the three germ layers. As one example teratoma formation in nude mice can be used to evaluate the pluripotent character of the isolated clones. The cells are introduced to nude mice and histology and or immunohistochemistry is performed on a tumor arising from the cells. The growth of a tumor comprising cells from all three germ layers further indicates that the cells are pluripotent stem cells.

The pluripotent cells generated using the compositions and methods comprising the synthetic modified RNAs described herein cluster more closely to a human embryonic stem cell than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors when subjected to an unsupervised hierarchical analysis i.e. the pluripotent cells have a phenotype closer to a embryonic stem cell phenotype than do pluripotent cells induced by viral expression of one or more reprogramming factors. In some embodiments the unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis is performed using a Euclidean distance with average linkage method in which the similarity metric for comparison between different cells is indicated on the height of cluster dendrogram. The unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed on any data set available to a skilled artisan such as gene expression data protein expression data DNA methylation data histone modification data and microRNA data.

Clustering including unsupervised clustering analysis or unsupervised cluster analysis refers to methods used in multivariate analysis to divide up objects into similar groups or in some embodiments groups whose members are all close to one another on various dimensions being measured in the various objects. A key component of the analysis is repeated calculation of distance measures between objects and between clusters once objects begin to be grouped into clusters. The outcome is typically represented graphically as a dendrogram. Hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed using any of a variety of unbiased computational methods algorithms and software programs known to one of skill in the art that identify clusters or natural data structures from large data sets such as for example gene expression data sets. Such methods include but are not limited to bottom up hierarchical clustering K means clustering Affinity Propagation non Negative Matrix Factorization spectral clustering Self Organizing Map SOM algorithms and the like. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein one SOM based method for use in unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of cells contacted with the synthetic modified RNAs described herein is the Automatic clustering using density equalized SOM Ensembles AUTOsome method as described in A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper 2010 Cell Stem Cell 7 258 262 and A. M. Newman and J. B. Cooper 2010 BMC Bioinformatics 2010 11 117 the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference.

Accordingly also provided herein are compositions for generating such pluripotent cells comprising at least one synthetic modified RNA encoding a reprogramming factor and cell growth media.

In preferred embodiments the synthetic modified RNAs comprise at least two nucleoside modifications preferably 5 methylcytidine 5mC and pseudouridine.

In some embodiments the compositions permit an efficiency of pluripotent cell generation from a starting population of cells such as somatic cells of at least 1 . In some embodiments the efficiency of pluripotent cell generation is at least 1.1 at least 1.2 at least 1.3 at least 1.4 at least 1.5 at least 1.6 at least 1.7 at least 1.8 at least 1.9 at least 2.0 at least 2.1 at least 2.2 at least 2.3 at least 2.4 at least 2.5 at least 2.6 at least 2.7 at least 2.8 at least 2.9 at least 3.0 at least 3.1 at least 3.2 at least 3.3 at least 3.4 at least 3.5 at least 3.6 at least 3.7 at least 3.8 at least 3.9 at least 4.0 at least 4.1 at least 4.2 at least 4.3 at least 4.4 at least 4.5 at least 4.6 at least 4.7 at least 4.8 at least 4.9 at least 5.0 5.1 at least 5.2 at least 5.3 at least 5.4 at least 5.5 at least 5.6 at least 5.7 at least 5.8 at least 5.9 at least 6.0 6.1 at least 6.2 at least 6.3 at least 6.4 at least 6.5 at least 6.6 at least 6.7 at least 6.8 at least 6.9 at least 7.0 7.1 at least 8.2 at least 8.3 at least 8.4 at least 8.5 at least 8.6 at least 8.7 at least 8.8 at least 8.9 at least 9.0 9.1 at least 9.2 at least 9.3 at least 9.4 at least 9.5 at least 1.6 at least 9.7 at least 9.8 at least 9.9 at least 10.0 or more.

In some embodiments the compositions permit a rate of pluripotent cell generation from a starting population of cells such as somatic cells of less than 25 days less than 24 days less than 23 days less than 22 days less than 21 days 20 days less than 19 days less than 18 days less than 17 days less than 16 days less than 15 days less than 14 days and greater than 7 days.

The reprogramming factor s for use in the compositions methods and kits for reprogramming cells described herein is selected from the group consisting of OCT4 SEQ ID NO 788 SOX1 SOX 2 SEQ ID NO 941 or SEQ ID NO 1501 SOX 3 SOX15 SOX 18 NANOG KLF1 KLF 2 KLF 4 SEQ ID NO 501 KLF 5 NR5A2 c MYC SEQ ID NO 636 1 MYC n MYC REM2 TERT and LIN28 SEQ ID NO 524 . In some embodiments the compositions comprise at least 4 synthetic modified RNAs encoding at least 4 different reprogramming factors. In some such embodiments the at least 4 different reprogramming factors encoded by the at least 4 modified synthetic RNAs comprise OCT4 SOX2 KLF4 and c MYC. The compositions can further comprise a modified synthetic RNA encoding a LIN28 reprogramming factor. In some embodiments the composition does not comprise a modified synthetic RNA encoding the reprogramming factor c MYC.

Transdifferentiation refers to a process by which the phenotype of a cell can be switched to that of another cell type without the formation of a pluripotent intermediate cell. Thus the methods do not require that the cell first be de differentiated or reprogrammed and then differentiated to another cell type rather the cell type is merely switched from one cell type to another without first forming a less differentiated phenotype. Thus transdifferentiation refers to the capacity of differentiated cells of one type to lose identifying characteristics and to change their phenotype to that of other fully differentiated cells.

Transdifferentiation can be achieved by introducing into a cell a synthetic modified RNA composition that permits expression of a cell type specific differentiation factor. For example to transdifferentiate a cell to a myogenic lineage one can express MyoD using a modified RNA as described herein. While the introduction of a single differentiation factor can be enough to transdifferentiate a cell it is also contemplated herein that a plurality of different differentiation factors are introduced to the cell during the transdifferentiation regime. Alternatively synthetic modified RNAs that inhibit expression of cell type specific polypeptides of the original cell type can also be introduced to the cell in effect turning off the original phenotype of the cell. In one embodiment modified RNAs that express a desired cell type specific polypeptide to turn on a desired phenotype are used in combination with modified RNA interference molecules used to turn off the existing cell phenotype in order to cause transdifferentiation of the cell from one phenotype to another.

Transdifferentiation can be useful in tissue engineering at e.g. an injury or disease site. In one embodiment transdifferentiation is performed in vivo at the site of injury or disease. In another embodiment an organ or tissue can be transdifferentiated regenerated in vitro and then introduced back into the body.

Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized uncommitted or less specialized cell acquires the features of a specialized cell e.g. a terminally differentiated cell such as for example a cardiomyocyte a nerve cell or a skeletal muscle cell. A differentiated or differentiation induced cell is one that has taken on a more specialized committed position within the lineage of a cell e.g. reduced differentiation potential . The term committed when applied to the process of differentiation refers to a cell that has proceeded in the differentiation pathway to a point where under normal circumstances it will continue to differentiate into a specific cell type or subset of cell types and cannot under normal circumstances differentiate into a different cell type or revert to a less differentiated cell type. De differentiation refers to the process by which a cell reverts to a less specialized or committed position within the lineage of a cell i.e. increased developmental potential . As used herein the lineage of a cell defines the heredity or fate of the cell i.e. which cells it came from and what cells it can give rise to. The lineage of a cell places the cell within a hereditary scheme of development and differentiation. A lineage specific marker refers to a characteristic specifically associated with the phenotype of cells of a lineage of interest and can be used to assess the differentiation of an uncommitted cell to the lineage of interest.

Cells that are differentiated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs as described herein can be differentiated into any cell type or lineage known to one of skill in the art. Such cells can be of a lineage selected from an ecotodermal lineage a mesodermal lineage or an endodermal lineage. Exemplary ectodermal lineage cells include but are not limited to cells of the epidermis skin cells melanocytes and cells of the neuronal lineage. Exemplary mesodermal lineage cells include but are not limited to cells of the circulatory system cardiac cells and blood vessel cells cells of the connective tissue bone cells dermal cells myocytes smooth and skeletal certain cells of the urinary system such as kidney cells splenic cells mesothelial cells cells of the peritoneum pleura and pericardium non germ cells of the reproductive system and hematopoietic lineage cells. Exemplary endodermal lineage cells include but are not limited to cells of the gastrointestinal system cells of the respiratory tract cells of the endocrine glands cells of the auditory system and certain cells of the urinary system such as the bladder and parts of the urethra.

Accordingly compositions and methods described herein include a method for programming or directing the differentiation of cells e.g. stem cells comprising contacting the cells desired to be differentiated with a synthetic modified RNA or synthetic modified RNA composition. The cells can be transfected a plurality of times until the desired differentiated phenotype is achieved as measured by e.g. a gene expression array of cell type specific markers Western blotting cell function assays etc. A selection compound may be added to the mixture but is not required.

Typically the synthetic modified RNA composition transfected into the cells to promote their differentiation encodes a cell type specific differentiation factor or factors. For example to differentiate a cell to a neuronal cell phenotype a synthetic modified RNA encoding at least one neuronal differentiation factor for example Ascl1 Brn2 Mytl1 or a combination thereof is transfected into the cell. To promote differentiation to a myogenic phenotype a synthetic modified RNA such as one encoding MyoD can be transfected into a cell. To differentiate a cell to a macrophage phenotype a macrophage factor such as e.g. CEBP alpha or PU.1 is transfected into the cell. In one embodiment a modified RNA that encodes Ngn3 Pdx1 MAFA or any combination thereof can be used to differentiate cells to a pancreatic beta cell phenotype. A synthetic modified RNA encoding PRDM16 can be applied to Myf5 expressing progenitors to induce differentiation into brown fat cells. Oligodendrocytes may be specified from neural precursors using a synthetic modified RNA encoding Ascl1. It has been reported that hepatocyte differentiation requires the transcription factor HNF 4 . Li et al. Genes Dev. 14 464 2000 . A synthetic modified RNA can be applied to a cell such as a stem cell or induced pluripotent stem cell generated using the compositions described herein that inhibit or suppress one or more component of the wnt catenin pathway to become a cardiovascular progenitor cell. These examples are not meant to be limiting and essentially any cell type specific factor or differentiation factor known in the art can be expressed in a cell using a synthetic modified RNA or synthetic modified RNA composition as described herein. Table 1 provides a non limiting list of exemplary transcription factors and corresponding mRNA sequence identifiers that can be used to alter the developmental potential or phenotype of a cell.

In other embodiments cells with higher or increased developmental potential e.g. pluripotent cells multipotent cells etc. can be induced to differentiate by manipulating their external environment. For example cells can be maintained under culture conditions that induce differentiation of the cells to a desired lineage. As but one example in some embodiments cells with higher or increased developmental potential generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be differentiated into islet like cells for administration to a patient in need thereof for example a patient having or at risk for diabetes. In such embodiments islet like cells which includes insulin producing cells and glucagon producing cells can be differentiated using any of the methods described in US Patent Publication No. 20100240130 the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. For example cells can be differentiated whereby the first culturing step takes place in the presence of an Activin the next culturing step utilizes a suspension culture that takes place in the presence of a noggin an FGF 2 and an EGF and a final culturing step in which the cells are cultured with nicotinamide. In certain embodiments sodium butyrate can be included in the culture medium. In other embodiments pluripotent cells can be differentiated into islet like cells by directed differentiation. In certain embodiments expression of additional genes at the site of islet like cell administration using the compositions and methods described herein can facilitate adoption of the functional islet cell phenotype enhance the beneficial effect of the administered cells and or increase proliferation and or activity of host cells neighboring the treatment site.

In other embodiments cells with higher or increased developmental potential generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be differentiated for example into neuronal cells such as oligodendrocytes for example for treatment of spinal cord injuries. In such embodiments pluripotent cells can be differentiated using any of the compositions or methods found in US Patent Publication No. 20090232779 or US Patent Publication No. 20090305405 the contents of each of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference. For example cells can be differentiated to neural or glial lineages using medium including any of the following factors in an effective combination Brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF neutrotrophin 3 NT 3 NT 4 epidermal growth factor EGF ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF nerve growth factor NGF retinoic acid RA sonic hedgehog FGF 8 ascorbic acid forskolin fetal bovine serum FBS and bone morphogenic proteins BMPs .

In other exemplary embodiments cells with higher or increased developmental potential generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be differentiated into heptaocyte like cells for treatment of liver diseases such as cirrhosis. For example cells can be differentiated to hepatocyte like cells using medium including any of the following factors in an effective combination or sequence a hepatocyte supportive extracellular matrix such as collagen or Matrigel suitable differentiation agents such as various isomers of butyrate and their analogs exemplified by n butyrate a hepatocyte maturation factor such as an organic solvent like dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO a maturation cofactor such as retinoic acid a cytokine or hormone such as a glucocorticoid epidermal growth factor EGF insulin transforming growth factors TGF and TGF fibroblast growth factors FGF heparin hepatocyte growth factors HGF interleukins IL 1 and IL 6 insulin like growth factors IGF I and IGF II and heparin binding growth factors HBGF 1 .

The success of a differentiation program can be monitored by any of a number of criteria including characterization of morphological features detection or quantitation of expressed cell markers and enzymatic activity and determination of the functional properties of the desired end cell types in vitro or in vivo. The level of mRNA corresponding to a marker can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats. The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include but are not limited to Southern or Northern analyses polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. Protein markers can be measured e.g. by immunohistochemical techniques or the morphology of the cell can be monitored. Biochemical approaches e.g. the ability of the differentiated cell to respond to a cell type specific stimulus can also be monitored. An increase in the expression of a cell specific marker may be by about 5 10 25 50 75 or 100 . In one embodiment the synthetic modified RNA composition can direct cell fate towards different germ layers without definitively specifying a terminally differentiated cell type. For example a synthetic modified RNA encoding Sox17 or GATA6 can be used for definitive endodermal specification from pluripotent cells such as an iPS or embryonic stem cell. Similarly a synthetic modified RNA encoding T Brachyury can be used for specification of mesoderm. For example markers for neural cells include but are not limited to tubulin III or neurofilament which are characteristic of neurons glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP present in astrocytes galactocerebroside GalC or myelin basic protein MBP characteristic of oligodendrocytes nestin characteristic of neural precursors and other cells and A2B5 and NCAM characteristic of glial progenitors and neural progenitors respectively. Similarly an adipocyte can be detected by assaying for Oil Red O staining or acetylated LDL uptake. Cardiomyocytes can be detected by assaying for the expression of one or more cardiomyocyte specific markers such as cardiotroponin I Mef2c connexin43 Nkx2.5 GATA 4 sarcomeric actinin cariotroponin T and TBX5 and sarcomeric actinin cardiac myosin heavy chain actin or ventricular myosin light chain 2 MLC 2v . For skeletal muscle markers include myoD myogenin and myf 5. Markers of interest for identifying liver cells include fetoprotein liver progenitors albumin antitrypsin glucose 6 phosphatase cytochrome p450 activity transferrin asialoglycoprotein receptor and glycogen storage hepatocytes CK7 CK19 and glutamyl transferase bile epithelium . The presence of endothelial cells can be detected by assaying the presence of an endothelial cell specific marker such as CD31 PECAM platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule Flk 1 tie 1 tie 2 vascular endothelial VE cadherin MECA 32 and MEC 14.7. For pancreatic cells pdx and insulin secretion can be used for determination of differentiation. The level of expression can be measured in a number of ways including but not limited to measuring the mRNA encoded by the markers measuring the amount of protein encoded by the markers or measuring the activity of the protein encoded by the markers.

In some embodiments differentiation is detected by measuring an alteration in the morphology or biological function or activity of a differentiated cell. An alteration in biological function may be assayed for example by measuring an increase in acetylated LDL uptake in a reprogrammed adipocyte. For example GABA secreting neurons can be identified by production of glutamic acid decarboxylase or GABA. Dopaminergic neurons can be identified by production of dopa decarboxylase dopamine or tyrosine hydroxylase. Also for example differentiated hepatocyte lineage cells differentiated can be identified by antitrypsin AAT synthesis albumin synthesis evidence of glycogen storage evidence of cytochrome p450 activity and evidence of glucose 6 phosphatase activity. Other methods for assaying cell morphology and function are known in the art and are described in the Examples.

In some embodiments the cells of the compositions and methods described herein are further cultured in the presence of cell specific growth factors such as angiogenin bone morphogenic protein 1 bone morphogenic protein 2 bone morphogenic protein 3 bone morphogenic protein 4 bone morphogenic protein 5 bone morphogenic protein 6 bone morphogenic protein 7 bone morphogenic protein 8 bone morphogenic protein 9 bone morphogenic protein 10 bone morphogenic protein 11 bone morphogenic protein 12 bone morphogenic protein 13 bone morphogenic protein 14 bone morphogenic protein 15 bone morphogenic protein receptor IA bone morphogenic protein receptor IB brain derived neurotrophic factor ciliary neutrophic factor ciliary neutrophic factor receptor alpha cytokine induced neutrophil chemotactic factor 1 cytokine induced neutrophil chemotactic factor 2 alpha cytokine induced neutrophil chemotactic factor 2 beta beta endothelial cell growth factor endothelia 1 epidermal growth factor epithelial derived neutrophil attractant fibroblast growth factor 4 fibroblast growth factor 5 fibroblast growth factor 6 fibroblast growth factor 7 fibroblast growth factor 8 fibroblast growth factor b fibroblast growth factor c fibroblast growth factor 9 fibroblast growth factor 10 fibroblast growth factor acidic fibroblast growth factor basic glial cell line derived neutrophil factor receptor alpha 1 glial cell line derived neutrophil factor receptor alpha 2 growth related protein growth related protein alpha growth related protein beta growth related protein gamma heparin binding epidermal growth factor hepatocyte growth factor hepatocyte growth factor receptor insulin like growth factor I insulin like growth factor receptor insulin like growth factor II insulin like growth factor binding protein keratinocyte growth factor leukemia inhibitory factor leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha nerve growth factor nerve growth factor receptor neurotrophin 3 neurotrophin 4 placenta growth factor placenta growth factor 2 platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor platelet derived growth factor platelet derived growth factor A chain platelet derived growth factor AA platelet derived growth factor AB platelet derived growth factor B chain platelet derived growth factor BB platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha platelet derived growth factor receptor beta pre B cell growth stimulating factor stem cell factor stem cell factor receptor transforming growth factor alpha transforming growth factor beta transforming growth factor beta 1 transforming growth factor beta 1 2 transforming growth factor beta 2 transforming growth factor beta 3 transforming growth factor beta 5 latent transforming growth factor beta 1 transforming growth factor beta binding protein I transforming growth factor beta binding protein II transforming growth factor beta binding protein III tumor necrosis factor receptor type I tumor necrosis factor receptor type II urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor vascular endothelial growth factor and chimeric proteins and biologically or immunologically active fragments thereof. Such factors can also be injected or otherwise administered directly into an animal system for in vivo integration.

In some aspects and embodiments of the aspects described herein a synthetic modified RNA can be used to express a ligand or ligand receptor on the surface of a cell e.g. a homing moiety . A ligand or ligand receptor moiety attached to a cell surface permits the cell to have a desired biological interaction with a tissue or an agent in vivo. A ligand can be an antibody an antibody fragment an aptamer a peptide a vitamin a carbohydrate a protein or polypeptide a receptor e.g. cell surface receptor an adhesion molecule a glycoprotein a sugar residue a therapeutic agent a drug a glycosaminoglycan or any combination thereof. For example a ligand can be an antibody that recognizes a cancer cell specific antigen rendering the cell capable of preferentially interacting with tumor cells to permit tumor specific localization of a modified cell. A ligand can confer the ability of a cell composition to accumulate in a tissue to be treated since a preferred ligand is capable of interacting with a target molecule on the external face of a tissue to be treated. Ligands having limited cross reactivity to other tissues are generally preferred.

In some cases a ligand can act as a homing moiety which permits the cell to target to a specific tissue or interact with a specific ligand. Such homing moieties can include for example any member of a specific binding pair antibodies monoclonal antibodies or derivatives or analogs thereof including without limitation Fv fragments single chain Fv scFv fragments Fab fragments F ab fragments single domain antibodies camelized antibodies and antibody fragments humanized antibodies and antibody fragments and multivalent versions of the foregoing multivalent binding reagents including without limitation monospecific or bispecific antibodies such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments scFv tandems scFv fragments diabodies tribodies or tetrabodies which typically are covalently linked or otherwise stabilized i.e. leucine zipper or helix stabilized scFv fragments and other homing moieties include for example aptamers receptors and fusion proteins.

In some embodiments the homing moiety is a surface bound antibody which can permit tuning of cell targeting specificity. This is especially useful since highly specific antibodies can be raised against an epitope of interest for the desired targeting site. In one embodiment multiple antibodies are expressed on the surface of a cell and each antibody can have a different specificity for a desired target. Such approaches can increase the avidity and specificity of homing interactions.

A skilled artisan can select any homing moiety based on the desired localization or function of the cell for example an estrogen receptor ligand such as tamoxifen can target cells to estrogen dependent breast cancer cells that have an increased number of estrogen receptors on the cell surface. Other non limiting examples of ligand receptor interactions include CCR1 e.g. for treatment of inflamed joint tissues or brain in rheumatoid arthritis and or multiple sclerosis CCR7 CCR8 e.g. targeting to lymph node tissue CCR6 CCR9 CCR10 e.g. to target to intestinal tissue CCR4 CCR10 e.g. for targeting to skin CXCR4 e.g. for general enhanced transmigration HCELL e.g. for treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders bone marrow Alpha4beta7 e.g. for intestinal mucosa targeting VLA 4 VCAM 1 e.g. targeting to endothelium . In general any receptor involved in targeting e.g. cancer metastasis can be harnessed for use in the methods and compositions described herein. Table 2 and Table 3 provide non limiting examples of CD cluster of differentiation molecules and other cell surface membrane bound molecules and receptors that can be expressed using the synthetic modified RNA compositions and methods described herein for targeting and homing to cells of interest or for changing the phenotype of a cell.

In one embodiment a synthetic modified RNA composition can be used to induce apoptosis in a cell e.g. a cancer cell by increasing the expression of a death receptor a death receptor ligand or a combination thereof. This method can be used to induce cell death in any desired cell and has particular usefulness in the treatment of cancer where cells escape natural apoptotic signals.

Apoptosis can be induced by multiple independent signaling pathways that converge upon a final effector mechanism consisting of multiple interactions between several death receptors and their ligands which belong to the tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor ligand superfamily. The best characterized death receptors are CD95 Fas TNFR1 p55 death receptor 3 DR3 or Apo3 TRAMO DR4 and DR5 apo2 TRAIL R2 . The final effector mechanism of apoptosis is the activation of a series of proteinases designated as caspases. The activation of these caspases results in the cleavage of a series of vital cellular proteins and cell death. The molecular mechanism of death receptors ligands induced apoptosis is well known in the art. For example Fas FasL mediated apoptosis is induced by binding of three FasL molecules which induces trimerization of Fas receptor via C terminus death domains DDs which in turn recruit an adapter protein FADD Fas associated protein with death domain and Caspase 8. The oligomerization of this trimolecular complex Fas FAIDD caspase 8 results in proteolytic cleavage of proenzyme caspase 8 into active caspase 8 that in turn initiates the apoptosis process by activating other downstream caspases through proteolysis including caspase 3. Death ligands in general are apoptotic when formed into trimers or higher order of structures. As monomers they may serve as antiapoptotic agents by competing with the trimers for binding to the death receptors.

In one embodiment the synthetic modified RNA composition encodes for a death receptor e.g. Fas TRAIL TRAMO TNFR TLR etc . Cells made to express a death receptor by transfection of modified RNA become susceptible to death induced by the ligand that activates that receptor. Similarly cells made to express a death ligand e.g. on their surface will induce death of cells with the receptor when the transfected cell contacts the target cell. In another embodiment the modified RNA composition encodes for a death receptor ligand e.g. FasL TNF etc . In another embodiment the modified RNA composition encodes a caspase e.g. caspase 3 caspase 8 caspase 9 etc . Where cancer cells often exhibit a failure to properly differentiate to a non proliferative or controlled proliferative form in another embodiment the synthetic modified RNA composition encodes for both a death receptor and its appropriate activating ligand. In another embodiment the synthetic modified RNA composition encodes for a differentiation factor that when expressed in the cancer cell such as a cancer stem cell will induce the cell to differentiate to a non pathogenic or non self renewing phenotype e.g. reduced cell growth rate reduced cell division etc or to induce the cell to enter a dormant cell phase e.g. Gresting phase .

One of skill in the art will appreciate that the use of apoptosis inducing techniques will require that the synthetic modified RNAs are appropriately targeted to e.g. tumor cells to prevent unwanted wide spread cell death. Thus one can use a delivery mechanism e.g. attached ligand or antibody targeted liposome etc that recognizes a cancer antigen such that the modified RNAs are expressed only in cancer cells.

The compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs are particularly useful for generating cells such as differentiated cells for use in patients in need of cellular therapies or regenerative medicine applications. Accordingly various embodiments of the methods and compositions described herein involve administration of an effective amount of a cell or a population of cells generated using any of the compositions or methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein to an individual or subject in need of a cellular therapy. The cell or population of cells being administered can be an autologous population or be derived from one or more heterologous sources. The cell can be for example a stem cell such as a lineage restricted progenitor cell multipotent cell or an oligopotent cell or a fully or partially differentiated progeny of a stem cell. In some embodiments the stem cell can be generated through the introduction of synthetic modified RNAs encoding differentiation factor s as described herein. In addition the population of cells administered can be of a lineage selected from one of an ecotodermal lineage a mesodermal lineage or an endodermal lineage. The cell can also be a cell modified to express a targeting moiety or a mediator of targeted cell death using synthetic modified RNAs as described herein. Further such differentiated cells can be administered in a manner that permits them to graft to the intended tissue site and reconstitute or regenerate the functionally deficient area. In some such embodiments differentiated cells can be introduced to a scaffold or other structure to generate for example a tissue ex vivo that can then be introduced to a patient. For example islet precursor cells or their derivatives can be generated to restore islet function in a patient having any condition relating to inadequate production of a pancreatic endocrine insulin glucagon or somatostatin or the inability to properly regulate secretion e.g. Type I insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

A variety of means for administering cells to subjects are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods can include systemic injection for example i.v. injection or implantation of cells into a target site in a subject. Cells may be inserted into a delivery device which facilitates introduction by injection or implantation into the subject. Such delivery devices can include tubes e.g. catheters for injecting cells and fluids into the body of a recipient subject. In one preferred embodiment the tubes additionally have a needle e.g. through which the cells can be introduced into the subject at a desired location. The cells can be prepared for delivery in a variety of different forms. For example the cells can be suspended in a solution or gel or embedded in a support matrix when contained in such a delivery device. Cells can be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in which the cells remain viable.

Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include saline aqueous buffer solutions solvents and or dispersion media. The use of such carriers and diluents is well known in the art. The solution is preferably sterile and fluid. Preferably prior to the introduction of cells as described herein the solution is stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi through the use of for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol ascorbic acid thimerosal and the like.

It is preferred that the mode of cell administration is relatively non invasive for example by intravenous injection pulmonary delivery through inhalation topical or intranasal administration. However the route of cell administration will depend on the tissue to be treated and may include implantation. Methods for cell delivery are known to those of skill in the art and can be extrapolated by one skilled in the art of medicine for use with the methods and compositions described herein.

Direct injection techniques for cell administration can also be used to stimulate transmigration of cells through the entire vasculature or to the vasculature of a particular organ such as for example liver or kidney or any other organ. This includes non specific targeting of the vasculature. One can target any organ by selecting a specific injection site e.g. a liver portal vein. Alternatively the injection can be performed systemically into any vein in the body. This method is useful for enhancing stem cell numbers in aging patients. In addition the cells can function to populate vacant stem cell niches or create new stem cells to replenish the organ thus improving organ function. For example cells may take up pericyte locations within the vasculature. In another example neural stem cells or precursor cells generated using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs are transplanted directly into parenchymal or intrathecal sites of the central nervous system according to the disease being treated such as for example a spinal cord injury. Grafts can be done using single cell suspension or small aggregates at a density of 25 000 500 000 cells per mL U.S. Pat. No. 5 968 829 the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference . A successful transplant can show for example transplant derived cells present in the lesion 2 5 weeks later differentiated into astrocytes oligodendrocytes and or neurons and migrating along the cord from the lesioned end.

If so desired a mammal or subject can be pre treated with an agent for example an agent is administered to enhance cell targeting to a tissue e.g. a homing factor and can be placed at that site to encourage cells to target the desired tissue. For example direct injection of homing factors into a tissue can be performed prior to systemic delivery of ligand targeted cells.

It is further contemplated that in some embodiments of these aspects cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein can not only be administered as cells in suspension but also as cells populating a matrix scaffold or other support to create an artificial tissue for use in cellular therapies in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

Tissue engineering refers to the use of a combination of cells engineering and materials methods and suitable biochemical and physio chemical factors for the de novo generation of tissue or tissue structures. Such engineered tissue or tissue structures are useful for therapeutic purposes to improve or replace biological functions. As used herein engineered tissue encompasses a broad range of applications including but not limited to utility in the repair or replace portions of or whole tissues e.g. heart cardiac tissue ventricular myocardium and other tissues such as bone cartilage pancreas liver kidney blood vessels bladder etc. or in assays for identifying agents which modify the function of parts of or entire organs without the need to obtain such organs from a subject.

In some embodiments a support i.e. any suitable carrier material to which cells generated using the methods and compositions comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein are able to attach themselves or adhere is used in order to form a corresponding cell composite e.g. an artificial tissue. In some embodiments a matrix or carrier material respectively is present already in a three dimensional form desired for later application. For example bovine pericardial tissue can be used as matrix which is crosslinked with collagen decellularized and photofixed.

In some such embodiments a scaffold which can also be referred to as a biocompatible substrate can be used as a material that is suitable for implantation into a subject onto which a cell population can be deposited. A biocompatible substrate does not cause toxic or injurious effects once implanted in the subject. In one embodiment the biocompatible substrate is a polymer with a surface that can be shaped into a desired structure that requires repairing or replacing. The polymer can also be shaped into a part of a structure that requires repairing or replacing. The biocompatible substrate provides the supportive framework that allows cells to attach to it and grow on it. Cultured populations of cells can then be grown on the biocompatible substrate which provides the appropriate interstitial distances required for cell cell interaction.

A structure or scaffold can be used to aid in further controlling and directing a cell or population of cells undergoing differentiation or transdifferentiation using the compositions and methods described herein. A structure or scaffold such as a biopolymer structure can be designed to provide environmental cues to control and direct the differentiation of cells to a functionally active engineered tissue e.g. multipotent cells undergoing differentiation using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein into ventricular cardiomyocytes to generate a functional contracting tissue myocardium structure. By functionally active it is meant that the cell attached to the scaffold comprises at least one function of that cell type in its native environment. A structure or scaffold can be engineered from a nanometer to micrometer to millimeter to macroscopic length and can further comprise or be based on factors such as but not limited to material mechanical properties material solubility spatial patterning of bioactive compounds spatial patterning of topological features soluble bioactive compounds mechanical perturbation cyclical or static strain stress shear etc. . . . electrical stimulation and thermal perturbation.

The construction of an engineered tissue can be carried out by first assembling the scaffolds and then seeding with a cell type that has undergone differentiation or partial differentiation using the synthetic modified RNA compositions and methods described herein. Alternatively an engineered tissue can be made by seeding a matrix or other scaffold component cell with cells such as iPS cells or human ES cells and applying or introducing a desired synthetic modified RNA composition directly to the scaffold comprising the cells. A scaffold can be in any desired geometric conformation for example a flat sheet a spiral a cone a v like structure and the like. A scaffold can be shaped into e.g. a heart valve vessel tubular planar construct or any other suitable shape. Such scaffold constructs are known in the art see e.g. WO02 035992 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 479 064 6 461 628 the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference . In some embodiments after culturing the cells on the scaffold the scaffold is removed e.g. bioabsorbed or physically removed and the layers of differentiation or transdifferentiated cells maintain substantially the same conformation as the scaffold such that for example if the scaffold was spiral shaped the cells form a 3D engineered tissue that is spiral shaped. In addition it is contemplated that different synthetic modified RNA compositions can be contacted with or applied to a scaffold comprising cells in order to allow the growth and differentiation of a plurality of different differentiated cells types to form a desired engineered tissue. For example for construction of muscle tissue with blood vessels a scaffold can be seeded with different population of cells which make up blood vessels neural tissue cartilage tendons ligaments and the like.

Biopolymer structures can be generated by providing a transitional polymer on a substrate depositing a biopolymer on the transitional polymer shaping the biopolymer into a structure having a selected pattern on the transitional polymer poly N Isopropylacrylamide and releasing the biopolymer from the transitional polymer with the biopolymer s structure and integrity intact. A biopolymer can be selected from an extracellular matrix ECM protein growth factor lipid fatty acid steroid sugar and other biologically active carbohydrates a biologically derived homopolymer nucleic acids hormone enzyme pharmaceutical composition cell surface ligand and receptor cytoskeletal filament motor protein silks polyprotein e.g. poly lysine or any combination thereof. The biopolymers used in the generation of the scaffolds for the embodiments directed to tissue engineering described herein include but are not limited to a extracellular matrix proteins to direct cell adhesion and function e.g. collagen fibronectin laminin etc. b growth factors to direct cell function specific to cell type e.g. nerve growth factor bone morphogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor etc. c lipids fatty acids and steroids e.g. glycerides non glycerides saturated and unsaturated fatty acids cholesterol corticosteroids sex steroids etc. d sugars and other biologically active carbohydrates e.g. monosaccharides oligosaccharides sucrose glucose glycogen etc. e combinations of carbohydrates lipids and or proteins such as proteoglycans protein cores with attached side chains of chondroitin sulfate dermatan sulfate heparin heparan sulfate and or keratan sulfate glycoproteins e.g. selectins immunoglobulins hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin Alpha fetoprotein and Erythropoietin EPO etc. proteolipids e.g. N myristoylated palmitoylated and prenylated proteins and glycolipids e.g. glycoglycerolipids glycosphingolipids glycophosphatidylinositols etc. f biologically derived homopolymers such as polylactic and polyglycolic acids and poly L lysine g nucleic acids e.g. DNA RNA etc. h hormones e.g. anabolic steroids sex hormones insulin angiotensin etc. i enzymes types oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases ligases examples trypsin collegenases matrix metallproteinases etc. j pharmaceuticals e.g. beta blockers vasodilators vasoconstrictors pain relievers gene therapy viral vectors anti inflammatories etc. k cell surface ligands and receptors e.g. integrins selectins cadherins etc. l cytoskeletal filaments and or motor proteins e.g. intermediate filaments microtubules actin filaments dynein kinesin myosin etc. or any combination thereof. For example a biopolymer can be selected from the group consisting of fibronectin vitronectin laminin collagen fibrinogen silk or silk fibroin.

Following or during construction of a biopolymer scaffold cells can be integrated into or onto the scaffold. In some embodiments the cells to be differentiated are human ES derived cells or iPS derived cells and the methods further comprise growing the cells in the scaffold where the structure composition ECM type growth factors and or other cell types can assist in differentiation of the cells into the desired differentiated cell type. In some embodiments such engineered tissue can be further used in drug screening applications. For example an engineered myocardium tissue composition can be useful as a tool to identify agents which modify the function of cardiac muscle e.g. to identify cardiotoxic agents .

A wide range of diseases are recognized as being treatable with cellular therapies. Accordingly also provided herein are compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs for generating cells for use in cellular therapies such as stem cell therapies. As non limiting examples these include diseases marked by a failure of naturally occurring stem cells such as aplastic anemia Fanconi anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria PNH . Others include for example acute leukemias including acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL acute myelogenous leukemia AML acute biphenotypic leukemia and acute undifferentiated leukemia chronic leukemias including chronic myelogenous leukemia CML chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia JCML and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML myeloproliferative disorders including acute myelofibrosis angiogenic myeloid metaplasia myelofibrosis polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia lysosomal storage diseases including mucopolysaccharidoses MPS Hurler s syndrome MPS 1H Scheie syndrome MPS IS Hunter s syndrome MPS II Sanfilippo syndrome MPS III Morquio syndrome MPS IV Maroteaux Lamy Syndrome MPS VI Sly syndrome beta glucuronidase deficiency MPS VII adrenoleukodystrophy mucolipidosis II I cell Disease Krabbe disease Gaucher s disease Niemann Pick disease Wolman disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy histiocytic disorders including familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis histiocytosis X and hemophagocytosis phagocyte disorders including Chediak Higashi syndrome chronic granulomatous disease neutrophil actin deficiency and reticular dysgenesis inherited platelet abnormalities including amegakaryocytosis congenital thrombocytopenia plasma cell disorders including multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia and Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia. Other malignancies treatable with stem cell therapies include but are not limited to breast cancer Ewing sarcoma neuroblastoma and renal cell carcinoma among others. Also treatable with stem cell therapy are lung disorders including COPD and bronchial asthma congenital immune disorders including ataxia telangiectasia Kostmann syndrome leukocyte adhesion deficiency DiGeorge syndrome bare lymphocyte syndrome Omenn s syndrome severe combined immunodeficiency SCID SCID with adenosine deaminase deficiency absence of T B cells SCID absence of T cells normal B cell SCID common variable immunodeficiency and X linked lymphoproliferative disorder other inherited disorders including Lesch Nyhan syndrome cartilage hair hypoplasia Glanzmann thrombasthenia and osteopetrosis neurological conditions including acute and chronic stroke traumatic brain injury cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epilepsy cardiac conditions including atherosclerosis congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction metabolic disorders including diabetes and ocular disorders including macular degeneration and optic atrophy. Such diseases or disorders can be treated either by administration of stem cells themselves permitting in vivo differentiation to the desired cell type with or without the administration of agents to promote the desired differentiation or by administering stem cells differentiated to the desired cell type in vitro. Efficacy of treatment is determined by a statistically significant change in one or more indicia of the targeted disease or disorder.

Dosage and administration will vary with the condition to be treated and the therapeutic approach taken in a given instance.

Depending on the disease or disorder being treated and on the approach being taken cells over a range of for example 2 5 10 or more e.g. 1 10 1 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 5 10or more can be administered. Where differentiated cells are to be administered the dose will most often be higher than where stem cells are administered because differentiated cells will have reduced or limited capacity for self renewal compared to stem cells. Repeat administration of differentiated cells may be necessary if the cells are not capable of self renewal.

It is contemplated that cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation can be administered as cells in suspension or as cells populating a matrix scaffold or other support to create an artificial tissue. To this end resorbable matrices and scaffolds are known in the art as are approaches for populating them with cells as has been described herein. As but one example matrices fabricated out of silk proteins are well suited as supports for cells and are known to be well tolerated for implantation. Cells as described herein can be seeded on such matrices either alone or in combination with other cells including autologous cells from the intended recipient to provide the necessary environment for growth and maintenance of the cells in the desired differentiated or non differentiated state. It is also contemplated that the cells generated by differentiation or transdifferentiation can be administered to a subject in need thereof in an encapsulated form according to known encapsulation technologies including microencapsulation see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 352 883 4 353 888 and 5 084 350 which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference . Where the differentiated or transdifferentiated cells are encapsulated in some embodiments the cells are encapsulated by macroencapsulation as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 284 761 5 158 881 4 976 859 4 968 733 5 800 828 and published PCT patent application WO 95 05452 which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. In such embodiments cells on the order of 1 10 1 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 5 10or more can be administered alone or on a matrix or support.

In other embodiments cells can be suspended in a gel for administration to keep them relatively localized.

The success of treatment can be evaluated by the ordinarily skilled clinician by monitoring one or more symptoms or markers of the disease or disorder being treated by administration of the cells. Effective treatment includes any statistically significant improvement in one or more indicia of the disease or disorder. Where appropriate a clinically accepted grade or scaling system for the given disease or disorder can be applied with an improvement in the scale or grade being indicative of effective treatment.

In those aspects and embodiments where synthetic modified RNAs are to be administered directly instead of cells treated with or resulting from treatment with synthetic modified RNA the dosages will also vary depending upon the approach taken the mode of delivery and the disease to be treated. For example systemic administration without a targeting approach will generally require greater amounts of synthetic modified RNA than either local administration or administration that employs a targeting or homing approach. Depending upon the targeted cell or tissue and the mode of delivery effective dosages of synthetic modified RNA can include for example 1 ng kg of body weight up to a gram or more per kg of body weight and any amount in between. Preferred amounts can be for example in the range of 5 g kg body weight to 30 g kg of body weight or any amount in between. Dosages in such ranges can be administered once twice three times four times or more per day or every two days every three days every four days once a week twice a month once a month or less frequently over a duration of days weeks or months depending on the condition being treated where the therapeutic approach treats or ameliorates but does not permanently cure the disease or disorder e.g. where the synthetic modified RNA effects treatment of a metabolic disorder by expression of a protein that is deficient in the subject administration of modified RNA can be repeated over time as needed. Where instead the synthetic modified RNA leads to the establishment of a cell compartment that maintains itself and treats the disease or disorder readministration may become unnecessary. Sustained release formulations of synthetic modified RNA compositions are specifically contemplated herein. Continuous relatively low doses are contemplated after an initial higher therapeutic dose.

A pharmaceutical composition that includes at least one synthetic modified RNA described herein can be delivered to or administered to a subject by a variety of routes depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Exemplary routes include parenteral intrathecal parenchymal intravenous nasal oral and ocular delivery routes. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip subcutaneous intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or intrathecal or intraventricular administration. A synthetic modified RNA can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. For example compositions can include one or more synthetic modified RNAs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. Compositions for intrathecal or intraventricular administration of synthetic modified RNAs can include sterile aqueous solutions that can also contain buffers diluents and other suitable additives.

In some embodiments the effective dose of a synthetic modified RNA can be administered in a single dose or in two or more doses as desired or considered appropriate under the specific circumstances. If desired to facilitate repeated or frequent infusions a non implantable delivery device e.g. needle syringe pen device or implantatable delivery device e.g. a pump semi permanent stent e.g. intravenous intraperitoneal intracisternal or intracapsular or reservoir can be advisable. In some such embodiments the delivery device can include a mechanism to dispense a unit dose of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA. In some embodiments the device releases the pharmaceutical composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA continuously e.g. by diffusion. In some embodiments the device can include a sensor that monitors a parameter within a subject. For example the device can include pump e.g. and optionally associated electronics. Exemplary devices include stents catheters pumps artificial organs or organ components e.g. artificial heart a heart valve etc. and sutures.

As used herein topical delivery can refer to the direct application of a synthetic modified RNA to any surface of the body including the eye a mucous membrane surfaces of a body cavity or to any internal surface. Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches ointments lotions creams gels drops sprays and liquids. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers aqueous powder or oily bases thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Topical administration can also be used as a means to selectively deliver the synthetic modified RNA to the epidermis or dermis of a subject or to specific strata thereof or to an underlying tissue.

Formulations for parenteral administration can include sterile aqueous solutions which can also contain buffers diluents and other suitable additives. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter for example attached to a reservoir. For intravenous use the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic.

A synthetic modified RNA can be administered to a subject by pulmonary delivery. Pulmonary delivery compositions can be delivered by inhalation by the patient of a dispersion so that the composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA within the dispersion can reach the lung where it can be readily absorbed through the alveolar region directly into the lung cells to directly transfect the lung cells and or enter the blood circulation. Direct transfection by inhalation will allow expression of a desired protein for example CFTR by the transfected lung cells. Accordingly pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic delivery and for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lungs. Pulmonary delivery can be achieved by different approaches including the use of nebulized aerosolized micellular and dry powder based formulations of the compositions comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein. Delivery can be achieved with liquid nebulizers aerosol based inhalers and dry powder dispersion devices. Metered dose devices are preferred. One of the benefits of using an atomizer or inhaler is that the potential for contamination is minimized because the devices are self contained. Dry powder dispersion devices for example deliver drugs that can be readily formulated as dry powders. A synthetic modified RNA composition can be stably stored as lyophilized or spray dried powders by itself or in combination with suitable powder carriers. The delivery of a composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA for inhalation can be mediated by a dosing timing element which can include a timer a dose counter time measuring device or a time indicator which when incorporated into the device enables dose tracking compliance monitoring and or dose triggering to a patient during administration of the aerosol medicament.

A synthetic modified RNA can be modified such that it is capable of traversing the blood brain barrier. For example the synthetic modified RNA can be conjugated to a molecule that enables the agent to traverse the barrier. Such conjugated synthetic modified RNA can be administered by any desired method such as by intraventricular or intramuscular injection or by pulmonary delivery for example.

A composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA described herein can also be delivered through the use of implanted indwelling catheters that provide a means for injecting small volumes of fluid containing the synthetic modified RNAs described herein directly into local tissues. The proximal end of these catheters can be connected to an implanted access port surgically affixed to the patient s body or to an implanted drug pump located in for example the patient s torso.

Alternatively implantable delivery devices such as an implantable pump can be employed. Examples of the delivery devices for use with the compositions comprising a synthetic modified RNA described herein include the Model 8506 investigational device by Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis Minn. which can be implanted subcutaneously in the body or on the cranium and provides an access port through which therapeutic agents can be delivered. In addition to the aforementioned device the delivery of the compositions comprising a synthetic modified RNA described herein can be accomplished with a wide variety of devices including but not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 735 814 5 814 014 and 6 042 579 all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Using the teachings described herein those of skill in the art will recognize that these and other devices and systems can be suitable for delivery of compositions comprising the synthetic modified RNAs described herein.

In some such embodiments the delivery system further comprises implanting a pump outside the body the pump coupled to a proximal end of the catheter and operating the pump to deliver the predetermined dosage of a composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA described herein through the discharge portion of the catheter. A further embodiment comprises periodically refreshing a supply of the composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA to the pump outside the body.

A synthetic modified RNA can be administered ocularly such as to treat retinal disorders e.g. a retinopathy. For example the pharmaceutical compositions can be applied to the surface of the eye or nearby tissue e.g. the inside of the eyelid. They can be applied topically e.g. by spraying in drops as an eyewash or an ointment. Ointments or droppable liquids can be delivered by ocular delivery systems known in the art such as applicators or eye droppers. Such compositions can include mucomimetics such as hyaluronic acid chondroitin sulfate hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or poly vinyl alcohol preservatives such as sorbic acid EDTA or benzylchronium chloride and the usual quantities of diluents and or carriers. The pharmaceutical composition can also be administered to the interior of the eye and can be introduced by a needle or other delivery device which can introduce it to a selected area or structure. The composition containing the synthetic modified RNA can also be applied via an ocular patch.

A synthetic modified RNA can be administered by an oral or nasal delivery. For example drugs administered through these membranes have a rapid onset of action provide therapeutic plasma levels avoid first pass effect of hepatic metabolism and avoid exposure of the drug to the hostile gastrointestinal GI environment. Additional advantages include easy access to the membrane sites so that the drug can be applied localized and removed easily.

Administration of a composition comprising a synthetic modified RNA can be provided by the subject or by another person e.g. a another caregiver. A caregiver can be any entity involved with providing care to the human for example a hospital hospice doctor s office outpatient clinic a healthcare worker such as a doctor nurse or other practitioner or a spouse or guardian such as a parent. The medication can be provided in measured doses or in a dispenser which delivers a metered dose.

Where cells expressing proteins encoded by synthetic modified RNA as described herein are administered to treat a malignancy or disease or disorder the dose of cells administered will also vary with the therapeutic approach. For example where the cell expresses a death ligand targeting the tumor cell the dosage of cells administered will vary with the mode of their administration e.g. local or systemic smaller doses are required for local and with the size of the tumor being treated generally more cells or more frequent administration is warranted for larger tumors versus smaller ones. The amount of cells administered will also vary with the level of expression of the polypeptide or polypeptides encoded by the modified RNA this is equally true of the administration of cells expressing proteins encoded by modified RNA for any purpose described herein. An important advantage of the methods described herein is that where for example more than one factor or polypeptide is expressed from a modified RNA introduced to a cell the relative dosage of the expressed proteins can be tuned in a straightforward manner by adjusting the relative amounts of the modified RNAs introduced to the cell or subject. This is in contrast to the difficulty of tuning the expression of even a single gene product in a cell transduced with a viral or even a plasmid vector.

Therapeutic compositions containing at least one synthetic modified NA can be conventionally administered in a unit dose. The term unit dose when used in reference to a therapeutic composition refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required physiologically acceptable diluent i.e. carrier or vehicle.

The compositions are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered and timing depends on the subject to be treated capacity of the subject s system to utilize the active ingredient and degree of therapeutic effect desired.

The present invention involves therapeutic compositions useful for practicing the therapeutic methods described herein. Therapeutic compositions contain a physiologically tolerable carrier together with an active compound synthetic modified RNA a cell transfected with a synthetic modified RNA or a cell differentiated de differentiated or transdifferentiated with a synthetic modified RNA as described herein dissolved or dispersed therein as an active ingredient. In a preferred embodiment the therapeutic composition is not immunogenic when administered to a mammal or human patient for therapeutic purposes unless so desired. As used herein the terms pharmaceutically acceptable physiologically tolerable and grammatical variations thereof as they refer to compositions carriers diluents and reagents are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable or unacceptable physiological effects such as toxicity nausea dizziness gastric upset immune reaction and the like. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will not promote the raising of an immune response to an agent with which it is admixed unless so desired. The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Typically such compositions are prepared as injectable either as liquid solutions or suspensions however particularly where synthetic modified RNA itself is administered solid forms suitable for solution or suspensions in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified or presented as a liposome composition. The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. Suitable excipients are for example water saline dextrose glycerol ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition if desired the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value physiological saline or both such as phosphate buffered saline. Saline based carriers are most useful for the administration of cells or cell preparations. Still further aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides dextrose polyethylene glycol and other solutes.

The ability to safely and efficiently reprogram differentiate transdifferentiate cells using the synthetic modified RNAs compositions and methods thereof described herein as well as generate engineered tissues using such cells compositions and methods has high applicability for use in high throughput screening technologies of disease model systems and assays for the characterization of candidate agents for identifying novel agents for use in the treatment of human disease. Such screening methods and platforms can be used for example to identify novel agents for treating a desired disorder to identify novel agents involved in reprogramming and differentiation and or alteration maintenance of developmental states or to identify effects of a candidate agent on one or more parameters of a particular cell type or engineered tissue generated using the compositions and methods described herein. Characterization of candidate agents can include aspects such as compound development identifying cell specific toxicity and cell specific survival and assessments of compound safety compound efficacy and dose response parameters. For example an engineered myocardium tissue can be contacted with a test agent and the effect if any of the test agent on a parameter such as an electrophysiological parameter associated with normal or abnormal myocardium function such as contractibility including frequency and force of contraction can be determined or e.g. whether the agent has a cardiotoxic effect.

The drug discovery process is time consuming and costly in part owing to the high rate of attrition of compounds in clinical trials. Thus modifications and alternative platforms that could accelerate the advancement of promising drug candidates or reduce the likelihood of failure would be extremely valuable. High throughput screening technologies refer to the platforms and assays used to rapidly test thousands of compounds. For example reporter systems used in cell lines can be used to assess whether compounds activate particular signaling pathways of interest.

The compositions and methods using synthetic modified RNAs for reprogramming differentiating and transdifferentiating cells as well as generating engineered tissues described herein provide a reliable source of cells that can be generated and expanded in an efficient manner to quantities necessary for drug screening and toxicology studies. Further because the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein minimize the cellular interferon responses and do not result in permanent genome modifications the effects of a candidate agent can be studied with minimal confounding factors. As has been described herein cells can be differentiated to generate specific cell types for example neurons blood cells pancreatic islet cells muscle cells and cardiomyocytes and induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from patients with specific diseases such as for example a patient with cystic fibrosis as demonstrated herein.

One particular advantage of cells and engineered tissues generated using the compositions methods and kits comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein for use in screening platforms is that from a single and potentially limitless starting source most of the major cells within the human body that could be affected by a drug or other agent can be produced. Such cells provide a better predictive model of both drug efficacy and toxicity than rodent cell lines or immortalized human cell lines that are currently used in high throughput screens. While such immortalized cell and animal models have contributed a wealth of information about the complexity of various disease processes compounds that show a significant benefit in such models can fail to show effectiveness in clinical trials. For example use of a transgenic mouse that overexpresses mutant superoxide dismutase SOD a gene found to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis enabled the identification of several compounds that alter disease characteristics including vitamin E and creatine. However when these compounds were tested in humans no clinical improvements were observed A. D. Ebert and C. N. Svendsen Human stem cells and drug screening opportunities and challenges. 2010 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9 p. 1 6 . Furthermore toxic effects of compounds are often missed in cell and animal models due to specific interactions with human biological processes that cannot be recapitulated in these systems.

Accordingly in some aspects the compositions comprising synthetic modified RNAs and the methods described herein can be used for evaluating the effects of novel candidate agents and compounds on specific human cell types that are relevant to drug toxicity effects. In some embodiments cells can be induced to undergo differentiation to a particular cell type or tissue using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein that the test drug or compound is discovered or known to affect and then used for performing dose response toxicity studies. In such embodiments human stem cells such as iPS cells derived from patients can be exposed to appropriate differentiation factors using the compositions and methods comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein and instructed to form the various cell types found in the human body which could then be useful for assessing multiple cellular parameters and characteristics upon exposure to a candidate agent or compound. For example the cells could be used to assess the effects of drug candidates on functional cardiomyocytes or on cardiomyocytes having a specific genetic mutation because drug development is often stalled by adverse cardiac effects. Thus measurable disruption of electrophysiological properties by known and novel agents and compounds can be assessed in a clinically relevant consistent and renewable cell source. Also for example such cells can be used to identify metabolic biomarkers in neural tissues derived from human stem cells after toxin exposure. Such embodiments allow potentially toxic compounds to be eliminated at an early stage of the drug discovery process allowing efforts to be directed to more promising candidates. As another example islet cells generated using the methods and compositions comprising synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be used to screen candidate agents such as solvents small molecule drugs peptides polynucleotides or environmental conditions such as culture conditions or manipulation that affect the characteristics of islet precursor cells and their various progeny. For example islet cell clusters or homogeneous cell preparations can be tested for the effect of candidate agents such as small molecule drugs that have the potential to up or down regulate insulin synthesis or secretion. The cells are combined with the candidate agent and then monitored for change in expression or secretion rate of insulin using for example RT PCR or immunoassay of the culture medium.

In other aspects the compositions comprising synthetic modified RNAs and the methods thereof described herein are used in differentiation screens i.e. for identifying compounds that increase self renewal or differentiation promote maturation or enhance cell survival of cells such as stem cells differentiated cells or cancer cells.

In other aspects the compositions comprising the synthetic modified RNAs and the methods thereof described herein can be used to screen for drugs that may correct an observed disease phenotype. In such aspects cells can be expanded differentiated into the desired cell type using synthetic modified RNAs and then used to screen for drugs that may correct the observed disease phenotype. A candidate agent or drug can be used to directly contact the surface of a reprogrammed differentiated transdifferentiated cell population or engineered tissue by applying the candidate agent to a media surrounding the cell or engineered tissue. Alternatively a candidate agent can be intracellular as a result of introduction of the candidate agent into a cell.

As used herein cellular parameters refer to quantifiable components of cells or engineered tissues particularly components that can be accurately measured most desirably in a high throughput system. A cellular parameter can be any measurable parameter related to a phenotype function or behavior of a cell or engineered tissue. Such cellular parameters include changes in characteristics and markers of a cell or cell population including but not limited to changes in viability cell growth expression of one or more or a combination of markers such as cell surface determinants such as receptors proteins including conformational or posttranslational modification thereof lipids carbohydrates organic or inorganic molecules nucleic acids e.g. mRNA DNA global gene expression patterns etc. Such cellular parameters can be measured using any of a variety of assays known to one of skill in the art. For example viability and cell growth can be measured by assays such as Trypan blue exclusion CFSE dilution and H incorporation. Expression of protein or polyeptide markers can be measured for example using flow cytometric assays Western blot techniques or microscopy methods. Gene expression profiles can be assayed for example using microarray methodologies and quantitative or semi quantitative real time PCR assays. A cellular parameter can also refer to a functional parameter such as a metabolic parameter e.g. expression or secretion of a hormone such as insulin or glucagon or an enzyme such as carboxypeptidase an electrophysiological parameter e.g. contractibility such as frequency and force of mechanical contraction of a muscle cell action potentials conduction such as conduction velocity or an immunomodulatory parameter e.g. expression or secretion of a cytokine or chemokine such as an interferon or an interleukin expression or secretion of an antibody expression or secretion of a cytotoxin such as perforin a granzyme and granulysin and phagocytosis .

In certain embodiments the candidate agent is a small molecule having a chemical moiety. Such chemical moieties can include for example unsubstituted or substituted alkyl aromatic or heterocyclyl moieties and typically include at least an amine carbonyl hydroxyl or carboxyl group frequently at least two of the functional chemical groups including macrolides leptomycins and related natural products or analogues thereof. Candidate agents can be known to have a desired activity and or property or can be selected from a library of diverse compounds.

Also included as candidate agents are pharmacologically active drugs genetically active molecules etc. Such candidate agents of interest include for example chemotherapeutic agents hormones or hormone antagonists growth factors or recombinant growth factors and fragments and variants thereof.

Essentially any polypeptide can be expressed using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein. Polypeptides useful with the methods described herein include but are not limited to transcription factors targeting moieties and other cell surface polypeptides cell type specific polypeptides differentiation factors death receptors death receptor ligands reprogramming factors and or de differentiation factors.

In some embodiments a synthetic modified RNA or composition thereof encodes for a transcription factor. As used herein the term transcription factor refers to a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences and thereby controls the transfer or transcription of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. In one embodiment the transcription factor encoded by the synthetic modified RNA is a human transcription factor such as those described in e.g. Messina D M et al. 2004 14 10B 2041 2047 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Some non limiting examples of human transcription factors and their mRNA IDs and sequence identifiers for use in the aspects and embodiments described herein include those listed herein in Table 1 SEQ ID NOs 1 1428 and 1483 1501 .

The FOXP3 forkhead box P3 gene encodes for a protein involved in immune system responses. A member of the FOX protein family FOXP3 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the development and function of regulatory T cells. The induction or administration of Foxp3 positive T cells in animal studies indicate marked reductions in autoimmune disease severity in models of diabetes multiple sclerosis asthma inflammatory bowel disease thyroiditis and renal disease.

As used herein the term targeting moiety refers to an agent that directs a composition to a particular tissue cell type receptor or other area of interest. As per this definition a targeting moiety can be attached directly to a synthetic modified RNA or indirectly to a composition used for delivering a synthetic modified RNA e.g. a liposome polymer etc to direct expression in a particular cell etc. A targeting moiety can also be encoded or expressed by a synthetic modified NA as described herein such that a cell expresses a targeting moiety on it surface permitting a cell to be targeted to a desired tissue organ etc. For the avoidance of confusion targeting moieties expressed on a cell surface are referred to herein as homing moieties. 

Non limiting examples of a targeting moiety or homing moiety include but are not limited to an oligonucleotide an antigen an antibody or functional fragment thereof a ligand a cell surface receptor a membrane bound molecule one member of a specific binding pair a polyamide including a peptide having affinity for a biological receptor an oligosaccharide a polysaccharide a steroid or steroid derivative a hormone e.g. estradiol or histamine a hormone mimic e.g. morphine or hormone receptor or other compound having binding specificity for a target. In the methods of the present invention a targeting moiety promotes transport or preferential localization of a synthetic modified RNA to a target cell while a homing moiety permits the targeting of a cell modified using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein to a particular tissue in vivo. It is contemplated herein that the homing moiety can be also encoded in a cell by a synthetic modified RNA as described herein.

A synthetic modified RNA or composition thereof can be targeted by means of a targeting moiety including e.g. an antibody or targeted liposome technology. In some embodiments a synthetic modified RNA or composition thereof is targeted to a specific tissue by using bispecific antibodies for example produced by chemical linkage of an anti ligand antibody Ab and an Ab directed toward a specific target. To avoid the limitations of chemical conjugates molecular conjugates of antibodies can be used for production of recombinant bispecific single chain Abs directing ligands and or chimeric inhibitors at cell surface molecules. The addition of an antibody to a synthetic modified RNA composition permits the agent attached to accumulate additively at the desired target site. Antibody based or non antibody based targeting moieties can be employed to deliver a ligand or the inhibitor to a target site. Preferably a natural binding agent for an unregulated or disease associated antigen is used for this purpose.

Table 2 and Table 3 provide non limiting examples of CD cluster of differentiation molecules and other cell surface membrane bound molecules and receptors such as transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors ABC transporters and integrins that can be expressed using the synthetic modified RNA compositions and methods described herein for targeting and homing to cells of interest or for changing the phenotype of a cell.

As used herein the term cell type specific polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that is expressed in a cell having a particular phenotype e.g. a muscle cell but is not generally expressed in other cell types with different phenotypes. For example MyoD is expressed specifically in muscle cells but not in non muscle cells thus MyoD is a cell type specific polypeptide. As another example albumin is expressed in hepatocytes and is thus an hepatocyte specific polypeptide.

Such cell specific polypeptides are well known in the art or can be found using a gene array analysis and comparison of at least two different cell types. Methods for gene expressional array analysis is well known in the art.

Differentiation factors reprogramming factors and transdifferentiation factors are further discussed herein in their appropriate sub sections.

By death receptor is meant a receptor that induces cellular apoptosis once bound by a ligand. Death receptors include for example tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor superfamily members having death domains e.g. TNFR1 Fas DR3 4 5 6 and TNF receptor superfamily members without death domains LTbetaR CD40 CD27 HVEM. Death receptors and death receptor ligands are well known in the art or are discussed herein.

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein can encode for death receptors to be expressed on the surface of a cell to enhance the vulnerability of a cell to apoptosis. The death ligand can also be encoded or can be provided e.g. at a tumor site. This is particularly useful in the treatment of cancer where cells evade apoptosis and continue to divide. Alternatively the synthetic modified RNAs or compositions thereof can encode for a death receptor ligand which will induce apoptosis in cells that express a cell surface death receptor and can increase the efficiency of programmed cell death in targeted cells of a subject.

Some non limiting examples of death receptors include FAS CD95 Apo1 TNFR1 p55 CD120a DR3 Apo3 WSL 1 TRAMP LARD DR4 DR5 Apo2 TRAIL R2 TRICK2 KILLER CAR1 and the adaptor molecules FADD TRADD and DAXX. Some non limiting examples of death receptor ligands include FASL CD95L TNF lymphotoxin alpha Apo3L TWEAK and TRAIL Apo2L .

The synthetic modified RNAs described herein can be used to express a mitogen receptor on a cell surface. Activation of a mitogen receptor with the mitogen induces cell growth and or differentiation of the cell.

Mitogen receptors include those that bind ligands including but not limited to insulin insulin like growth factor e.g. IGF1 IGF2 platelet derived growth factor PDGF epidermal growth factor EGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF nerve growth factor NGF fibroblast growth factor FGF bone morphogenic proteins BMPs granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF hepatocyte growth factor HGF transforming growth factor TGF alpha and beta among others.

In addition cytokines that promote cell growth can also be encoded by synthetic modified RNAs herein. For example cytokines such as erythropoietin thrombopoietin and other cytokines from the IL 2 sub family tend to induce cell proliferation and growth.

Synthetic modified RNAs as described herein can also be used to express protein therapeutically in cells by either administration of a synthetic modified RNA composition to an individual or by administering a synthetic modified RNA to cells that are then introduced to an individual. In one aspect cells can be transfected with a modified RNA to express a therapeutic protein using an ex vivo approach in which cells are removed from a patient transfected by e.g. electroporation or lipofection and re introduced to the patient. Continuous or prolonged administration in this manner can be achieved by electroporation of blood cells that are re infused to the patient.

Some exemplary protein therapeutics include but are not limited to insulin growth hormone erythropoietin granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF thrombopoietin clotting factor VII Factor IX interferon glucocerebrosidase anti HER2 monoclonal antibody and Etanercept among others.

Currently clinical applications using induced pluripotent stem iPS cells are impeded by low efficiency of iPS derivation and the use of protocols that permanently modify the genome to effect cellular reprogramming. Moreover safe reliable and effective means of directing the fate of patient specific iPS cells towards clinically useful cell types are lacking. Described herein are novel non mutagenic strategies for altering cellular phenotypes such as reprogramming cell fate based on the administration of synthetic modified mRNAs that are modified to overcome innate cellular anti viral responses. The compositions and approaches described herein can be used to reprogram multiple human cell types to pluripotency with surprising and unexpected efficiencies that greatly surpass established protocols. Also described herein are novel compositions and methods for directing the fate of cells towards clinically useful cell types and a non limiting example that demonstrates that this technology can be used to efficiently direct the differentiation of RNA induced pluripotent stem RiPS cells into terminally differentiated myogenic cells. Thus the compositions and methods described herein represent safe highly efficient strategies for altering cellular developmental potentials such as somatic cell reprogramming and directing differentiated cell fates that have broad applicability for basic research disease modeling and regenerative and personalized medicine.

ORF PCRs were templated from plasmids bearing human KLF4 c MYC OCT4 SOX2 human ES cDNA LIN28 Clontech pIRES eGFP eGFP pRVGP d2eGFP and CMV MyoD from Addgene. The ORF of the low stability nuclear GFP was constructed by combining the d2eGFP ORF with a 3 nuclear localization sequence. PCR reactions were performed using HiFi Hotstart KAPA Biosystems Woburn Mass. per the manufacturer s instructions. Splint mediated ligations were carried out using Ampligase Thermostable DNA Ligase Epicenter Biotechnologies Madison Wis. . UTR ligations were conducted in the presence of 200 nM UTR oligos and 100 nM splint oligos using 5 cycles of the following annealing profile 95 C. for 10 seconds 45 C. for 1 minute 50 C. for 1 minute 55 C. for 1 minute 60 C. for 1 minute. A phosphorylated forward primer was employed in the ORF PCRs to facilitate ligation of the top strand to the 5 UTR fragment. The 3 UTR fragment was also 5 phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase New England Biolabs Ipswich Mass. . All intermediate PCR and ligation products were purified using QIAquick spin columns Qiagen Valencia Calif. before further processing.

5 and 3 UTR oligos are ligated to the top strand of gene specific ORF amplicons to produce a basic template construct for cloning. Underlined bases in the 5 UTR oligo sequence indicate the upstream T7 promoter and in the 3 UTR oligo sequence show downstream restriction sites introduced to facilitate linearization of template plasmids. Template PCR primers are used to amplify ligation products for sub cloning. Tail PCR primers are used to append an oligo dT sequence immediately after the 3 UTR to drive templated addition of a poly A tail during IVT reactions. Gene specific ORF primers are used to capture the coding region minus the start codon from cDNA templates. Splint oligos mediate ligation of UTR oligos to the top strand of ORF amplicons.

Thus far the reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotency shows great utility as a tool for studying normal cellular development while also having the potential for generating patient specific induced pluripotent stem iPS cells that can be used to model disease or to generate clinically useful cell types for autologous therapies aimed at repairing deficits arising from injury illness and aging. Induction of pluripotency was originally achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues by enforced expression of four transcription factors KLF4 c MYC OCT4 and SOX2 KMOS using retroviral vectors Takahashi et al. 2007 Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006 .

A formidable obstacle to therapeutic use of iPS cells has been presented by the requirement for viral integration into the genome. The search for ways to induce pluripotency without incurring genetic change has become the focus of intense research effort. Towards this end attempts to derive iPS cells using excisable lentiviral and transposon vectors or through repeated application of transient plasmid episomal and adenovirus vectors have been made Chang et al. 2009 Kaji et al. 2009 Okita et al. 2008 Stadtfeld et al. 2008 Woltjen et al. 2009 Yu et al. 2009 . Human iPS cells have also been derived using two DNA free methods serial protein transduction with recombinant proteins incorporating cell penetrating peptide moieties Kim et al. 2009 Zhou et al. 2009 and transgene delivery using the Sendai virus which has a completely RNA based reproductive cycle Fusaki et al. 2009 .

Considerable limitations accompany the non integrative iPS derivation strategies devised thus far. For example DNA transfection based methodologies still entail risk of genomic recombination or insertional mutagenesis even though they are supposedly safer than viral based delivery methods. In the protein based strategies thus far derived the recombinant proteins used are difficult and challenging to generate and purify in the quantities required and result in even lower efficiencies of pluripotent stem cell generation that conventional viral based methods Zhou et al. 2009 . Use of Sendai virus requires stringent steps to purge reprogrammed cells of replicating virus and the sensitivity of the viral RNA replicase to transgene sequence content can further limit the generality of this reprogramming vehicle Fusaki et al. 2009 . Importantly the methods discussed that rely on repeat administration of transient vectors whether DNA or protein based have shown very low reprogramming and iPS derivation efficiencies Jia et al. 2010 Kim et al. 2009 Okita et al. 2008 Stadtfeld et al. 2008 Yu et al. 2009 Zhou et al. 2009 presumably due without wishing to be bound or limited by theory to weak or inconstant expression of reprogramming factors.

As demonstrated herein the inventors have discovered and shown that repeated administration of synthetic modified messenger RNAs that incorporate novel modifications designed to bypass innate cellular anti viral responses can reprogram differentiated human cells to pluripotency with conversion efficiencies and kinetics vastly and unexpectedly superior to established protein and viral based protocols. Accordingly described herein are methods and compositions demonstrating that this non mutagenic efficient and highly controllable technology is applicable to a wide range of cellular engineering tasks involving altering cellular developmental potentials such as the reprogramming of differentiated cells and the differentiation of reprogrammed cells to a differentiated cell type such as RNA iPS RiPS derived fibroblasts to terminally differentiated myogenic cells.

mRNA was manufactured using in vitro transcription IVT reactions templated by PCR amplicons . To promote efficient translation and boost RNA half life in the cytoplasm a 5 guanine cap was incorporated by inclusion of a synthetic cap analog in the IVT reactions Yisraeli et al. 1989 . Within the IVT templates described herein the open reading frame ORF of the gene of interest is flanked by a 5 untranslated region UTR containing a strong Kozak translational initiation signal and an alpha globin 3 UTR terminating with an oligo dT sequence for templated addition of a polyA tail.

Cytosolic delivery of mRNA into mammalian cells can be achieved using electroporation or by complexing the RNA with a cationic vehicle to facilitate uptake by endocytosis Audouy and Hoekstra 2001 Elango et al. 2005 Holtkamp et al. 2006 Van den Bosch et al. 2006 Van Tendeloo et al. 2001 . The latter approach was utilized by the inventors as it would allow for repeated transfection to sustain ectopic protein expression over the days to weeks required for cellular reprogramming. In experiments in which synthetic RNA encoding GFP was transfected into murine embryonic fibroblasts and human epidermal keratinocytes high dose dependent cytotoxicity was noted which was not attributable to the cationic vehicle and which was exacerbated on repeated transfections. These experiments demonstrated a serious impediment to achieving sustained protein expression by repeated mRNA transfection.

It is has been reported that exogenous single stranded RNA ssRNA activates antiviral defenses in mammalian cells through interferon and NF B dependent pathways Diebold et al. 2004 Hornung et al. 2006 Kawai and Akira 2007 Pichlmair et al. 2006 Uematsu and Akira 2007 . In order to increase the sustainability of RNA mediated protein expression approaches were sought to reduce the immunogenic profile of the synthetic RNA. The co transcriptional capping technique yields a significant fraction of uncapped IVT product bearing 5 triphosphates which has been reported to trigger the ssRNA sensor RIG I Hornung et al. 2006 Pichlmair et al. 2006 and have also been reported to activate PKR a global repressor of cellular protein translation Nallagatla and Bevilacqua 2008 . However treatment of the synthesized RNA with a phosphatase only resulted in modest reductions in the observed cytotoxicity upon repeated transfections.

Eukaryotic mRNA is extensively modified in vivo and the presence of modified nucleobases has been shown to reduce signaling by RIG I and PKR as well as by the less widely expressed but inducible endosomal ssRNA sensors TLR7 and TLR8 Kariko et al. 2005 Kariko et al. 2008 Kariko and Weissman 2007 Nallagatla and Bevilacqua 2008 Nallagatla et al. 2008 Uzri and Gehrke 2009 . In an attempt to further reduce innate immune responses to transfected RNA mRNAs were synthesized incorporating modified ribonucleoside bases. Complete substitution of either 5 methylcytidine 5mC for cytidine or pseudouridine psi for uridine in GFP encoding transcripts markedly improved viability and increased ectopic protein expression.

However the most significant improvements in viability and protein expression were observed when both 5 methylcytidine and pseudouridine were used together . It was discovered that these modifications dramatically attenuated interferon signaling as revealed by qRT PCR for a panel of interferon response genes although residual upregulation of some interferon targets was still detected . Innate cellular anti viral defenses can self prime through a positive feedback loop involving autocrine and paracrine signaling by Type I interferons Randall and Goodbourn 2008 . It was found that media supplementation with a recombinant version of B18R protein a Vaccinia virus decoy receptor for Type I interferons Symons et al. 1995 further increased cellular viability following RNA transfection especially in some cell types. It was discovered that synthesis of RNA with a combination of both modified 5 methylcytidine and pseudouridine ribonucleotides and phosphatase treatment herein termed synthetic modified RNAs combined with media supplementation with the interferon inhibitor B18R allowed high dose dependent levels of protein expression .

It was discovered that transfection of synthetic modified RNA encoding GFP into six different human cell types resulted in highly penetrant expression 50 90 positive cells and demonstrated the applicability of these novel methods and compositions to diverse cell types . Simultaneous delivery of synthetic modified RNAs encoding cytosolic localized red and nuclear localized green fluorescent proteins into keratinocytes revealed that generalized co expression of multiple proteins could be achieved in mammalian cells and that the resulting proteins were correctly localized to the cytosol and nucleus respectively .

Ectopic protein expression after RNA transfection is transient owing to RNA and protein degradation and the diluting effect of cell division. To establish the kinetics and persistence of protein expression synthetic modified RNA encoding GFP variants designed for high and low protein stability Li et al. 1998 were synthesized and transfected into keratinocytes. Time course analysis by flow cytometry showed that protein expression persisted for several days for the high stability variant but peaked within 12 hours and decayed rapidly thereafter for the destabilized GFP . These results indicated that a repetitive transfection regimen would be necessary in order to sustain high levels of ectopic expression for short lived proteins over an extended time course.

To assess this and further address the impact of repeated RNA transfection on cell growth and viability BJ fibroblasts were transfected daily for 10 days with either unmodified or synthetic modified RNAs encoding GFP. It was discovered that daily transfection with synthetic modified RNA permitted sustained protein expression without substantially compromising the viability of the culture beyond a modest reduction in growth kinetics that was attributable to the transfection reagent vehicle . Microarray analysis established that prolonged daily transfection with synthetic modified RNA did not significantly alter the molecular profile of the transfected cells although a modest upregulation of a number of interferon response genes was noted consistent with the fact that the modifications described herein did not completely abrogate interferon signaling . In complete contrast repeated transfections with unmodified RNA severely compromised the growth and viability of the culture through in part elicitation of a massive interferon response demonstrating that the use of unmodified RNA is not a viable strategy for sustaining long term polypeptide expression in cells .

To determine if modified RNAs could be used to directly alter cell fate synthetic modified RNA was synthesized encoding the myogenic transcription factor MYOD Davis et al. 1987 and transfected into murine C3H10T1 2 cells over the course of 3 days followed by continued culturing in a low serum media for an additional 3 days. The emergence of large multi nucleated myotubes that stained positive for the myogenic markers myogenin and myosin heavy chain MyHC provided proof that transfection with synthetic modified RNAs could be utilized to efficiently direct cell fate .

The determination of whether induced pluripotent stem cells iPS could be derived using synthetic modified RNAs was next attempted. To this end synthetic modified RNAs encoding the four canonical Yamanaka factors KLF4 K c MYC M OCT4 O and SOX2 S were synthesized transfected into cells. It was discovered that the synthetic modified RNAs encoding transcription factors yielded robust protein expression that localized to the nucleus . Time course analysis monitored by flow cytometry yielded expression kinetics and stability similar to destabilized GFP demonstrating rapid turnover of these transcription factors . From this it was concluded that daily transfections would be required to maintain sufficient expression of the Yamanaka factors during long term multi factor reprogramming regimens.

A protocol to ensure sustained high level protein expression with daily transfection was next discovered by exploring a matrix of conditions encompassing a variety of different transfection reagents culture media feeder cell types and RNA doses. Long term reprogramming experiments were initiated with human ES derived dH1f fibroblasts which display relatively efficient viral mediated iPS cell conversion Chan et al. 2009 Park et al. 2008 . Low oxygen 5 O2 culture conditions and a KMOS stoichiometry of 1 1 3 1 were also employed as these have been reported to promote efficient iPS conversion in viral based methods Kawamura et al. 2009 Papapetrou et al. 2009 Utikal et al. 2009 Yoshida et al. 2009 . Synthetic modified RNA encoding a short half life nuclear GFP was spiked into the KMOS RNA cocktail to allow visualization of continued protein expression from modified RNA during the course of the experiment . Experiments conducted in this manner revealed widespread transformation of fibroblast morphology to a compact epithelioid morphology within the first week of synthetic modified RNA transfection which was followed by emergence of canonical hES like colonies with tight morphology well defined borders and prominent nucleoli . RNA transfection was terminated on day 17 and three days later colonies were mechanically picked and expanded to establish 14 prospective iPS lines designated dH1f RiPS RNA derived iPS 1 14.

It was next attempted to reprogram somatically derived cells to pluripotency using a similar reprogramming regimen. A five factor cocktail including a modified RNA encoding LIN28 KMOSL Yu et al. 2007 was employed and the media was supplemented with valproic acid VPA a histone deacetylase inhibitor which has been reported to increase reprogramming efficiency Huangfu et al. 2008 . Four human cell types were tested Detroit 551 D551 and MRC 5 fetal fibroblasts BJ post natal fibroblasts and fibroblast like cells cultured from a primary skin biopsy taken from an adult cystic fibrosis patient CF cells . Daily transfection with the modified RNA KMOSL cocktail gave rise to numerous hES like colonies in the D551 BJ and CF cultures that were mechanically picked at day 18 while MRC 5 derived colonies were picked at day 25. Multiple RiPS colonies were expanded for each of the somatic lines and immunostaining confirmed the expression of hES markers TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 SSEA3 SSEA4 OCT4 and NANOG in all the RiPS lines examined . Three RiPS cell clones from each of these four derivations were analyzed and confirmed to originate from the seeded somatic cells by DNA fingerprinting and all presented normal karyotypes. In the experiments described above the transfected fibroblast cultures were passaged once at an early time point day 6 or 7 in order to promote fibroblast proliferation which has been shown to facilitate reprogramming Hanna et al. 2009 . However in independent experiments RiPS cells were also derived from BJ and Detroit 551 fibroblasts in the absence of cell passaging indicating that this was not required for modified RNA iPS derivation .

A number of molecular and functional assays were performed to assess whether the RiPS cells described herein had been reprogrammed to pluripotency Table 6 . Multiple RiPS lines derived from each of the five starting cell types were evaluated by quantitative RT PCR qRT PCR and all demonstrated robust expression of the pluripotency associated transcripts OCT4 SOX2 NANOG and hTERT . RiPS clones derived from dH1f MRC5 BJ and CF fibroblasts were further analyzed by bisulfite sequencing which revealed extensive demethylation of the OCT4 locus relative to the parental fibroblasts an epigenetic state equivalent to human ES cells .

To gain more global insight into the molecular properties of RiPS cells gene expression profiles of RiPS clones from multiple independent derivations were generated and compared to fibroblasts human embryonic stem ES cells and virally derived iPS cell lines. These analyses revealed that all synthetic modified RNA derived iPS clones examined had a molecular signature that very closely recapitulated that of human ES cells while being highly divergent from the profile of the parental fibroblasts . Importantly pluripotency associated transcripts including SOX2 REX1 NANOG OCT4 LIN28 and DNMT3B were substantially upregulated in the RiPS cells compared to the parental fibroblast lines to levels comparable to human ES cells . Furthermore when the transcriptional profiles were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis all RiPS clones analyzed clustered more closely to human ES cells than did virally derived iPS cells indicating that synthetic modified RNA derived iPS cells more fully recapitulated the molecular signature of human ES cells .

To evaluate the developmental potential of RiPS cells embryoid bodies EBs were generated from multiple clones representing five independent RiPS derivations. Beating cardiomyocytes were observed for vast majority of the EBs Table 6 . Mesodermal potential was further evaluated in methylcellulose assays which showed that all lines tested were able to differentiate into hematopoietic precursors capable of giving rise to colony numbers and a spectrum of blood colony types comparable to human ES cells Table 6 . A subset of clones was further plated onto matrigel and differentiated into Tuj1 positive neurons ectoderm and alpha fetoprotein positive endodermal cells Table 6 . Finally tri lineage differentiation potential was confirmed in vivo by the formation of teratomas from dH1F CF and BJ RiPS cells that histologically revealed cell types of the three germ layers Table 6 .

Taken together these data demonstrate by the most stringent molecular and functional criteria available in regard to human pluripotent cells Chan et al. 2009 Smith et al. 2009 that the synthetic modified RNA derived iPS clones from multiple independent derivations described herein were reprogrammed to pluripotency and closely recapitulated the functional and molecular properties of human ES cells. Significantly these synthetic modified RNA derived iPS clones had molecular properties more similar to human ES cells than did cells that were reprogrammed using standard viral based methods.

During the course of the experiments surprisingly high reprogramming efficiencies and rapid kinetics of iPS cell generation using the synthetic modified RNAs described herein were observed. To quantify the efficiency of RiPS derivation more thoroughly a number of reprogramming experiments were undertaken and results quantitated based on the expression of the iPS specific markers TRA 1 60 and TRA 1 81 Chan et al. 2009 Lowry et al. 2008 . In one set of experiments BJ fibroblasts transfected with a five factor modified RNA cocktail KMOSL this time without the use of VPA demonstrated an iPS conversion efficiency of over 2 which is two orders of magnitude higher than typically reported for virus based derivations Table 7 . Moreover in contrast to virus mediated BJ iPS derivations in which iPS colonies typically take around 4 weeks to emerge by day 17 of RNA transfection the plates had already become overgrown with ES like colonies .

In another set of experiments the contributions of low oxygen culture and LIN28 to the efficiency of RiPS derivation were evaluated. The yield of TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 positive colonies in the ambient 20 oxygen condition was four fold lower than in the cultures maintained at 5 O2 when using KMOS RNA but this deficit was negated when LIN28 was added to the cocktail Table 7 . The highest conversion efficiency 4.4 which is higher than any reported conversion efficiency was observed when low oxygen culture and the five factor KMOSL cocktail were combined.

To directly compare the kinetics and efficiency of the RiPS derivation protocol against an established viral protocol an experiment in which dH1f fibroblasts were transfected with KMOS synthetic modified RNAs or transduced with KMOS retroviruses in parallel was conducted. As had been observed in the previous experiments described herein ES like colonies began to emerge by day 13 from the synthetic modified RNA transfected cultures and the plates became overgrown with ES like colonies by the 16th and final day of transfection. These synthetic modified RNA derived cultures were therefore fixed for analysis on day 18 . Notably at this time no ES like colonies had appeared in the retrovirally transduced cultures and colonies only began to emerge on the 24th day post transduction which is a time point consistent with previous reports describing iPS derivations by retroviruses Lowry et al. 2008 Takahashi et al. 2007 . These retroviral derived cultures were fixed for analysis on day 32. Both arms of the experiment were then immunostained and TRA 1 60 positive colonies were counted. These experiments revealed that the kinetics of modified RNA iPS derivation were almost twice as fast as retroviral iPS derivation. Further and importantly iPS derivation efficiencies were 1.4 for synthetic modified RNA cultures and only 0.04 for retroviral cultures corresponding to a surprising 36 fold higher conversion efficiency with the synthetic modified RNA compositions and protocols Table 7 . Thus by the combined criteria of colony numbers and kinetics of reprogramming the efficiency of synthetic modified RNA iPS derivation greatly exceeds that of conventional retroviral approaches.

Utilization of Synthetic Modified RNA to Direct Differentiation of Pluripotent Rips Cells to a Terminally Differentiated Cell Fate.

To realize the promise of iPS cell technology for regenerative medicine or disease modeling it is imperative that the multi lineage differentiation potential of pluripotent cells be harnessed. Although limited progress has been made in directing the differentiation of pluripotent ES cells to various lineages by modulating the extracellular cytokine milieu such protocols remain inefficient. Given the high efficiency of iPS derivation by the novel synthetic modified RNAs and methods thereof described herein whether this technology could also be utilized to redirect pluripotent or multipotent cells towards differentiated cell fates was also determined. To test this one of the validated RIPS lines described herein was subjected to an in vitro differentiation protocol in which FGF was withdrawn serum added and the cells plated onto gelatin . Cells obtained under these conditions were subjected to three consecutive days of transfection with a MYOD encoding synthetic modified RNA to provoke myogenic differentiation. The cells were then cultured an additional three days and then immunostained for the myogenic markers myogenin and MyHC which revealed a high percentage of large multi nucleated myogenin and MyHC double positive myotubes .

Taken together the experiments described herein provide clear proof that synthetic modified RNAs can be used to both reprogram cells to a pluripotent state at high and unexpected efficiencies and also direct the fate of such cells and other pluripotent or multipotent cells to cells having lower developmental potential such as a terminally differentiated somatic cell type.

Described herein are novel compositions and technologies that use a combination of synthetic RNA modifications and in some embodiments a soluble interferon inhibitor to overcome innate anti viral responses and permit repeated transfections with RNA thus enabling highly efficient alterations in cellular phenotypes and developmental potentials such as highly efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency and directing the differentiation of pluripotent cells towards a desired lineage. The novel methodologies and compositions described herein offer several key advantages over established reprogramming techniques. By obviating the need to perform experiments under stringent biological containment synthetic modified RNA technology makes reprogramming accessible to a wider community of researchers. More fundamentally the approaches described herein allow protein stoichiometry to be regulated globally within cultures while avoiding the stochastic variation of expression typical of integrating vectors as well as the uncontrollable and undesired effects of viral silencing. Given the stepwise character of the phenotypic changes observed during pluripotency induction Chan et al. 2009 Smith et al. 2010 individual transcription factors can play distinct stage specific roles during reprogramming. The unprecedented potential for temporal control over factor expression afforded by the technologies described herein can help researchers unravel these nuances yielding further insights that can be applied to further enhance the efficiency and kinetics of reprogramming.

While the risk of mutagenesis is a major safety concern holding back clinical exploitation of induced pluripotency other factors also play a role. It has become increasingly apparent that all iPS cells are not created equal with respect to epigenetic landscape and developmental plasticity Hu et al. 2010 Miura et al. 2009 . In this regard the most stringent molecular and functional criteria for reprogramming human cells have been applied herein Chan et al. 2009 Smith et al. 2009 to demonstrate that the iPS clones derived from synthetic modified RNAs from multiple independent derivations were reprogrammed to pluripotency and also closely recapitulated the functional and molecular properties of human ES cells. Significantly as described herein synthetic modified RNA derived iPS cells more faithfully recapitulated the global transcriptional signature of human ES cells than retrovirally derived iPS cells indicating that the compositions and methods for RNA reprogramming described herein produce higher quality iPS cells possibly owing without wishing to be bound or limited by theory to the fact that they are transgene free.

The transient and non mutagenic character of RNA based protein expression can also deliver important clinical benefits in some embodiments outside the domain of lineage reprogramming and alteration of cellular developmental potential. The use of RNA transfection to express cancer or pathogen antigens for immunotherapy is already an active research area Rabinovich et al. 2008 Rabinovich et al. 2006 Van den Bosch et al. 2006 Weissman et al. 2000 and the synthetic modified RNA can be used in some embodiments to transiently express surface proteins such as homing receptors to target cellular therapies toward specific organs tissues or diseased cells Ryser et al. 2008 .

For tissue engineering to progress further there is a pressing need for safe and efficient means to alter cellular fates. In terms of personalized medicine applications iPS cells are a starting point for patient specific therapies and specification of clinically useful cell types is required to produce autologous tissues for transplantation or for disease modeling. Importantly the inventors have demonstrated that the synthetic modified RNA based technologies described herein that enable highly efficient reprogramming can are equally applicable to efficiently alter pluripotent cell fate to terminally differentiated fates without compromising genomic integrity. In light of these considerations the novel compositions and approaches described herein can become central enabling technology for cell based therapies and regenerative medicine.
