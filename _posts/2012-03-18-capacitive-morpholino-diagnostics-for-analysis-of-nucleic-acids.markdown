title: Capacitive morpholino diagnostics for analysis of nucleic acids
abstract: Use of Morpholinos, a class of uncharged DNA analogues, for surface-hybridization applications. Monolayers of Morpholino probes on gold supports are fabricated with methods similar to those employed with DNA, and are used to hybridize efficiently and sequence-specifically with target strands. Hybridization-induced changes in the interfacial charge organization are analyzed with electrochemical methods and compared for Morpholino and DNA probe monolayers. Molecular mechanisms connecting surface hybridization state to the interfacial capacitance are identified and interpreted through comparison to numerical Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Positive as well as negative capacitive responses (contrast inversion) to hybridization are possible, depending on surface populations of mobile ions as controlled by the applied potential. Quantitative comparison of surface capacitance with target coverage (targets/area) reveals a near-linear relationship, and demonstrates sensitivities (limits of quantification) in the pg mmrange.

This invention relates generally to nucleic acid analysis and more specifically to the label free DNA analysis by surface hybridization to morpholine monolayers.

Surface hybridization in which sequence specific binding between polynucleic acid probes on a solid support and complementary targets from solution occurs at a solid liquid interface was introduced as a diagnostic method in the 1960 s. The technique continues to be widely exploited in modern DNA microarray and biosensor technologies for genotyping transcriptome profiling genetic identification and related diagnostic applications. When hybridization occurs at a surface experiments show that the phenomenology of the reaction is more complex than in solution. The crowded interfacial environment is characterized by nucleotide concentrations that approach the molar range and the resultant amplification of interactions between nucleotides can have a dramatic impact on physical behavior manifesting for example in suppressed binding affinities orders of magnitude lower than those in solution.

A consequence of molecular crowding is that a DNA probe layer presents a high 0.1 mol Lconcentration of immobilized negative charge. This charge density erects an electrostatic barrier to entry of like charged would be hybridization partners from solution. In order for hybridization to proceed this barrier needs to be screened through the addition of salt such that the solution number density of mobile ions becomes comparable to that of the surface bound DNA charge. While this electrostatic screening benefits hybridization it also suppresses electrostatic interactions between the probe layer and the underlying support that could be used to control or to monitor the surface hybridization state. As an alternative approach that avoids this drawback electrostatic hindrance to surface hybridization can be tempered through the use of neutral i.e. uncharged probes such as peptide nucleic acids PNAs and Morpholinos. Moreover because the probe layer starts from an uncharged state binding of charged nucleic acid targets is expected to elicit stronger structural changes thus enhancing prospects for analysis of the hybridization reaction through purely electrostatic means.

From the selection of neutral probes the high binding affinity of PNAs provides strong mismatch discriminationthat is expected to be well suited to genotyping and to resequencing. Applications of PNAs have typically relied on 16 mer or shorter sequencessince longer strands or ones containing long stretches of pyrimidines and purines become increasingly challenging to prepareand have greater potential for cross reactivity with mismatched sequences. PNAs are thus expected to be less well suited to applications such as gene expression and pathogen detection which benefit from longer probe lengths up to 70 nt to provide robust identification of a target s unique origin i.e. a specific gene or biological entity . In such instances Morpholinos which place few constraints on sequence design or length are expected to be advantageous. Morpholinos also mitigate some of the difficult physicochemical properties of neutral DNA analogues for example they are about 100 fold more soluble than comparable PNAs and their relatively stiff backbone reduces propensity toward self aggregation.

One goal of the present invention is to present origins of electrostatic signatures of hybridization on charge neutral Morpholino layers and to contrast this behavior with that of DNA probe films. The preparation of thiolate anchored Morpholino films on gold supports is described first based on adaptation of mixed monolayer methods used for production of molecularly precise DNA films consisting of the probe plus an alkanethiol surface blocking agent. The efficacy of the blocking agent to passivate against surface adsorption of the probe backbone is critical and was confirmed with infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical methods were used to study hybridization between Morpholino probes and DNA targets. Changes in layer organization from probe target binding were related to the layer s capacitive charging response. The sensitivity and direction of the response including observation of contrast inversion were controllable by the surface potential V at which the response was sampled. At the molecular level these relationships can be explained from the combined influence of Vand surface charge stemming from hybridization of target strands on the local populations of mobile ions as further interpreted through Poisson Boltzmann modeling. Dual color redox labeling was used to simultaneously track surface populations of probe and target strands to derive a quantitative mapping between the capacitive response and the target occupancy. Viewed as a diagnostic tool for surface hybridization these label free capacitive measurements exhibit un optimized sensitivities comparable to established methods such as surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance techniques.

The general area of application of this invention is to enable identification of the base sequence of nucleic acid molecules in a sample targets or analytes by surface hybridization i.e. base specific binding to molecules probes immobilized on a solid support. For example this invention describes the capability to monitor the progress of the hybridization reaction using Morpholino type probes and label free in situ real time capacitive transduction. Illustrative areas of application are in monitoring of gene expression from biological cells and in identification quantification of pathogens or other biological entities based on presence of their genomic material.

Nucleic acid analysis by surface hybridization typically relies on DNA probes with fluorescent methods used to detect binding of target nucleic acids. In these methods targets need to be fluorescently labeled by one of numerous possible methods.Label free methods avoid the costs and experimental variability associated with the labeling protocols. The dominant label free detection platforms are based on surface plasmon resonanceand quartz crystal microbalancemethods. The present invention demonstrates that by using uncharged Morpholino probes hybridization of charged nucleic acid targets results in pronounced physicochemical changes at the surface which can be detected through changes in the surface capacitance. Capacitive detection has all the benefits of label free methods lower costs less experimental variability freedom from perturbation of the hybridization reaction due to presence of labels and in addition is characterized by 1 sensitivities comparable to or exceeding those of surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance methods 2 significantly more modest requirements in terms of instrumental hardware and 3 greater amenability to implementation in microelectronic e.g. CMOS biochip platforms.

In this invention Morpholinos a class of uncharged DNA analogues are introduced for surface hybridization diagnostics based on capacitive transduction. Monolayers of Morpholino probes on gold supports can be fabricated with methods similar to those employed with DNA and are shown to hybridize efficiently and sequence specifically with target strands. Hybridization induced changes in the interfacial charge organization can be analyzed with electrochemical methods to interpret and to quantify the extent of surface hybridization. Capacitive monitoring of the state of surface hybridization can yield both positive and negative contrasts i.e. increases as well as decreases in surface capacitance depending on surface populations of mobile ions as controlled by the read out potential. Conditions of read out potential for which capacitive detection produces optimal performance as defined by highest sensitivity to coverage of bound target molecules and by independence of the capacitive signal on the read out bias are identified. Quantitative comparison of surface capacitance with target coverage targets area reveals a near linear relationship and demonstrates sensitivities limits of quantification based on a 10 1 signal to noise criterion in the picogram per square millimeter range. Further improvements in sensitivity are expected at ionic strengths lower than the 0.2 mol per liter conditions explored thus far.

This invention is of general and broad interest to applications involving surface based nucleic acid assays defined as processes in which the sequence and or amounts of nucleic acids in a sample are identified by base specific binding on a solid support. Moreover the invention is of interest to companies providing products for nucleic acid assays.

Materials. Morpholino oligomers purified by precipitation were purchased from Gene Tools LLC. HPLC purified DNA probes and targets were purchased from MWG Biotech. Table 1 lists the Morpholino and DNA sequences their abbreviations and experimental purpose used as illustrative examples.

N 2 ferrocene ethyl maleimide F2 was synthesized as described.Synthesis of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid N hydroxy succinimide ester FC1 was similar to published methodsand is detailed herein.

All reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and were used without purification. Molecular sieves were placed into tetrahydrofuran THF and methanol solvents to keep them free of moisture. The synthesis of FC1 followed closely the procedure reported by Takenaka and coworkerswith modifications as per references 83 and 84. The following reagents were combined and stirred for 1 hr at 0 C. 0.26 g 1.1 mmol FW 230.05 97 purity of ferrocene carboxylic acid in 4.8 ml THF 0.14 g 1.2 mmol MW 115.10 of N hydroxysuccinimide NHS in 4.8 ml THF and 0.25 g 1.2 mmol MW 206.33 99 purity of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC in 2.4 ml THF. The mixture was then kept at 4 C. for 48 hr. The precipitate dicyclohexylurea was filtered off using a fritted funnel. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and the obtained solid product FC1 was washed with absolute methanol at 0 C. on a frilled funnel. After drying a 70 yield was obtained. The FC1 product was an orange yellow powder as described in reference 83. H NMR 300 MHz DMSO ppm 2.515 DMSO 2.876 s 4H COCH CHCO 3.337 s HO 4.425 s 5H Fc 4.737 t 2H Fc 4.964 t 2H Fc . shows the corresponding spectrum.

Electroactive tags F2 and FC1 were used to label target and probe molecules respectively to allow in situ determination of strand surface coverage. Amine terminated probes PM1 and PD1 were labeled with FC1 at the 5 end by combining 0.3 mmol Lprobe in 0.5 mol LpH 9.0 sodium carbonate buffer with a 150 fold excess of FC1 at room temperature for 16 hrs. Unreacted FC1 was removed on NAP 10 GE Healthcare and oligonucleotide purification cartridge Applied Biosystems prep columns followed by reverse phase HPLC Beckman Coulter Gold 125 Clarity 3 vm Oligo RP column from Phenomenee . HPLC conditions for ferrocene modified DNA probes were 50 C. 0.5 ml min and a linear gradient of 12 to 60 methanol in hexafluoroisopropanol triethylamine buffer HFIP TEA 100 mmol LHFIP 4.5 mmol LTEA pH 8.0 spread over 22 min. HPLC purification of Morpholino ferrocene conjugates proceeded identically but using a gradient of 12 to 100 methanol in HFIP TEA over 20 min followed by 5 min at 100 methanol. The dominant fraction of labeled material was collected and a second run performed to confirm purity. Conjugates were dried in a vacuum centrifuge Vacufuge Eppendorf and stored dry at 14 C. until use. For experiments requiring labeled targets additional TD1 and TD2 sequences Table 1 were purchased that also included a 3 disulfide CH SS CH 0H end modification. Labeling of target oligonucleotides started with deprotection of the disulfide endgroup with dithiothreitol DTT to liberate the sulfhydryl moiety in 10 mmol LDTT 10 mmol LTRIS 1 mmol LEDTA pH 8.0 for 2 hrs. Excess DTT was removed on a NAP 10 column followed by reacting the 25 mol Ltarget solution with 30 fold excess of F2 in 150 mmol LpH 8.0 potassium phosphate buffer overnight. Final purification collection drying and storage procedures were as for DNA probes.

The peak charges Qand Qwere determined by decomposing the experimentally measured current Iinto its three components S1 representing contributions from the baseline I and tag I I currents. The mathematical form of Iwas established empirically using monolayers of unlabeled probes i.e. in the absence of Iand I and was found to be well captured by a combination of linear and stretched exponential functions exp S2 where V is the applied potential and athrough aare adjustable parameters. The tag currents follow from theory exp 1 exp S3 where ais the tag s formal potential at the surface and aand aare parameters related to the peak area and width.

Probe and target coverages were calculated from the forward half of cyclic voltammograms. An initial guess for the baseline slope aand the intercept awas obtained from a cyclic voltammogram before hybridization with only the probe FC1 peak present using data between 0.1 V and 0.2 V where the probe tags do not contribute. The parameters aand awere then fixed and used in a fit of the first cyclic voltammogram that included both target and probe peaks covering data from 0.1 V and up to the positive potential limit typically 0.65 V . This fit yielded the additional baseline parameters a aand a which were then held fixed for all subsequent cyclic voltammograms that tracked the growth of the target peak. The remaining six parameters a aand a i FC1 F2 were fit for each successive trace to minimize the root mean squared error between Iand the calculated current I I I equation S1 . The reason for excluding the first 0.1 V from fitting is that the model is not designed to capture the initial charging transient that occurs at the onset of a CV measurement. The numerical routine was implemented in FORTRAN. An initial optimization was carried out using the Nelder Mead downhill simplex algorithm followed by quasi Newton optimization to more quickly converge to the error minimum.

Samples for electrochemical measurements were prepared on 1.6 mm diameter polycrystalline gold disk electrodes. The electrodes were first cleaned by mechanical polishing with 1 m diamond suspension rinsing with methanol and deionized 18.2 M cm water and finally by potentiodynamic cycling in 0.5 mol LHSOfor 60 cycles from 0.24 V to 1.54 V vs Ag AgCl 3 mol LNaCl reference at 0.1 V s. The electrodes were again rinsed with deionized water and without drying the roughness factor r r actual area geometric area was determined from double layer capacitance.Values of r ranged from 1.4 to 1.6. After a final rinse with deionized water the still wet electrodes were covered by probe deposition solution.

Probe solutions were pipetted directly onto cleaned supports. Probes were suspended at 0.25 mol Lprobe in deionized water Morpholino probes or in 1 mol LMgCl DNA probes . Following immobilization of the probes samples were rinsed with deionized water and then blocked in 1 mmol Lmercaptopropanol MCP Sigma Aldrich 95 purity in water for 90 min for DNA layers or for 150 min for Morpholino layers. The longer blocking times for Morpholinos improved reproducibility of baselines in cyclic voltammetry experiments. The samples were rinsed again and placed into target free hybridization buffer see below . All transfer steps were accomplished wet to minimize chances for adsorption of atmospheric contaminants.

Samples for infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy IRRAS were prepared on standard size float glass microscope slides coated with 5 nm of titanium and 100 nm of gold EMF Corp. Ithaca N.Y. . The slides were cleaned for 10 min in 120 C. piranha solution consisting of 7 3 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and 30 hydrogen peroxide solution in water CAUTION piranha solution is highly oxidizing and must not be stored in tightly capped containers on account of gas evolution . Following a rinse with deionized water the still wet slides were covered with probe deposition solution. Conditions were as for preparation of electrochemical samples except that in addition slides were prepared also without the final MCP blocking step. After drying with a nitrogen stream samples were used immediately for 1RRAS measurements.

IRRAS spectroscopy was performed on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with an 80 specular reflectance accessory PIKE Technologies . Spectra were collected from 900 cmto 4000 cmat 4 cmresolution with software correction for presence of water vapor bands. Cleaned but otherwise unmodified gold coated slides served as background.

Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI660C workstation CH Instruments with a three electrode cell comprised of the modified Au working electrode a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag AgCl 3 mol LNaCl reference electrode Bioanalytical Systems 0.209 V vs NHE at 25 C. . All potentials are reported relative to this reference. A glass sleeve salt bridge was used to guard against leakage of NaCl from the reference electrode s reservoir into the electrolyte. The electrolyte which also served as the hybridization buffer was 0.2 mol LpH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer. A fixed target concentration of 25 nmol Land probe coverages of about 5 10probes cmwere used. When data were not being collected the electrochemical cell was kept off.

Cyclic voltammetry CV measurements to determine the instantaneous coverage of ferrocene labeled strands used a scan rate of 20 V sfrom 0 V to 0.6 V or to 0.65 V requiring approximately 0.07 s per cycle. Probe and target surface coverages Sand S were calculated from the charge Q associated with oxidation of their ferrocene tags 1 where e 1.60 10C is the elementary charge Ais the geometric area occupied by the probe layer and r is the measured roughness factor. Qand Qare total charges from the oxidation FC1 FC1 e and F2 F2 e respectively corresponding to integration of the blue and green areas in after converting the potential axis to time. Each probe and target possesses one ferrocene tag. The T peak near 0.25 V represents increased current due to oxidation of F2 and confirms presence of surface bound target molecules. The probe FC1 signal labeled P is observed near 0.45 V. On the reverse scan the tags are reset back to the neutral ferrocene state. The figure also shows fits to the data from which Qand Qwere determined. Fits were calculated by an automated computer routine described above.

In AC impedance ACT measurements 1 a steady bias V is imposed to set up the surface environment e.g. distribution of mobile ions and 2 the charge flow current response of this environment to perturbations in potential is sampled using a weak sinusoidal read out function added to V. Under the experimental conditions used the response consisted only of charging currents with the electrochemical cell behaving as a series combination of a resistance R representing the electrolyte and a differential capacitance per area C representing the probe modified working electrode. Ccharacterizes the surface organization of the probe layer and for a series RC arrangement is calculated from the measured out of phase impedance Z using IZ I 1 2 fArC . f is the read out frequency. Z is related to experimental quantities using Z VI I I with Vthe magnitude of the imposed read out function and Iand Ithe magnitudes of the measured in phase and out of phase current components respectively. A useful interpretation of Cis as a metric of the near surface screening of electric fields more effective screening correlates with higher capacitance because greater charge dob must be placed on the electrode to achieve a potential increment dV see equation 2 below . Screening can be provided by polarization of the surface environment as governed by the local dielectric properties and or by redistribution of mobile ionic charge.

An ACI measurement consisted of stepping the surface bias Vfrom 0.25 V to 0.2 V in 0.025 V steps and back with Cdetermined at each step. A full C loop took 1 min and was performed once every 5 mm during the course of hybridization. A read out frequency f 5435 Hz and ac potential magnitude of 5 mV rms were used. This frequency corresponded to a phase angle of 45 to 50 and was sufficiently low to avoid secondary capacitive charging observed in the presence of the salt bridge at high frequencies yet high enough to minimize contributions from spurious interfacial charge transfer that become more prominent at low frequencies.

Theoretical predictions of the behavior of Cwere used to guide interpretation of observed experimental trends. Cis defined by the derivative of the surface charge per area of the electrode o with respect to the electrode potential V

Equations 4 and 5 were solved for V x by modeling the MCP probe film electrolyte structure as a multilayer inside of which each layer k of width t was specified by constant values of c and . Runge Kutta Verner fifth and sixth order methods were used to integrate equation 4 expressed as two ordinary differential equations dy dx k and dy dx y where y V x . The integration was performed from the probe layer electrolyte interface at x tto the electrode surface at x 0 with continuity of the potential V x and electric displacement dV dx at boundaries between layers. The two required initial conditions were 1 a specified value for V x and 2 the corresponding potential gradient dV dx at x x. The gradient can be calculated by integrating equation 4 analytically once if xand xare two positions within layer k then

For the semi infinite electrolyte with x x x C 0 and 0 and with dV dx and V going to 0 as x equation 6 simplifies to

The electrolyte was modeled as containing sodium cations and three types of phosphate anions with relative concentrations governed by acid base equilibria HPO HPO and PO. For the experimental 0.2 mol LpH 7.0 phosphate buffer the concentrations used are 0.315 mol LNa 0.0846 Lmol HPO 0.115 mol LHPO and 5.54 10mol LPO. The electrolyte dielectric constant was taken to be 80 and the temperature was 295 K.

Direct contact of probes with the solid support can be detrimental to hybridization activity for example single stranded DNA probes are known to adsorb to gold through base surface interactionsthat result in surface bound conformations with poor hybridization activity.Hybridization activity can be restored by treatment or passivation of the surface with alkanethiols such as mercaptohexanol or mercaptopropanol MCP with a hydrophilic surface chemistry to which the probes do not strongly adsorb. These displacer molecules assemble into a monolayer coating that lifts the probe backbone off the support leaving the strands attached through their thiolate bond only in an end tethered geometry favorable to hybridization.

Morpholino probes through their bases were similarly expected to exhibit an affinity for gold motivating examination of whether MCP is able to successfully displace these interactions. The thymine rich probe PM2 was selected for these experiments because thymine gold interactions yield an IR marker band in the region 1580 to 1600 cm attributed to C 0 stretches of chemisorbed thymine.A successful passivation of the surface with MCP in which the probe backbone is displaced from direct contact with the support should be accompanied by a disappearance of this marker band.

A specific state of surface hybridization defines a unique combination of immobilized and mobile ion concentrations at the surface. Conversely the response of this environment to an applied potential can be used to characterize the state of hybridization and in principle provides for a convenient label free approach to diagnostics. However significant challenges arise in quantitatively relating a label free electrochemical response e.g. surface capacitance surface potential field effect transduction with molecular coverage of analyte. The underlying relationships between surface organization and the measured response are obscure and at times counter intuitive for example both decreasesand increasesin surface capacitance due to hybridization have been reported illustrating that even the direction of change can be unpredictable. Similarly orders of magnitude disparities exist in estimated sensitivities of field effect transduction despite similar mechanisms of contrast.

In this section the aim is to fundamentally understand the physical changes induced in charge organization of Morpholino films undergoing hybridization and to compare these to when DNA probes are used. Optimization of Morpholino assays which perform best at low salt concentrations where DNA probes do not function will be reported separately. At the buffer strength 0.2 mol LpH 7.0 sodium phosphate used for the present experiments both probe types hybridize well. In the experiments that will be described the surface state was characterized at a point in time during the course of hybridization as a function of applied surface potential V through the change in surface capacitance C V brought on by probe target binding. In turn Ccan be interpreted in terms of the near surface ionic concentrations and dielectric strength. All of the experiments of this section used unlabeled targets in order to extend the positive limit on Vup to 0.25 V without interference from tag electroactivity in the determination of C at the cost of foregoing quantification of target coverage quantitative comparison of target coverage with Cis postponed to section 3 . The control experiments disclosed below showed that 1 target coverage was not significantly perturbed by changes in surface potential during Cmeasurements Impact of Changes in Potential on Target Coverage and 2 hybridization of Morpholino films was sequence specific with binding of non complementary TD2 targets below detection Nonspecific Binding of Targets to Probes CV Measurements .

Measurement of a C Vloop required 1 min to complete during which time the surface bias was perturbed away from the hybridization potential of 0 V. Since changes in surface bias may be expected to have an impact on the extent of hybridization there was concern that different parts of a C Vloop could correspond to significantly different coverages of target molecules. This issue was addressed by performing hybridization controls with F2 labeled targets using a sample with probe coverage of 7.0 10probes cmand under 0.2 M pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer. Control experiments consisted of performing a CV measurement immediately before and after each C Vloop to determine the pre and post execution target coverages. To minimize degradation of target F2 tags via the oxidized ferricinium form what would compromise accurate determination of coverage Vwas constrained to lie below the onset of F2 oxidation i.e. not to exceed 0.05 V note all potentials are referenced to Ag AgCl 3M NaCl . Thus in the control experiments potential was looped between 0.2 V and 0.05 V compared to between 0.2 V and 0.25 V for full Cscans that used unlabeled targets.

CV hybridization series testing for sequence nonspecific adsorption of TD2 targets to Morpholino PM1 probes were carried out at conditions of 4.0 10probes cmand 0.2 M pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer. To provide a stricter test of nonspecific adsorption a surface potential of 0.1 V instead of 0 V was used to facilitate adsorption of the negatively charged noncomplementary TD2 targets. CV scans were obtained every 5 minutes at 20 V s.

Strikingly as shown in the main panel of the response for Morpholino films to hybridization was tunable with a change in sign contrast inversion from positive to negative as Vincreased past 0.2 V. Moreover in the range from 0.2 V to 0.025 V the response was nearly independent of V making this range attractive for diagnostic applications. Above 0.025 V Cstarted to decrease with Vand became negative beyond the contrast inversion point at 0.2 V. In comparison hybridization of DNA targets to DNA probes produced C0 when measured at negative biases below 0.1 V. As Vincreased contrast improved and an increasingly negative C

The data in show that depending on Vand probe type binding of target molecules can manifest as an increase a decrease or a null response. Understanding the origins of this diversity of trends provides insight into the physical changes that accompany surface hybridization. In the data are replotted to show the full dependence of Con Vat selected time points for Morpholino and DNA probe layers. Between t 75 mm black points and t 0 min black trace the probe films were kept under buffer and non complementary TD2 target with little if any change taking place. Introduction of complementary TD1 target at t 0 produced horizontal and vertical displacements of the C V trace. As illustrated by the cartoons in the ubiquitous increase in Cat the extremes of Vis attributed to potential driven accumulation of solution ions near the surface phosphate anions at more positive potentials and sodium cations when Vis swept negatively. The elevation in surface concentration of mobile ions provides for more efficient ionic screening and hence higher capacitance.

The displacements of the C V traces in were interpreted with the help of the Poisson Boltzmann PB model described by equations 2 through 7. The MCP layer was modeled using a width t 0.67 nm a dielectric constant 4.4 and 1000 for all solution ions. These settings reproduced the experimental capacitance of about 5.6 F cmfor a pure MCP monolayer. Setting the partitioning penalty to 1000 effectively renders the MCP layer impermeable to ions. The description of the Morpholino layer proved more complex. One expectation is that unhybridized probes are in a collapsed desolvated state. The principal reason for this suspicion is that the surface concentration of 0.1 to 1 mol Lsignificantly exceeds the bulk solubility of 1 mmol L implying that the probes exist as a precipitated film. As a first approximation therefore the layer thickness twas set to the collapsed dry value of 0.52 nm derived from the measured probe coverage and a volume of 0.53 nmper nucleotide.

In order to capture the experimental upturn in Cat positive and negative biases it was necessary to allow sodium Naand monovalent phosphate HPOions to partition into the probe film under the influence of V. This condition was met by keeping the partitioning penalty small for these ions caption . However partitioning of divalent phosphate HPO led to an overly exaggerated upturn at positive V thus only monovalent phosphate was assumed to penetrate.Finally it is important to note that experiments express Vrelative to a reference electrode with an unknown absolute potential whereas calculations express Vrelative to solution. This leads to an offset in Vbetween calculated and experimental curves.

The above explanation and the PB model present a simplified description in that the charge of hybridized targets was assumed to be strictly immobile. This approximation is partly justified by the observation that at the high frequency 5435 Hz used for measurement surface tethered DNA oligonucleotide chains do not respond significantly to oscillating surface fields thus the main contribution to Cis expected to be from movement of small ions whose mobility is not impaired by backbone connectivity or the large mass to charge ratio of DNA.

The second type of adjustment illustrated in is a change in the dielectric constant profile. In general such a change could result from variation in composition thickness homogeneity or other structural rearrangement of the probe layer brought on by hybridization. The local dielectric constant represents capacity of the surface environment to screen electric fields through polarization higher values correspond to more effective screening allowing greater surface charge to build up in response to an increment in potential and increasing C equation 2 . A change in dielectric constant thus raises or lowers C causing a vertical displacement of the C V curve. This is illustrated in where an upward displacement was produced by increasing the dielectric constant of the probe film from 9.1 blue curve to 10.3 green trace .

For Morpholino films the impact of hybridization on the C V curve can be summarized as a rightward and an upward translation . The rightward displacement signifies a change in permselectivity that favors cations and expels anions as discussed above this outcome is expected from hybridization of negatively charged targets. The upward displacement indicates improved dielectric screening. These dielectric changes are expected to reflect various effects difficult if not impossible to disentangle. For example hybridization may improve solvent compatibility of the probe layer elevating the local dielectric constant through increased water content and concomitantly leave a thinner underlayer of unhybridized collapsed probes on the surface. It is the cumulative effect of such changes that would be reflected in the observed upward displacement in C.

Hybridization to DNA probes resulted in a rightward displacement of the C V curve indicating that in this case also binding of target molecules shifted the cation anion balance in favor of cations. The qualitative impact of hybridization on permselectivity was therefore same for Morpholino as for DNA probe layers. However in contrast to the Morpholino results the C V curve shifted slightly downward. Decrease in capacitance for hybridized DNA probe films was previously attributed to lowering of polarization screening because of volumetric displacement of solvent molecules by DNA targets whose dielectric constant is lower. This explanation also agrees with the present observations. Compared to Morpholino films target hybridization to a DNA probe layer should have little impact on the layer s solvent compatibility because of the good solubility of DNA probes.

The origins of the contrast inversion reported in for Morpholino hybridization are now clear. When Cis measured at a Vnegative of the Cminimum the unhybridized and uncharged layer is initiated in a cation rich state. In this scenario subsequent binding of target strands is accompanied by additional accumulation of cations rather than expulsion of anions of which there are very few in proximity of the surface. The extra cations are needed to ensure electroneutrality. In this cascade of events hybridization elevates the local concentration of small ions ionic screening is enhanced and thus Cincreases leading to positive contrast C 0 . However as shown by data positive of V 0.2 V in contrast can be also negative C

The experiments in helped elucidate physical mechanisms of surface hybridization on Morpholino monolayers but did not provide quantitative dependence of Con the extent of hybridization. This dependence was explored in a separate series of measurements using F2 labeled targets probe coverage of 5.8 10probes cm and six Vsettings 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 and 0.05 V. These potentials fall within the diagnostically optimal window in which contrast was strongest and largely potential independent . Cwas determined every 5 minutes at all six potentials and immediately following probe coverage Sand target coverage Swere measured using cyclic voltammetry CV . The combined Cand CV measurement required 30 s to complete. After subtraction of the fbaseline the six Cvalues from each time point were averaged and standard deviations were calculated. Target and probe coverages were expressed as the hybridization conversion x defined by x S S.

The label free limit of quantification I is defined as ten times swhere sis the standard deviation of the background prior to hybridization i.e. for 70

Morpholino monolayers on gold can be prepared through direct adaptation of known chemistries for DNA monolayers in which a thiolate bond serves to anchor Morpholino strands through one terminus to the surface and the rest of the surface is passivated against nonspecific adsorption with a short chain alkanethiol. Hybridization of Morpholino monolayers which are uncharged with charged nucleic acid targets alters the dielectric and ionic strength characteristics of the surface environment. Hybridization of target molecules adds negative charge to the probe layer which has to be compensated by changes in local concentrations of small ions i.e. by accumulation of cations and or by expulsion of anions. Which adjustment mechanism dominates is tunable by the applied surface potential e.g. at negative biases when surface concentration of anions is small accumulation of cations is the primary response mechanism. At positive potentials expulsion of anions is dominant. These signatures of hybridization can be monitored through the surface differential capacitance C where they lead to increases or decreases in Cdepending on the relative surface populations of cations and anions. Similar phenomena would be expected to arise in electrostatic monitoring of surface hybridization using other uncharged probe molecules such as PNAsor nylon nucleotides.The described physical processes are also analogous to those in other systems driven by charge effects e.g. in metal oxide semiconductor structures where semiconductor dopant sites take the place of immobile target charges and the phenomena of charge carrier inversion and accumulation correspond to accumulation of anions or cations in the probe layer.

A central motivation for the present study of Morpholino surface hybridization is prospects of label free DNA or RNA analysis. Based on a 10 1 signal to noise criterion Cmeasurements demonstrated limits of quantification down to 3 10targets cm corresponding to several pg of material per mm. This performance matches that of other label free methods including surface plasmon resonanceand quartz crystal microbalancetechniques that could be used for analysis of nucleic acids by surface hybridization. In the case of capacitive transduction sensitivity is expected to improve at lower ionic strengths under conditions more dilute than the 0.2 mol Lphosphate buffer used. These and related performance issues will be analyzed separately. If label free capacitive diagnostics are found promising they can be adopted to microelectronic biochip platforms in the spirit of recent efforts to develop fully integrated chip hardware for label based electrochemical nucleic acid assays.
