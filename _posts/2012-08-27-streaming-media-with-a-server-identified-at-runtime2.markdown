title: Streaming media with a server identified at runtime
abstract: A server machine may create a network connection to a device and receive a request to stream media that is managed by a different server machine. The server machine that created the network connection may be unaware of the location of the media at the time the network connection is created, and the location of the media may remain unknown to this server machine until the location is identified by the request, which may be received at runtime. In response to this request, the server machine that created the network connection may communicate with the different server machine and function as an intermediary in routing a stream of data between the device and the different server machine. In example embodiments where certain media is managed by the other server machine, the server machine may retrieve the media and stream it to the device using the created network connection.

The subject matter disclosed herein generally relates to the processing of data. Specifically the present disclosure addresses systems and methods of providing media with a server identified at runtime.

Streaming media may be provided by a server e.g. a media server machine to a client e.g. client device . For example various media streaming websites e.g. YouTube provide one or more media streaming services that allow a client to request and receive media e.g. all or part of a video file audio file a text file data file or any suitable combination thereof as a stream of data that can be presented e.g. played by the client e.g. within a browser application or a media player application . Streaming the media in a manner that allows it to be presented while still being streamed is distinguishable from providing the media as a data file e.g. an entire video file audio file or any suitable combination thereof that cannot be presented until the file is fully downloaded by the client.

Example methods and systems are directed to streaming media with e.g. to from using or any suitable combination thereof a server that is identified at runtime e.g. at play time at the start of streaming at the start of a download at the start of an upload or any suitable combination thereof . Examples merely typify possible variations. Unless explicitly stated otherwise components and functions are optional and may be combined or subdivided and operations may vary in sequence or be combined or subdivided. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident to one skilled in the art however that the present subject matter may be practiced without these specific details.

A server machine within a media streaming system may manage a database that stores various media content and in response to a request e.g. a connection request from a device the server machine may create a network connection e.g. initiate a communication session that is configured for media streaming between the server machine and the device. The server machine may then use the created network connection e.g. the initiated communication session to stream some or all of the media content to the device. Media streaming as used herein refers to communication of media in portions e.g. frames that are presentable e.g. playable in real time or near real time. The streaming may operate in upstream or downstream directions e.g. to the device or from the device . In response to a request e.g. a connection request from the device the server machine may create a network connection and allow the device to stream some media content to the server via the created network connection for storage in the database managed by the server.

In some situations after the network connection is created between the server machine and the device it may be helpful to use the existing e.g. pre existing network connection for streaming different media content that is stored elsewhere e.g. on a different server machine in a different database managed by a different server machine on the device or in a different database managed by the device . Accordingly the server machine that created the network connection may be configured e.g. by one or more modules that include software hardware or both to receive a request to stream media content that is stored elsewhere. Such a request may be denoted as a stream request and this stream request may be received from the device for example. Moreover the stream request may identify where the media content is stored. Accordingly where the requested media content is stored may be unknown e.g. unidentified to the server machine that created the network connection until the stream request is received. The server machine that created the network connection may be unaware of the location of the media content at the time the network connection is created and the location of the media content may remain unknown to this server machine until the location is identified by the stream request which is received at runtime e.g. at play time of the media at the start of the streaming of the media at the start of a download of all or part of the media or at the start of an upload of all or part of the media .

In response to the stream request the server machine that created the network connection may communicate with e.g. access a further server machine which may manage different media content stored in a different database. The server machine that created the network connection may be a first server machine and the further server machine that manages the different media content may be a second server machine. In example embodiments where the different media content is managed e.g. stored by the second server machine the first server machine may access the second server machine retrieve at least a portion of the different media content from the second server machine and stream at least the portion of the different media content to the device e.g. via the created network connection . In example embodiments where the different media content is managed by the device the first server machine may access the device initiate a data stream with at least a portion of the different media content from the device to the first server machine e.g. via the created network connection and provide the data stream to the second server machine e.g. for storage .

Accordingly the first server machine may create the network connection for media streaming and the second server machine may provide or receive the media content via the network connection created by the first server machine. This may have the effect of enabling the first server machine to stream various media content stored elsewhere e.g. at the second server machine . This may also have the effect of enabling the second server machine to provide media content to various devices without implementing a streaming engine capable of creating network connections suitable for media streaming. Furthermore this may have the effect of enabling a device to request and use a single network connection to the first server machine and then request and receive various media content from multiple sources e.g. the second server machine over the single network connection and these multiple sources may remain unidentified to the first server machine until media content from these sources is requested by the device e.g. at runtime .

A database e.g. a first database is communicatively coupled to the server machine and another database e.g. a second database is communicatively coupled to the server machine . In some example embodiments one or more of the databases and is connected directly to the network . The database may store various media content and the media content stored by the database may be managed e.g. maintained by the server machine . Likewise the database may store different media content e.g. media content distinct from that stored by the database and the different media content stored by the database may be managed by the server machine . Moreover one or more of the devices and may store or manage further media content e.g. media content distinct from that stored by the database or the database . For example the device may have a camera and the device may store a video captured by that camera.

As shown the server machine the database or both may form all or part of a media streaming system . Similarly the server machine the database or both may form all or part of another media streaming system though such example embodiments are not shown in .

One or both of the users and may be a human user e.g. a human being a machine user e.g. a computer configured by a software program to interact with the device or any suitable combination thereof e.g. a human assisted by a machine or a machine supervised by a human . The user is not part of the network environment but is associated with the device and may be a user of the device . For example the device may be a desktop computer a vehicle computer a tablet computer a navigational device a portable media device or a smart phone belonging to the user . Likewise the user is not part of the network environment but is associated with the device . As an example the device may be a desktop computer a vehicle computer a tablet computer a navigational device a portable media device or a smart phone belonging to the user .

Any of the machines databases or devices shown in may be implemented in a general purpose computer modified e.g. configured or programmed by software to be a special purpose computer to perform the functions described herein for that machine. For example a computer system able to implement any one or more of the methodologies described herein is discussed below with respect to . As used herein a database is a data storage resource and may store data structured as a text file a table a spreadsheet a relational database e.g. an object relational database a triple store a hierarchical data store or any suitable combination thereof. Moreover any two or more of the machines illustrated in may be combined into a single machine and the functions described herein for any single machine may be subdivided among multiple machines.

The network may be any network that enables communication between machines e.g. server machine and the device . Accordingly the network may be a wired network a wireless network e.g. a mobile or cellular network or any suitable combination thereof. The network may include one or more portions that constitute a private network a public network e.g. the Internet or any suitable combination thereof.

The server machine may further include a plug in that is configured to interface with the media server software e.g. via the API . For example the plug in may be an input output I O plug in e.g. a file I O plug in that modifies or updates the behavior e.g. default behavior of the media server software . As shown in the plug in includes a connection module and a stream module . Functionality of the connection module and the stream module according to various example embodiments is discussed below. Any one or more of the modules shown in may be configured to communicate with each other e.g. via a bus shared memory or a switch . Any one or more of the modules described herein may be implemented using hardware e.g. a processor of a machine or a combination of hardware and software.

According to various example embodiments one or more of the methodologies described herein may facilitate a data provision service e.g. a media streaming service in which a first server machine is configured to provide various information e.g. media or media content stored elsewhere to a device. Moreover one or more of the methodologies described herein may enable a second server machine to provide information to the device via a network connection created by the first server machine. Furthermore one or more of the methodologies described herein may enable the device to request and use a single network connection to the first server machine and then receive or transmit various data to or from the second server machine which may remain unidentified to the first server machine until the device requests such communication of the various data e.g. at runtime . Hence one or more the methodologies described herein may facilitate enhanced data services in which the server machine that creates a network connection with a device is not necessarily the server machine from which data is retrieved and provided to the device. Likewise one or more of the methodologies described herein may facilitate enhanced data services in which the server machine that creates a network connection with a device is not necessarily the server machine to which data is uploaded and stored from the device.

When these effects are considered in aggregate one or more of the methodologies described herein may obviate a need for certain efforts or resources that otherwise would be involved in provision of such enhanced data services. Efforts expended by a user in configuring network connections and initiating communications of data streams may be reduced by one or more of the methodologies described herein. Computing resources used by one or more machines databases or devices e.g. within the network environment may similarly be reduced. Examples of such computing resources include processor cycles network traffic memory usage data storage capacity power consumption and cooling capacity.

The machine includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU a digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a radio frequency integrated circuit RFIC or any suitable combination thereof a main memory and a static memory which are configured to communicate with each other via a bus . The machine may further include a graphics display e.g. a plasma display panel PDP a light emitting diode LED display a liquid crystal display LCD a projector or a cathode ray tube CRT . The machine may also include an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a touchpad a trackball a joystick a motion sensor or other pointing instrument a storage unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory within the processor e.g. within the processor s cache memory or both during execution thereof by the machine . Accordingly the main memory and the processor may be considered as machine readable media. The instructions may be transmitted or received over a network e.g. network via the network interface device .

As used herein the term memory refers to a machine readable medium able to store data temporarily or permanently and may be taken to include but not be limited to random access memory RAM read only memory ROM buffer memory flash memory and cache memory. While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database or associated caches and servers able to store instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium or combination of multiple media that is capable of storing instructions for execution by a machine e.g. machine such that the instructions when executed by one or more processors of the machine e.g. processor cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein. Accordingly a machine readable medium refers to a single storage apparatus or device as well as cloud based storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatus or devices. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to one or more data repositories in the form of a solid state memory an optical medium a magnetic medium or any suitable combination thereof.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an API .

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals. or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or any suitable combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information. Furthermore unless specifically stated otherwise the terms a or an are herein used as is common in patent documents to include one or more than one instance. Finally as used herein the conjunction or refers to a non exclusive or unless specifically stated otherwise.
