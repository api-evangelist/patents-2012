This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 114 831 entitled Method And Apparatus For Notification On An Electronic Handheld Device Using An Attention Manager filed May 5 2008 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 7 370 289 entitled Method And Apparatus For Notification On An Electronic Handheld Device Using An Attention Manager issued May 6 2008 each assigned to the assignee of the present application. The subject matter in the above identified commonly owned applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to the field of providing notification from applications requiring user attention. The present invention also relates to the field of managing a plurality of outstanding attention requests with an Attention Manager.

As the components required to build a computer system have reduced in size new categories of computer systems have emerged. One of the new categories of computer systems is the palmtop computer system. A palmtop computer system is a computer that is small enough to be held in the hand of a user and can therefore be palm sized. Most palmtop computer systems are used to implement various personal information management PIM applications such as an address book a daily organizer scheduling calendar and electronic notepads to name a few. Palmtop computers with PIM software have been known as Personal Digital Assistants hereinafter referred to as PDAs .

Previously support for various types of alarms used to get a user s attention were simple and effective for PDAs with less capability. In those cases the operating system for a PDA would require the application with a record entry requiring user attention to be responsible for the alarm and user experience. However the alarm system was most effective when operating only with one application with alarm capabilities. This was needed because different applications with alarm capabilities would be unaware of another application s set of alarms.

Typically this application would be a datebook or calendar application. The calendar application could be used to arrange daily meetings and events. The operating system through an alarm manager maintains a queue of times for alarms and associated applications to be sublaunched. Thereafter the application e.g. the calendar application is entirely responsible for the alarm user experience.

Multiple applications with independent alarm systems did not provide an adequate user experience. In a typical scenario alarms that are invoked may be snoozed or suspended for a predetermined period of time to allow a user to interact with applications on the PDA. This is accomplished by hitting a snooze button. The user would later return to and follow up with the snoozed alarm at a more convenient time. In the best case the snooze button is intended to snooze all outstanding alarms or snoozed alarms.

However since each application was responsible for user interaction with alarms snoozing an alarm in one application would only snooze all the outstanding alarms associated with that application. The user would have to tap the snooze button for each application s alarm dialog before being allowed to use the device.

Thus operating systems only allow one application to invoke an alarm dialog at a time. Accordingly this one to one relationship between an operating system and one application on with an alarm system would be inadequate with today s more sophisticated personal digital assistants that have many applications requiring a user s attention.

Another problem with previous alarm systems involve multiple alarms that have been set off but not cleared. A typical user scenario is one where a user has left the PDA unattended for a period of time such as when on vacation and returns to an unknown stack of set off alarms that must be tediously dismissed on an individual basis.

The scenario starts when the next alarm the first alarm while the user is on vacation goes off. The operating system through an alarm manager sends a pair of sublaunch codes to the registered or corresponding application associated with the record entry requiring attention. The first sublaunch is user interface free. The application typically checks to see if the alarm is really still valid e.g. the meeting has not been canceled . If the alarm is still valid then the operating system sends the second sublaunch.

The second sublaunch provides for a user interface. Here the application is allowed to put up a dialog informing the user of the alarm with some rudimentary user interface. For example a typical calendar application responds to the second sublaunch by putting up an alarm dialog.

The alarm dialog opens a window on the screen and creates a nested event loop to handle events for the dialog. This nested event loop ignores virtually all events that would cause the dialog to go away e.g. hard key characters that would cause an application to launch are ignored by this event loop. The result is the dialog is fixed on the screen and it can not be dismissed until one of the embedded buttons is tapped.

Also the currently active application remains active behind the alarm dialog. However a user cannot see or interact with the application because the alarm dialog takes up the full screen. Additionally the user cannot interact with the active application because the dialog s nested event loop is processing all events. Thus the active application is effectively suspended until the dialogs have been dismissed or snoozed.

When a second alarm goes off before the first has been dismissed the operating system still sends the first sublaunch but defers the second user interface sublaunch until after the sublaunch from the first alarm has been completed. For applications that put up dialogs this typically means that only one dialog at a time will appear on the screen.

The operating system does not return to the event loop between sublaunches so when the first application sublaunch finally returns the second application s first sublaunch will happen immediately with third and subsequent application first sublaunches happening if necessary in the same order the alarms went off.

Returning from vacation the user is only aware of the dialog present on the screen and is unaware that a stack of dialogs may exist. The net result for the user is that each alarm dialog in turn must be dismissed before the device can be used. Additionally the dialogs are presented with the oldest first. This means that all the older dialogs must be dismissed before the most current dialog can be examined.

Furthermore the previous alarm system did not allow users to directly navigate to a record entry requiring attention. Navigation to record entries was unnecessary in a typical calendar application because the calendar hard button could be pressed once the alarm stack has been dismissed. Pressing the calendar hard button would navigate the user to the calendar display with the current date and time on screen. Presumably the most current or most urgent alarms are associated with the current data.

However if an alarm is set a significant amount ahead of the event in the future e.g. a 5 day warning on an un timed birthday reminder it may be hard to locate the birthday event once the dialogs have been dismissed. A user would have to investigate all the calendar entries up to and including the birthday entry. Even then there is no guarantee that the user will recognize that birthday entry is associated with the alarm.

Furthermore adding a go to button would be challenging with this simple application owned dialog approach. The problem is that in order for a dialog to implement the function it would have to back out of all pending attention requests. That means essentially throwing away any other information that is waiting to be presented to the user.

Similarly since the dialogs are stacked into nested event loops if two applications compete for attention one wins out and starves the other until the user dismisses that dialog.

At this point the second application takes over. A go to subroutine would be severely impacted. Instead of navigating to the application and showing the corresponding data a subsequent dialog with some other attention request would appear.

Accordingly embodiments of the present invention disclose a method and system of managing a plurality of outstanding attention requests with an Attention Manager.

Further the Attention Manager manages competing application driver demands for a user s attention automatically. Also the Attention Manager provides for a centralized mechanism for a more efficient user interface when dealing with multiple attention requests.

Specifically in one embodiment of the present invention an Attention Manager manages application demand for a user s attention. The Attention Manager receives multiple attention requests from varying applications. With each new attention request received that indicates a record needs a user s attention the Attention Manager stores the request in memory and determines if there are other outstanding attention that have not been cleared.

Depending on the number of outstanding requests the Attention Manager sends a request for record information in list or detail format. After receiving the information if there are multiple outstanding attention requests that have not been cleared and are not suspended or snoozed the attention manger creates and displays a notification dialog in a list format. If there is only one outstanding attention request or if all the outstanding attention requests are snoozed except for the new or first attention request the Attention Manager creates and displays the notification dialog in detail format. In either case the notification dialog is presented over an active application.

In another embodiment of the present invention each of a plurality of outstanding attention requests that no longer need a user s attention have been deleted from memory or cleared by a user. In a list view the user need only to tap on a check box to delete the outstanding attention request. In a detail view the user need only tap on the Done button to delete the outstanding attention request. In either case the corresponding record entry still remains fully stored in memory. Only the attention request has been deleted.

Furthermore the Attention Manager allows all the outstanding attention requests to be cleared simultaneously. In a list view if all the list entries no longer need further user on without individually the request all the outstanding attention can be simultaneously cleared.

Also in another embodiment of the present invention from a notification dialog the Attention Manager helps navigate to a specific record entry for further review through the corresponding application. Upon receiving a request to display a selected record entry from a selected attention request the Attention Manager automatically switches from the underlying active application to automatically launch the application associated with the selected record entry. The Attention Manager relays the display request to the newly launched application.

From there the newly launched application automatically displays the said selected record entry. Further a user is provided with user interface with said selected record entry through the newly launched application to view in more detail the record entry.

Another embodiment of the present invention discloses an Attention Manager that allows snoozing of all outstanding attention requests for all the applications located within a personal digital assistant. A request to suspend a plurality of attention requests applies to all the requests globally. The suspension lasts for a predetermined period of time upon which the Attention Manager again displays the plurality of attention requests. In the meantime the user is free to use the PDA and interact with any application without interruption from all the suspended or snoozed attention requests.

Additionally in another embodiment of the present invention an indicator is displayed simultaneously with an active application without interrupting the active application.

The indicator informs the user that at least one of a plurality of outstanding attention requests have not been cleared. In one embodiment the indicator shows that outstanding requests that have been snoozed are pending. In another embodiment the indicator shows that subtle attention for un timed events exist and are pending.

Further in an embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager can override a snoozing operation to display a plurality of outstanding attention requests that have been snoozed. In one embodiment a user can tap on the indicator to access and display the notification dialog in list form.

These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after having read the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments which are illustrated in the various drawing figures.

Reference will now made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention an Attention Manager for providing notification that an application requires a user s attention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

Furthermore in the following detailed description of the present invention numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of procedures steps logic blocks processing and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits that can be performed on computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure computer executed step logic block process etc. is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated in a computer system. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions it is appreciated that throughout the present invention discussions utilizing terms such as accessing processing or computing or translating or calculating or determining or scrolling or displaying or recognizing or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present invention is compatible with any electronic device having applications with alarm or notification systems associated with specific record entries requiring a user s attention. One of the common types of electronic systems which can be used in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is referred to as a personal digital assistant or commonly called a PDA.

For example signal input output device could be implemented as a modem. Further signal input output communication device also coupled to bus can be a serial port for communicating with the cradle . Additionally device can also include an infrared communication port.

Although the description of the present invention will focus on an exemplary personal digital assistant hereinafter referred to as PDA or palmtop computer system the present can be practiced with other electronic systems or electronic devices e.g. personal computer systems cellular phones pagers portable web devices etc. .

A PDA device may be in one of three states when a user s attention is required in use nearby or unattended. The Attention Manager is able to address each of these situations in managing attention requests.

If the PDA is in use the user pays attention immediately. The user will read about what needs their attention and either dismiss it snooze it or go to the application.

If the device is nearby the user hears the noise feels the vibration or sees the blinking light and may look at the device to immediately address the attention request. However the user may also just put the device back down without addressing the attention request. In this case in one embodiment the Attention Manager will nag the user by replaying sound vibrating in etc. The nagging continues at application specified intervals until either it gets the user s attention or it has nagged enough times after which the nagging will cease.

If the device is unattended then the attention requests will begin to accumulate and stack up since attention requests will go unnoticed and nagging always fails. Such is the case when a user is on vacation.

When an application or event needs attention the desired user experience is for something immediately apparent to happen a dialog appears a sound plays an LED blinks the device vibrates etc. In one embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager provides an interface to these behaviors so that a consistent look and feel is maintained across all applications.

In addition to getting the user s attention via some kind of special effect the Attention Manager provides a mechanism the user to understand what application or event needs their attention. For example a dialog with some text which might include the first few characters of an urgent message or the description and time of a meeting may be presented to the user. In another embodiment of the present invention to make it easy for the user to get more details about what needs their attention the Attention Manager provides a simple user interface to navigate to the application and to the data within the application.

Further when more than one event or more than one application requires the user s attention in another embodiment the Attention Manager provides a quick summary to quickly see everything which currently requires attention to follow up on items which are urgent and acknowledge and dismiss items which are not.

In one embodiment the Attention Manager is located within a layer of the operating system on the PDA . The Attention Manager layer deals with user between applications and alarms associated with record entries in the alarms. By centralizing the management of getting a user s attention the Attention Manager reduces the amount of code to write resolves conflicts between different applications that are competing with each other for the user s attention and provides a platform such that hardware for special effects for getting a user s attention can be easily added.

Additionally in another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager includes support for hardware that can receive data without explicit user requests. This includes receiving data e.g. SMS messages or e mail when not attached to a desktop or laptop computer receiving data e.g. pages when the PDA is powered off or even receiving data e.g. Bluetooth broadcasts when the user is doing something else with the device.

Additionally the Attention Manager can support new hardware devices which have dedicated communication services radios and can receive messages at any time. These devices may come coupled with user hardware dedicated to getting the user s attention e.g. LEDs and buttons.

The Attention Manager is only designed for attempts to get attention that can be effectively suspended. It is not suitable for anything that requires an immediate response. For example the Attention Manager does not attempt to handle a put away dialog that is used during beaming or requests to connect to another user or for a user to answer a telephone call etc.

The Attention Manager is not intended to replace a ToDo application or act as a universal inbox. Attention requests in an Application Manager are just reminders. Dismissing the attention request does not delete the item or record entry requiring attention. For example clearing an attention request reminding a user of an appointment does not delete the record entry detailing the appointment in the calendar application.

There are two types of attention requests defining the urgency of the attention request insistent and subtle . The insistent version addresses more urgent requests for attention such as appointments. An insistent attention request typically opens with some sort of dialog whenever possible. Further and depending on user and or application preference the insistent attention request plays a sound flashes an LED vibrates etc.

On the other hand the subtle attention request provides a visual and optionally audible indication that something has happened but otherwise does not disrupt the user s work flow. Subtle alarms tell the user that something has happened but does not disrupt the user from using the PDA . These passive or subtle attention attempts would be used for telling the user they have new e mail or perhaps that a holiday or birthday is coming up.

When an application makes an insistent attempt to get the user s attention a dialog much like the attention request dialog or notification dialog in opens. illustrates an exemplary dialog in detail form found in a calendar application. Dialog contains only one attention request since there may be no other outstanding attention requests that have not been cleared or there may only be one attention request to be addressed.

The dialog in is drawn as a joint effort between the Attention Manager and the attention getting application in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The shell the window the title bar and the buttons are drawn by the Attention Manager.

The remaining area in the center is drawn by the application itself. The text in area shows the due date and time for which a project is due. The text may include the beginning text for the record entry associated with the attention request.

The Attention Manager supports only drawing of the record entry in one embodiment of the present invention. The Attention Manager does not allow applications to include active user interface elements within the area drawn by the application. For example in scroll bars custom buttons or other widgets that may appear within the area cannot be enabled.

Again the dialog in is drawn as a joint effort between the Attention Manager and the attention getting application in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The shell of the window the title bar and the buttons are drawn by the Attention Manager. In addition the widgets or boxes such as box to the left each of the attention request line items are drawn by the Attention Manager.

In dialog the Attention Manager manages the list of items including the clear widget in the left hand column. Items are listed in order of occurrence with the most recent attention request at the top.

In each of the line items the remaining area to the right of the widget is drawn by the application itself. This gives the application some flexibility over what to display. For example in line item the calendar application draws the calendar icon and the line of text reminding the user to Call Mom. The line items are drawn to a specific list format that is suitable for listing with a plurality of outstanding attention requests on a display screen of PDA .

In each of the dialogs and user interface is provided by the user interface buttons in dialog and buttons in dialog . The buttons are wider and taller to facilitate finger tapping in one embodiment. In the Attention Manager facilitates a user to dismiss the attention request without removing the stylus from the holder.

The OK button is pressed to clear the attention request. In dialog the widget or box to the left of each of the line items is checked or marked to clear an individual line item attention request. For example a user may have addressed the attention request or may have found that the attention request is obsolete. In either case the attention request is no longer needed. By pressing button or the widget such as widget the attention request as presented by dialog and the appropriate line item in dialog is deleted from memory. Clearing the attention request removes the attention item from the list or closes the dialog.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention when removing an individual line item in the user taps on the clear widget in the left hand column here represented by a checkbox. The Attention Manager draws a line through each of the text lines.

However although the attention request has been cleared the associated record entry has not been deleted. Dismissing the attention request does not delete the item or record entry requiring attention. For example clearing an attention request reminding a user of an appointment does not delete the record entry detailing the appointment in the calendar application.

The Snooze button allows a user to suspend display of the dialog so that a user may use the PDA . The snooze buttons and dismiss temporarily the Attention Manager dialog. In addition after a predetermined interval of time if any attempts to get attention are still pending the un snooze will cause the dialog or dialog to re open. Snooze does not remove attempts to get attention.

The Attention Manager supports an indicator icon or attention tab that is presented simultaneously with a current and active application on PDA . The indicator does not interrupt operation of the active application. illustrates a launcher application that is running on PDA . An indicator is displayed simultaneously with the application and indicates that there are outstanding attention requests that have not been cleared.

In one embodiment indicator a star distinguishes attention requests that have been snoozed or suspended. When the list is not empty but there are no new then the star indicator will blink on and off until the list has been emptied.

Tapping on indicator invokes the Attention Manager to display the attention list dialog. The dialog presents the outstanding attention requests in the Attention Manager.

Returning to the snooze feature when the snooze timer expires the Attention Manager displays to the user exactly what was seen when the snooze button was hit in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. So if a user snoozed from a detailed view of an insistent alarm the user should see the same alarm dialog. If they snoozed from the list view they see the list view.

The Attention Manager allows for new attention alarms to be presented to a user even when previous attention requests are snoozed in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. For example an insistent attention request appears in a detailed dialog. The user then taps the Snooze button putting it to sleep for 5 minutes. Before the 5 minutes is up a second insistent attention appears. In this case the Attention Manager will display the second attention request in a dialog in detail form rather than in a list view showing both the first and second attention requests.

If the user taps OK to dismiss the second attention request the snooze timer for the first request is not changed. A few minutes later when the first snooze interval expires the dialog for the first item in detail re appears.

In another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager has the capability to incorporate all the snoozed attention requests under a global snooze request. This possible since there just one Snooze timer in the Attention Manager and the snooze operation applies to the Attention Manager as a whole.

For example in the previous example the user taps Snooze on the second insistent attention. This resets the snooze timer to five minutes and incorporates both the first and second attention requests under the snooze command. Five minutes later both items will reappear in the list view.

From this list view the user can tap Snooze again to reset the snooze timer on both attention requests or the user can check off one or the other to clear or they can simply hit the DONE button which closes the window but leaves the items pending in the list.

In step the Attention Manager automatically stores the attention request in memory. All the uncleared or outstanding attention requests are also stored in memory until they are cleared or deleted by the user.

In step the Attention Manager determines if the new attention request is a subtle or insistent attention request. If the attention request is subtle then process continues to step where the Attention Manager displays a subtle indicator in the title bar of the active application. The subtle indicator is small enough and programmed not to interfere with the active application. Process then ends in step .

However if in step the attention request is an insistent attention request then process continues to step . In step the Attention Manager determines if there are any uncleared or outstanding insistent attention requests besides the present attention request.

If not then process continues to step where the Attention Manager automatically sends a command or request for detailed information about the record entry associated with the attention request.

The detailed information is received in step of process . The Attention Manager then creates a notification dialog using the information received in step . Since the notification dialog only pertains to said first attention request the amount of information available for the application to draw in the dialog is more than in a list format.

On the other hand if in step the Attention Manager determines that there are outstanding insistent attention requests process proceeds to step . In step the Attention Manager determines if any of the outstanding attention requests are not snoozed or suspended or in other words active or still requiring a user s attention. Each of the outstanding attention requests are associated with corresponding applications and record entries. If all the outstanding insistent attention requests are currently snoozed then process proceeds to step .

However if there are outstanding insistent attention requests that are not currently snoozed then the Attention Manager sends a request or command to all the applications associated with the attention requests at . A request is also sent to the application associated with the present attention request. The request is for information about each of the corresponding record entries associated with each of the attention requests. The information must be in a list format since there are multiple attention requests that will be grouped together for presentation in a list dialog.

Each of the associated applications retrieves the corresponding list information for the record entries associated with outstanding attention request that are not snoozed. The list information is sent to and received by the Attention Manager in step .

In step the Attention Manager arranges each of the received list information to compile a list dialog comprising each of the list entries for the outstanding attention requests. The list dialog is automatically displayed on top of any currently running application. An exemplary list dialog is presented in .

In still another embodiment of the present invention the user can use the Go To button in dialog to launch the application and use the richer user interface provided by the application to access the record entry associated with the attention request in in more detail.

Correspondingly in dialog a user can access a record entry associated with a line item by tapping on the icon or text of the line item. For example to access the record entry associated with line item in a user need only to tap anywhere on the icon or text of the line item .

The GoTo function in the Attention Manager temporarily dismisses the Attention Manager user interface and launches the appropriate application to display details about the selected record entry. It is important to note that the application itself provides the user interface for accessing details about a selected record entry. For an SMS message a detailed display of the message may be presented if there were only one message or the application may present a list of all pending SMS messages when there are more than one.

For a you ve got mail attention request the e mail application would probably present an inbox for all messages. For an alarm attached to a calendar application the calendar application could take you to a view of the day containing the record with the current record entry associated with the selected attention request scrolled into view.

In another embodiment of the present invention the GoTo function also removes the attention request from the Attention Manager. Aborted or failed GoTo attempts will not cause the item to disappear because the application will not have successfully gone to the record entry associated with the selected attention request.

The list view in dialog presents in summary form a list of the outstanding attention requests that have not been cleared. The attention requests may consist of several pages and can be accessed by the scroll buttons . In addition Dialog allows a user to summarily clear all the attention requests in dialog by tapping on the Clear All button . This facilitates getting rid of multiple stale items after being away from the PDA for a long period of time.

Process begins when an Attention Manager receives a request to display a selected record entry in step . This request could be a GoTo request. The selected record entry is associated with a selected attention request that is taken from the plurality of outstanding attention requests. The attention request is selected from a notification dialog. In one embodiment step could follow step of process .

Continuing with process after step the Attention Manager switches the active application that is running under the notification dialog to the application that is associated with the selected attention request in step and automatically launches that application.

In step the Attention Manager the received the initial GoTo request to the application associated with the selected attention request. That associated application then processes the GoTo request and displays the selected record entry. Further the associated application provides for user interface with the selected record entry.

In step of process the Attention Manager will display a subtle or insistent indicator if there remains any subtle or insistent outstanding attention requests.

For example a first attention request is sent and displayed in dialog form with other outstanding attention requests. The user taps Snooze thus setting the timer. Before the 5 minutes is up the user taps an attention tab such as tab in regards the list and then taps Done . After a few more minutes when the original 5 minute timer expires the list will re open. Note that viewing the list did not change the snooze timer.

In another example upon regarding the list in the previous example the user taps the Snooze button instead of Done . In this case the snooze timer is reset and five minutes after the tap the list re opens.

When a subtle attention request is made the PDA does whatever hardware cues are requested beeping buzzing or blinking but no dialog appears. Instead a small on screen indicator or attention tab in the title bar of the currently running application will appear. The attention tab can flash or animate to get the user s attention. Tapping on this indicator will bring up the Attention Manager user interface.

In another embodiment on with hardware dedicated to the Attention Manager e.g. a button combined with a flashing LED the on screen display can be supplemented. A user pressing the dedicated button will open the Attention Manager dialog.

The Attention Manager supports a nagging feature for insistent and subtle attention requests. If the user does not respond by explicitly snoozing the outstanding attention requests or correspondingly dismissing them the alarms continue to make noise at predefined intervals. The nagging continues for a predefined number of times at which point the nagging stops.

The Attention Manager will provide the same nag options to all applications via an application programming interface API . The user can set these values in each of the application s sections in one embodiment.

When there are multiple simultaneous attention items competing for nagging the Application Manager defaults to the nag settings for the most recent insistent item and if none then for the most recent subtle item.

When a new attention request is received the Attention Manager will perform some combination of special effects which can include playing sounds flashing a LED and buzzing a vibrator in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The exact combination of effects is dependent on user settings both globally e.g. alarm volume and in the application itself e.g. which alarm to play. 

In another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager sends a command to play an alarm to the application associated with an attention request requiring attention. In this case the associated application and not the Attention Manager decides what type of alarm is invoked and the frequency with which it is played. These alarms may consist of varying alarms some of which are listed as follows audible alarms visual alarms vibrators LEDs flashing said notification dialog between video and reverse video formats etc.

The Attention Manager makes every reasonable attempt to open the dialog before the special effects are performed in one embodiment. Presenting the dialog first allows a user to know immediately what attention request is making noise vibrating etc. However it is possible that the user interface with the dialog will be busy. For example when PDA is recalibrating its digitizer the Attention Manager cannot open the Attention Manager dialog immediately. The Attention Manager instead will we perform the special effects as soon as possible before opening the dialog.

Also the Attention Manager supports system wide user preferences to control the set of special effects what volume to play alarms at or off and whether or not to flash the LED if any or buzz the vibrator if any etc. Applications will be free to override these system wide settings in either a positive way always blink the LED even if the user said not to or a negative way never blink the LED even if the user desired it in general in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

When multiple attention items compete for special effects the most recent insistent attention request s special effect setting will be honored. If there is none then the most recent subtle attention request s special effect setting will be honored.

Some third party applications put up their own model alarm like dialogs. The Attention Manager always has priority over any third party alarm like dialog.

In one case the Attention Manager puts up an attention request dialog. Thereafter a third party application puts up an alarm like dialog over the top of the Attention Manager. The Attention Manager defers the user interface phase of the alarm manager sublaunch until after Attention Manager has been closed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

In another case the third party alarm like dialog first appears. Thereafter the Attention Manager shows up over the top to display an attention request dialog. In this case the third party dialog will exist underneath the Attention Manager and will appear once the user has closed or snoozed the Attention Manager dialog.

When the PDA is off and locked it must be unlocked before any applications that use Attention Manager will not draw any details until the device unlocked.

When the device needs to auto lock the Attention Manager temporarily closes to allow the PDA to launch the security application. The security application coordinates this function in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The security application will re open the Attention Manager dialog after the security app is launched and the enter password dialog is displayed. This effectively puts the password dialog under the Attention Manager dialog.

When the user attempts to Go To any attention item the attention window will close and the security window will appear from underneath. Once the user has entered their password the Go To resumes and the application will launch. However if the user does not enter the correct password or taps on one of the other hard buttons to try to launch that application the Go To is effectively aborted and the reminder will remain in the Attention Manager dialog.

In another embodiment of the present invention Attention Manager can determine if outstanding attention requests have become stale or obsolete by deletion of the record entry through the synchronization process.

In still another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager allows for updating and editing of outstanding attention requests. For example a notification of new e mail messages could be updated to reflect the number of new messages.

In another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager allows clients or users to find out how many attention items are currently pending if any.

In another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager tells an application that a user has dismissed the item in the Attention Manager. The application may choose to clean or delete the corresponding record entry at that point.

Also in another embodiment of the present invention the Attention Manager provides a way for applications to tell the Attention Manager to forget about something. Typically this will be done after the application has handled a GoTo and the user has read about the item. For example if there is a subtle attention pending that says you have three e mail messages waiting and the user goes to the e mail application to read the messages the application can notify the Attention Manager to stop displaying the subtle attention icon.

While the methods of embodiments illustrated in process show specific sequences and quantity of steps the present invention is suitable to alternative embodiments. For example not all the steps provided for in the method are required for the present invention. Furthermore additional steps can be added to the steps presented in the present embodiment. Likewise the sequences of steps can be modified depending upon the application.

The instructions the steps and the data input and output from the steps of process and may be implemented shown in . Furthermore other types of memory storage can be utilized to accomplish the aforementioned such as a hard drive a CD ROM flash memory or any compact integrated circuit memory storage device.

The preferred embodiment of the present invention a method and system for notification using an Attention Manager is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments but rather construed according to the below claims.
