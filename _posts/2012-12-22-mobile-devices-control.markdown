Computing communication and entertainment devices such as mobile phones portable computers tablet devices and the like increasingly offer more functions applications and features which can make it difficult and or inefficient for a user to discover navigate and utilize. For example not only can a mobile phone be used for text email and voice communications but may also be used for entertainment such as to listen to music surf the Internet watch video content gaming and for photo and video imaging. Similarly a portable tablet device may be utilized for email browser navigation and other computing applications as well as for the various entertainment and photo features. In addition to the many computing communication and entertainment applications that are available to a user of a mobile phone or tablet device a seemingly unlimited number of third party applications and features are also available for download to a device.

Many of the functions applications and features of the various computing communication and entertainment devices are beneficial to a user and can enhance one s personal time as well as work and social activities. For example children can let their parents know by text message or with a phone call from a mobile phone their whereabouts or that they have safely arrived at a particular destination. However an increasing problem with these always connected mobile devices is distracted driving. Many drivers and particularly teenage drivers are tempted to send a quick text make a call or check a voice message while driving which may lead to an accident. Accordingly the functionality made accessible by the mobile devices may be outweighed by the dangers of the devices in certain situations.

This Summary introduces simplified concepts of mobile devices control and the concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description and or shown in the Figures. This Summary should not be considered to describe essential features of the claimed subject matter nor used to determine or limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In embodiments a mobile device includes a communication interface for control communication with associated devices of the mobile device and the associated devices correspond to members of a private interaction hub. A device control service is implemented to determine that the mobile device is moving in a vehicle based on motion data and can generate a device quiet control to restrict at least audible outputs from one or more of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The device control service can then initiate communication of the device quiet control to the associated devices in the vehicle to quiet the associated devices that are controllable from the mobile device. In addition to restricting the audible outputs from the associated devices the device control service can generate the device quiet control to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device.

In embodiments the mobile device includes an integrated display device to display a device control user interface and a device quiet input can be received via the device control user interface to initiate the device quiet control for the associated devices. The device quiet input may be received as a user input to the mobile device or as an automated input such as when detected audio in the vehicle is determined to be a driver distraction. The mobile device may also include an audio sensor to detect audio in the vehicle and the device control service can then generate a safe driving notification such as for display on the integrated display device to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction. A distracted driving notification can also be generated and communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device where the safe driving notification is generated for display at the associated devices to indicate that use of an associated device is restricted in a safe driving mode.

In embodiments a device control system includes a network service e.g. a network of one or more server devices that executes computer instructions as a device control service. The device control service is implemented to receive a device distraction input from a mobile device that is moving in a vehicle and generate a device quiet control to restrict at least audible outputs from associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The device control service can determine associated devices that correspond to members of a private interaction hub and that are controllable by the mobile device based on identifiers of the mobile device and the associated devices. A device quiet control can then be communicated to the associated devices to quiet the devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device.

The device control service can also generate the device quiet control for a designated time duration and or to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. Additionally the device distraction input that is received from the mobile device may include an indication that audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction. The device control service can then generate a distracted driving notification to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction and the distracted driving notification is communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device such as for display to indicate that use of an associated device is restricted in a safe driving mode.

Device control service techniques are described. Distracted driving has become an ever increasing problem due to the prevalence of mobile devices. Many drivers and particularly teenage drivers for instance are tempted to send a quick text make a call or check a voice message while driving which may lead to an accident.

Techniques are described herein that may leverage use of a device control service to control access to content and other functionality of one client device by another client device. An example of this is a device quiet zone device quiet control safe driving notifications and so on that may encourage safe driving on the part of a user of the device. A variety of other examples are also contemplated as further described in relation to the following sections.

While features and concepts of mobile devices control can be implemented in any number of different devices systems networks environments and or configurations embodiments of mobile devices control are described in the context of the following example devices systems and methods.

The client devices are illustrated as including respective communication modules . The communication modules are representative of functionality of the devices to communicate via the network such as to communicate with each other. The communication modules may perform this communication using a variety of techniques such as to support voice communication text messaging e.g. SMS MMS instant messaging communication via a social network service email near field communication NFC and so on. Accordingly the client devices may utilize a variety of different techniques to communicate with each other.

The client device is also illustrated as supporting a hub coordination architecture . The hub coordination architecture is representative of functionality to provide a hub that supports communication between members of the hub to share data. The hub for instance may include a user interface via which users of the client device may share content based on membership to the hub. Accordingly the membership may act to support permissions on content between the users of the hub based on membership to the hub. A variety of different content may be shared via the hub such as messaging photos links background image of the hub videos and so on.

Designated member relationships can be utilized to define how the data and information is managed in relation to the hub and can be implemented to leverage the social contract embodied in the hub. In embodiments the hub is implemented by the hub coordination architecture as a user interface and or a client device application for integration and aggregation of the hub orientated communications activities and information. A hub can be implemented as a private shared space that is limited to access by defined members of the hub. The hub for instance may contain links to other members profiles and based on restriction settings allows aggregation for visibility of some of other members data and information within the hub and so on. The hub may also be configured to share a group calendar which can be viewed and edited a common text message window a posting board a shared photo album a check in feature and any other type of shared information as further described as follows and show in relation to .

An example of this functionality is illustrated in as a device control service . The device control service is representative of functionality of client device to control access to content and other functionality of one client device by another client device. An example of this is a device quiet zone device quiet control safe driving notifications and so on. A variety of other examples are also contemplated as further described in relation to the following sections.

The hub is a central space for membership orientated coordination of communications activities information and integration. Designated member relationships can be utilized to define how the data and information is managed and can be implemented to leverage the social contract such as between members of a defined familial group in the illustrated example. In one or more implementations the hub is implemented as a user interface e.g. via a client device application for integration and aggregation of the membership orientated communications activities and information. A hub can be implemented as a private shared space between defined members. The hub contains links to other members profiles and based on restriction settings allows aggregation for visibility of some of other members data and information within the hub. The hub may share a group calendar which can be viewed and edited a common text message window a posting board a shared photo album a check in feature and any other type of shared information.

Devices and or device accounts can be associated within a set of devices or device accounts e.g. a family phone account user accounts a connected set of devices and so on and all or a subset of the devices or accounts can communicate with other devices or accounts. The members of a hub can be defined by any number of different classes of people such as Junior Teen Mom Dad or Parent Grandparent Nanny Life Coach and so on for the illustrated example of a family. Further the members of a family can be defined to distinguish a live in Nanny from a Babysitter for example.

Additionally membership of the hub as well as use of the hub by the members can be controlled by a select collection of users such as one or two mobile phones by the associated users of the client devices. For example one of the members in the hub can be the designated control person such as a Mom who runs the household an employer and so on.

From a single configuration of the members the hub can be provisioned setup and propagated out e.g. automatically. The features and configuration of a hub may default to an automatic easy setup but any rule feature or configuration aspect can be readily modified by a user. Provisioning a hub may be based on billing e.g. a family billing plan. However if a phone device is changed to a different carrier for example the phone device can still receive texts related to the hub. Alternatively or in addition provisioning a hub can be based on email addresses phone numbers user account identifiers or any other identifier.

A retail person selling a new phone package for instance can easily identify the members each to their new phone devices and initiate the hub being instantiated. From a consumer perspective it just works and members can walk out of the store all set up. All of the data and information can be shared with a single selection and thus the members do not have to share each item e.g. a grocery list photos calendar etc. individually and separately.

The hub user interface may act as a shared space that is customizable and provides for user generated and shared content. Some information can be shared while other information is not. For example Mom s complete Christmas list is not viewable by the other family members but Dad and Kids can add to the list and only view their contribution . Hub setup may be performed a la carte meaning only the features that members want displayed on the hub wall can be selected. For example Mom wants to see the shopping list whereas Dad does not shop and so wants to avoid having the list displayed on his device yet he could still access the shopping list to add items when desired.

The hub user interface integrates functions calendar functionality event and or data summaries i.e. on the wall as well as content that is shared between the members of the hub e.g. lists documents etc. . For example the hub user interface may include a family check in or check in option. The hub user interface may also include a chat section where location check ins messaged are displayed along with other messages interchanged between the members of the hub. The hub wall is representative of an area via which members of the group may add to as desired like a lunchroom bulletin board family refrigerator and so on. In implementations the information can be aggregated in pillars or columns and shown on the hub wall as illustrated. The hub wall can also represent an interrelation between any of the information and data that appears on the wall and its placement in time. The hub settings provide that a user can control which functions are integrated and displayed within the hub such as on the wall.

The hub information may also be context relevant to the members of the hub and the calendar includes shared hub events. Calendar updates can be posted as notice events on the wall and a user can look at the wall to see upcoming hub events or the events that pertain to one or more other members of the hub. Messaging may also be performed that is private among the members of the hub. A member can instant text or other communication to all other members in the hub. Texting such as for a work meeting can divide each members display on their respective devices into individual screens for each member.

The hub may also be extensible and may link to a hard drive on a home computer or sync to just one of the other devices the manager or cloud control e.g. from a network based service . The hub may also be extensible to third parties that add a note on the hub wall such as implemented with application program interfaces APIs for functions to post data to the hub. A third party application however would not have access to the context of the hub wall such as to obtain or display hub data. In certain embodiments the private information and hub data could be encrypted and only decrypted by the phone devices that are associated with the hub.

Thus the hub supported by the hub coordination architecture may be thought of as a central space for coordination of communications activities information and integration of members of the hub. Hubs may be defined to support a variety of different membership such as for family members coworkers friends acquaintances fan clubs and so forth. Therefore although examples are discussed that relate to a family in the following discussion it should be readily apparent that membership in the hub may be defined in a variety of other ways without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Accordingly the hub coordination architecture may be used to support a variety of different functionality. An example of this functionality is illustrated as a device control service as further described below and shown in relation to the corresponding figure. Further aspects of hubs are also described further herein.

A parent dashboard is a privately shared space that has limited accessibility by one or more family members of a family group to view and control family orientated information and family members mobile device functions features and settings. The parent dashboard can display a visual summary of an individual family member s information such as phone usage history restrictions settings and the like. Furthermore the parent dashboard allows a family control member to set restrictions grant accesses and allocate information to the other family members in a family group.

In embodiments the parent dashboard is implemented as a user interface and or a client device application. Embodiments of a parent dashboard include any one or combination of implementation features such as described in the following paragraphs. Devices and or device accounts can be associated within a set of devices or device accounts e.g. a family phone account live accounts a connected set of devices etc. and all or a subset of the devices or accounts can communicate with other devices or accounts.

The parent dashboard can also be implemented to display the last changes and or setting adjustments to the dashboard itself so that for example if a kid changes the parent dashboard on a hub member s phone device the parent will be able to detect the changed settings. The parent dashboard may be implemented for viewing with an additional level of security on the authoritative parent s phone device such as by biometric detection or by entering a different access code used to restrict or lockout access to the parent dashboard.

The parent dashboard can include any type of settings and control selections that are user selectable or voice activated. A parent or other controlling entity can enforce the amount of television time gaming time and general device usage on all connected devices in the household that are utilized by hub members. The parent dashboard for instance can also be utilized to determine new contacts of a child or kid family member that has a mobile device and or to monitor texts for identifiable language.

A quiet time feature can be implemented by a control user to set usage and or function restrictions on other phone devices such as other family members devices in a family group. The usage and or function restrictions can be implemented for time specific periods and or based on the geo location of a family member s phone or other mobile device. The quiet zone features can be implemented as a user interface and or client device application or service. Embodiments of quiet time include any one or combination of implementation features such as described in the following paragraphs. Devices and or device accounts can be associated within a set of devices or device accounts e.g. a family phone account live accounts a connected set of devices etc. and all or a subset of the devices or accounts can communicate with other devices or accounts.

The quiet time settings for the hours and or days in effect on a per user basis can be enabled and or disabled via a user interface that includes time and day setting options common in scheduling features such as for reminders and meetings. The quiet time settings also allow a user to define what aspects of a device are disabled when quiet time is enabled such as when doing anything playing games communicating etc. A device that has quiet time enabled can display an indicator that quiet time is enabled such as an icon next to the current time and day or a display message that indicates quiet time is active e.g. displaying an icon or message Quiet Time on the device s home screen or lock screen .

Quiet time provides parental controls of friends family and kids that have mobile phones or other mobile computing devices on a person s phone bill account. The person responsible for paying the bill can receive notice when friends and family exceed text and data rates and a parent can disable a child s phone directly from the parent s phone. With remote parental controls a parent can initiate a phone curfew or timeout. Rules can be applied for mobile phone plans for data text and voice limits to automatically shut down the phone. There may be exceptions for emergency calls and messaging.

Quiet time may be time and or location dependent. A mobile device may also begin to learn and infer the regular schedule of a user such as when a kid is in class at school and then out of school. This may tie in with a family hub calendar to initiate various quiet time modes and settings. Quiet time implements restricted functionality rather than control of the quieted device. This may be implemented as a group quiet function such as during dinner and all family member devices are quieted. Quiet time may also be implemented as a one button shut down selection such as for church in a movie or to limit just gaming and so on. Quiet time may be implemented at a business or location such as at a church movie theater or coffee shop and patron s phone devices are quieted. Quiet time may be disabled so that a quieted device is reactivated by bumping for example by using NFC the quieted device with the parent control device from which the quiet time was activated.

Similar to the quiet time feature a quiet zone feature can be implemented by a control user to quiet other phone devices such as other hub members devices in a hub based on location time event and or the dynamic status of the membership of the hub. The quiet zone restrictions can be implemented for time specific periods and or based on the geo location of a member s phone or other mobile device. The quiet zone features can be implemented as a user interface and or client device application or service. Embodiments of quiet zone can include any of the implementation features describe with reference to the quiet time features. Additionally implementations of quiet zone may be initiated inside a car with hub members so as not distract the driver with noise music and other sounds from the other members devices.

Safe driving features reduce and or eliminate the distractions associated with a mobile device while driving. A mobile device such as a mobile phone can be synced with the automobile being driven and based on geo location and or acceleration rates the mobile phone can be disabled or partially disabled as well as implemented to interface with the automobile. The safe driving features can be implemented as a user interface and or client device application or service. In certain embodiments a safe driving implementation is not an application that can be uninstalled from a mobile device and may be implemented as part of the operating system of a device. Alternatively a safe driving application may downloaded to a mobile device as a third party application. Embodiments of safe driving include any one or combination of implementation features such as described in the following paragraphs.

A safe driving disabled mode is an example of a safe driving feature that can be implemented for a mobile device when a user is operating a vehicle with a wireless beacon device associated with the vehicle e.g. a Bluetooth hands free speaker microphone device . Mobile device safe driving provides that a restrictive disabled mode can temporarily disable a mobile device when the device is in the presence of both a vehicle wireless beacon device and another mobile device owned by an associated person such as a parent or a guardian. In this manner the solution does not present as a failure to the owner of the device. If the device owner is a teenager and Mom is driving the teenager has normal access to the device capabilities. If the device owner is a teenager and he or she is driving the safe driving mode can be disabled but the solution relies on the presence of Mom to reinforce and or remind the teenager of good driving habits. Safe driving mode implementations can dynamically change behaviors based on who is in the vehicle.

Devices and or device accounts can be associated within a set of devices or device accounts e.g. a family phone account live accounts a connected set of devices etc. and all or a subset of the devices or accounts can communicate with other devices or accounts. Mobile device safe driving can be implemented to restrict access to a phone based on GPS acceleration data as distinguished from the physical act of driving with car monitors. Safe driving is not tied to a particular vehicle and can be related to other contextual information that is not registered by car monitors such as loud music distracting friends in the car or other sources of distraction that range from passive to active behaviors. Safe driving information can be used to counter insurance claims of unsafe driving and rate increases and not just for teenagers but also senior citizens drivers with DUI s etc.

A safe driving mode user interface is implemented from which safe driving mode settings can be enabled and disabled and there may be many levels of disabling device capabilities. For example a safe driving mode can render the device completely disabled or just text messaging is disabled to eliminate texting while driving but not texting while a passenger in the vehicle. A device in safe driving mode can display an indication that a safe driving mode is enabled such as an icon next to the current time day and or the words Safe Driving Mode On on a device home screen or lock screen. Safe driving mode settings can associate one or more vehicles to any user and or number of devices. The safe driving mode settings can all be set remotely from an authoritative phone device such as a parent s mobile phone.

Embodiments of mobile device safe driving incorporate bi directional communication with a vehicle or can be implemented for no communication with the vehicle. Mobile device safe driving can also be implemented to limit vehicle speed so that a teenage driver cannot exceed a designated speed limit such as in a school zone. Safe driving can also communicate car service reminders to the driver such as to change the oil wiper blades etc. At the time of a crash the phone device can automatically report its status send messages alert emergency services etc. An emergency may be due to a crash and based on crash impact data or based on erratic inputs e.g. due to diabetic heart attack blown tire etc. and slow the car and send a text message. An emergency and or situation may also be based on a vehicle breakdown when the vehicle is pulled over to the side of the road at a detected location that would not typically be a stopping location.

Safe driving features and modes can be implemented for different levels of permissions for family members to loan a car to a friend for valet monitoring etc. The vehicle that is associated with a mobile phone and user can communicate independently of the device such as indirectly through a cloud based service to communicate safe driving mode notifications to a parent and or family members. A safe driving mode notification may alert a driver that he or she is going to be late for an appointment based on the current route of travel and destination. A message can then be generated to inform the driver to re route edit an errand list update GPS etc. For example a driver may be on a list of errands for Mom with mom s car. When mom cancels one of the errands from the shared calendar GPS informs the Kid driver to skip the next errand stop.

Safe driving features and mode implementations can also be utilized to manage a fleet of any type vehicles. As a driver approaches a vehicle the driver s phone is identified to the vehicle and can be paired with the vehicle such as via Bluetooth WiFi or other addressable device. This may be integrated with a key fob location proximate the ignition switch in a vehicle and or setup for different profiles based on the vehicle and phone to checkout a vehicle.

In a safe driving mode a kid s phone can become a communication channel that a parent can open with his or her phone such as to activate the kid s phone to record video and or audio at its current location. This may also be auto activated such as when the kid s phone is in another car that has been detected driving erratically or at excessive speed to send a safe driving mode notification to the parent s phone device. Safe driving features and modes are not limited to the control of a parent over a teenage driver. Any person that wants to drive safer can initiate the safe driving features and modes on his or her device. For example a rental car company can discount a driver if the driver implements safe driving mode while driving a rented car.

Safe driving features and modes can also provide warnings messages and notifications when driving in other countries or regions e.g. regional or country specific safe driving such as notifications of different road rules when driving in different countries. Safe driving features may also be implemented to recognize road and or weather conditions and provide warnings and notifications. Safe driving mode notifications can be filtered and optionally programmed. For events of a certain type an immediate text message may be generated. Alternatively or in addition a daily or weekly driving report can be generated and communicated.

Mobile device safe driving can utilize phone device sensors and features such as to determine if a user is traveling on a train as a passenger or determine bus pass information. A user passenger status may also be determined from audio and or camera images used to determine one s space in car train or other vehicle. Features may also be implemented to determine media access control MAC address ranges to identify proximate conveyances e.g. not just passing cars .

A safe driving application may be implemented in the vehicle for the bulk of the data processing and the phone device is then a client device to the vehicle. Save driving features can incorporate a theft deterrent in the vehicle application that identifies only those phone devices that when proximate or in the vehicle allow the vehicle to start and be driven. Near field communication NFC tags can be implemented in the doors of a vehicle to identify proximate phone devices of associated users in the seats of the vehicle.

The mobile device can be a controlling device that controls one or more associated devices such as mobile phones and devices for the members of a group that are family members of a family or business members of a business or are members of some other group to which the members are affiliated. The device control service can initiate device controls to control functions settings access and or restrictions of associated devices and can also control communication of group information to the associated devices for the members of the group. For example a user of the mobile device can initiate a device control such as via a device control user interface to control the mobile devices of other family members.

In embodiments the device control service can determine that the mobile device is moving in a vehicle based on motion data . The mobile device includes a positioning unit such as a GPS unit to determine position data and the motion data that indicates the device is moving such as in a vehicle. A vehicle may also be a designated quiet zone so that distractions from mobile devices in the vehicle are kept to a minimum. The device control service may be implemented to generate a device quiet control that is communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device to restrict audible outputs from the associated devices.

For example the user of the mobile device may be traveling in a vehicle with other family members that also have their mobile devices. To avoid distracting the driver with the various audible outputs from all of the devices in the vehicle a device quiet control can be generated by the device control service at the mobile device and communicated to the associated devices to restrict the audible outputs that are likely distracting to the driver of the vehicle. The audible outputs from the devices may include music and or video playback audio telephone call rings keyboard clicks and any of the many possible alerts tones reminders etc.

A device quiet control can generated and communicated to mute audio outputs of an associated device change sound settings of the associated device and or any other type of software audio control of an associated device. The device control service can also generate a device quiet control for a designated time duration and or to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The communication functions of the devices can include any one or combination of text messaging instant messaging and voice communication functions.

A device control user interface can be displayed on the integrated display device of the mobile device and the device control service can receive a device quiet input via the device control user interface to initiate a device quiet control for the associated devices. The device quiet input may be received as a user input to the mobile device via the device control user interface or as an automated input such as when detected audio in the vehicle is determined to be a driver distraction.

The mobile device can include an audio sensor to detect audio in the vehicle and the device control service can then generate a safe driving notification such as for display on the integrated display device to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction. A distracted driving notification can also be generated and communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device where the distracted driving notification is generated for display at the associated devices to indicate that use of a device is restricted in a safe driving mode. For example the user interface shown displayed on the integrated display device indicates that the mobile device has been quieted for safe driving.

In embodiments the central computing device may be a cloud of one or more server computers that are connected to the multiple devices through a network the Internet or other data communication link. In embodiments this interconnection architecture enables functionality across multiple devices to provide a networked service environment of the multiple devices. Each of the devices may have different physical configurations and capabilities and the central computing device can utilize a platform to maintain the associated devices identifiers and implement the hub coordination architecture and or a device control service . In embodiments the device control service at the platform can implement any of the embodiments and features of mobile devices control as described herein.

The cloud includes and or is representative of the platform for the networked service components e.g. the device control service that implements embodiments of mobile devices control. The platform abstracts underlying functionality of hardware such as server devices and or software resources of the cloud. The networked service components may include applications and or data that can be utilized while computer processing is executed on servers that are remote from the mobile devices and .

In embodiments the device control service at the platform is implemented to receive a device distraction input from a mobile device e.g. mobile device that is moving in a vehicle. The device control service can also receive motion data from a positioning unit of the mobile device where the motion data indicates that the mobile device is moving in the vehicle. The device distraction input may include an indication that audio from multiple mobile devices in the vehicle is a driver distraction. The device distraction input can be a user input to the mobile device to initiate a device quiet control for associated devices such as the other mobile devices in the vehicle. Alternatively or in addition the device distraction input may be automated from the mobile device based on a determination that the audio from the other mobile devices in the vehicle is a driver distraction.

The device control service at the platform can generate a device quiet control to restrict audible outputs from the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the associated devices are mobile phones and devices that correspond to family members of a private interaction hub such as family members traveling in a vehicle together. To avoid distracting the driver with the various audible outputs from all of the mobile devices in the vehicle a device quiet control can be generated by the device control service and communicated to the devices to restrict the audible outputs that are likely distracting to the driver of the vehicle. A device quiet control can generated and communicated to mute audio outputs of an associated device change sound settings of the associated device and or any other type of software audio control of an associated device. The device control service can also generate the device quiet control for a designated time duration and or to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device.

The device control service at the platform can determine the associated devices e.g. the mobile device that are controllable by the mobile device based on the associated devices identifiers and communicate the device quiet control to the associated devices such as to the mobile device and to any other controllable associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device . The device control service can also generate a distracted driving notification to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction and the distracted driving notification is communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The distracted driving notification is communicated for display at the associated devices to indicate that use of an associated device is restricted in a safe driving mode.

The following discussion describes mobile device parental control techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware firmware or software or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion reference will be made to .

Example techniques and are described with reference to respective in accordance with one or more embodiments of mobile devices control. Generally any of the services functions techniques procedures components and modules described herein can be implemented using software firmware hardware e.g. fixed logic circuitry manual processing or any combination thereof. A software implementation represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed by a computer processor. The example techniques may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions which can include software applications routines programs objects components data structures procedures modules functions and the like. The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable storage media devices both local and or remote to a computer processor. The techniques may also be practiced in a distributed computing environment by multiple computer devices. Further the features described herein are platform independent and can be implemented on a variety of computing platforms having a variety of processors.

At block a determination is made that a mobile device is moving in a vehicle based on motion data. For example the mobile device includes the device control service that determines the mobile device is moving in a vehicle based on motion data. The mobile device also includes the positioning unit that determines the position data and the motion data which indicates that the mobile device is moving.

At block the mobile device is recognized as being located in a designated quiet zone. For example a vehicle may be designated as a quiet zone so that distractions from mobile devices in the vehicle are kept to a minimum and the device control service implemented at the mobile device recognizes that the device is located in a designated quiet zone.

At block audio is detected in the vehicle and at block a safe driving notification is displayed to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction. For example the mobile device can include an audio sensor to detect audio in the vehicle and the device control service initiates displaying a safe driving notification on the integrated display device to indicate to a user of the device that the audio in the vehicle is likely a driver distraction. Similarly the client device can include an audio sensor to detect audio in a vehicle and implement a device control service to initiate displaying a safe driving notification.

At block a device control user interface is displayed. For example the mobile device includes the integrated display device on which a device control user interface can be displayed and a user can control associated devices from the mobile device with device controls that are initiated and communicated to the associated devices. Similarly the various client devices each include an integrated display device to display a device control user interface.

At block a device quiet input is received via the device control user interface for associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the device control service at the mobile device receives a device quiet input such as via a device control user interface to initiate a device quiet control for associated devices. The device quiet input may be received as a user input to the mobile device via the device control user interface or as an automated input such as when detected audio in the vehicle is determined to be a driver distraction. The associated devices can be other mobile phones and devices that correspond to family members of a private interaction hub such as family members traveling in a vehicle together. Similarly a device control service implemented at the client device receives a device quiet input from one of the associated devices that correspond to the members of a private interaction hub.

At block a device quiet control is generated to restrict audible outputs from the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the device control service at the mobile device generates the device quiet control to restrict the audible outputs from the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The audible outputs from devices may include music and or video playback audio telephone call rings keyboard clicks and any of the many possible alerts tones reminders etc. that may be distracting to a driver of a vehicle. A device quiet control can be generated and communicated to mute audio outputs of an associated device change sound settings of the associated device and or any other type of software audio control of an associated device. The device quiet control can also be generated for a designated time duration and or to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device such as any one or combination of text messaging instant messaging and voice communication functions. Similarly a device control service implemented at the client device generates a device quiet control to restrict the audible outputs from the associated devices .

At block the device quiet control is communicated to the associated devices to quiet the associated devices that are controllable from the mobile device. For example the mobile device communicates the device quiet control to the associated devices to quiet the associated devices that are controllable from the mobile device and in the vehicle with the mobile device. Similarly the client device communicates device quiet controls to the associated devices . The mobile and or client devices include a communication interface for control communication with the associated devices.

At block a distracted driving notification is communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the device control service at the mobile device generates a distracted driving notification that is communicated to the associated devices for display to indicate that use of an associated device is restricted in a safe driving mode.

At block a device distraction input is received from a mobile device that is moving in a vehicle. For example the device control service implemented as part of the platform receives a device distraction input from the mobile device e.g. a controlling device when the mobile device is moving in a vehicle. Motion data can be received from a positioning unit of the mobile device to indicate that the device is moving in the vehicle. The device distraction input can include an indication that audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction such as detected by an audio sensor integrated with the mobile device and or in the vehicle. The device distraction input may be a user input to the mobile device to initiate a device quiet control for associated devices e.g. the mobile device . Alternatively or in addition the device distraction input may be automated from the mobile device based on a determination that the audio from the other mobile devices in the vehicle is a driver distraction.

At block associated devices that are controllable by the mobile device are determined based on identifiers of the mobile device and the associated devices. For example the device control service at the platform determines the associated devices such as the mobile device based on the associated devices identifiers . For example the associated devices are mobile phones and devices that correspond to family members of a private interaction hub.

At block a device quiet control is generated to restrict audible outputs from the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the device control service at the platform generates a device quiet control to restrict the audible outputs from the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. The device control service can also generate the device quiet control for a designated time duration and or to restrict communication functions of the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device.

At block the device quiet control is communicated to the associated devices to quiet the associated devices. For example the device control service initiates communication of the device quiet control from the platform to the associated devices e.g. the mobile device and other associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device to quiet the associated devices.

At block a distracted driving notification is generated to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction and at block the distracted driving notification is communicated to the associated devices that are in the vehicle with the mobile device. For example the device control service at the platform generates a distracted driving notification that is then communicated to the associated devices e.g. the mobile device in the vehicle with the mobile device for display to indicate that the audio in the vehicle is a driver distraction and that use of an associated device is restricted in a safe driving mode.

The mobile device includes an integrated display device on which user interfaces can be displayed such as a hub user interface of a hub application . The hub user interface offers a unified interactive view of the hub data for a single private interaction hub and the hub application aggregates disparate types of the hub data originating from the various member users of the private interaction hub. For example the hub user interface may provide a single unified access point to shared hub messages status updates check ins hub calendar events hub media hub applications and other types of hub content. As described above a private interaction hub or simply hub is a private network or association of member users who voluntarily elect to privately interact and collaborate with each other in a bi directional manner. The hub data includes any shared data or metadata that is used to facilitate the interaction and collaboration between the members of a private interaction hub and may include shared data for messaging notes contact management documents tasks location updates photos calendar events applications to include collaborative gaming applications and or other media content such as any type of audio music video and or image data that may be available or accessed from any source.

The basic functionality of an example private interaction hub is shown as a golf hub displayed in the hub user interface of the hub application . For example the hub user interface can include various selectable user interface tiles such as a members tile that is selectable to initiate a display of the constituent members of the private interaction hub. The user interface tiles may also include hub chat and or messages tiles to allow a hub member to participate in shared messaging threads with the other member users of the hub. For example as shown the member Bob has asked Anyone up for a round right now The user interface tiles may also include a photo album tile that is selectable to view photos shared by any of the hub members with the hub and a shared notebook tile from which the hub members can view shared notes. For example the golf hub may include a shared notes document that compiles the hub members collective research of new golf equipment. The hub user interface may also display a shared calendar that allows a member of the hub to view edit and post calendar events that will be shared with all of the other hub members. For example the calendar tile shows an upcoming tee time at St. Andrews on Saturday at 9 00 a.m. for all of the members. When a user selects a group item e.g. the message from Bob or tile e.g. the messaging tile further details about the selected item or group items related to the selected tile may be displayed by the hub application itself or the hub application may call a different device application e.g. a messaging application to display further details about the item s .

When a user selects or otherwise engages with a piece of displayed hub data such as the golf message from Bob the hub application may provide additional details or options to the user to permit the user to interact further with the hub data. For example the hub application may display controls to allow the user to edit or reply to Bob s message. Alternatively or in addition when a user selects or otherwise engages with a piece of displayed hub data e.g. Bob s message the hub application may launch or call another device application to permit the user to further interact with the piece of hub data e.g. the hub application may call a native messaging application .

The hub user interface of the hub application can also include user selectable access to third party applications such as when an application is pinned to or otherwise shared with a private interaction hub. A pinned third party application may also utilize the shared hub data such as shared application preferences or shared application state data. For example the golf hub shown displayed in the hub user interface includes a live tile representing a third party weather application that the members of the hub can quickly access to check the weather forecast at their local golf club such as when planning an upcoming golf outing. A user of the mobile device can also customize display aspects of a hub user interface such as the content of the user interface and how the elements of the hub user interface are arranged. Another example of a hub user interface of the hub application is a panoramic hub user interface such as for a family centric private interaction hub as shown and described in greater detail with reference to .

The example system also includes a hub management service and a cloud storage and service . The hub management service manages the formation and maintenance of private interaction hubs . The hub management service can correlate or associate member users of a hub by associating account identifiers of the members with one or more of the private interaction hubs. The account identifier of a member user may be associated with an identifier of a private interaction hub in a data table that the hub management service maintains to correlate the hub members with one or more of the private interaction hubs. The hub management service may also associate devices that correspond to hub members based on device identifiers. The account identifiers can include user membership identifiers and or sign on credentials such as an email and password combination or a username and password combination. The sign on credentials may be single sign on SSO credentials that are utilized for authentication purposes at a number of Web services including the cloud storage and service .

The cloud storage and service can include any type of cloud based e.g. network based data and messaging services . The messaging services may include any type of email text e.g. SMS MMS and or instant messaging services. The data services may include any type of calendar photo album file or document sharing location mapping music sharing video sharing gaming contacts management and or notebook services as well as any other type of services that can be used to share stored hub data . The stored hub data can include any form of messages updates events content media and information that is maintained for the private interaction hubs and is accessible from the mobile device either upon a request from a device and or upon a data push to the device. The cloud storage and service also maintains stored hub metadata that includes settings and information pertaining to the private interaction hubs such as the name of a hub the background image or photo of the hub and an association of the hub members.

Although shown together as data and messaging services various application data services and various messaging services may be operated on separate devices and or operated by separate distinct entities. Additionally although the hub management service and the cloud storage and service are shown as independent services they may be implemented together as a single service. Further a server device or group of server devices can include implementations of both the hub management service and the cloud storage and service representative of a single entity that may be the same server system company system domain and the like.

The cloud storage and service and its constituent data and messaging services interchange the stored hub data and the stored hub metadata between the mobile devices that are associated with member users of a private interaction hub . For example a data and or messaging service of the cloud storage and service can receive a copy of hub data and or hub metadata from the mobile device that is used by a hub member store this hub data and hub metadata in the cloud storage as the respective stored hub data and stored hub metadata and then distribute the stored hub data and stored hub metadata to other mobile devices associated with other member users of the same private interaction hub as well as to other mobile devices associated with the same hub member. The stored hub metadata can include membership information pertaining to the member users of a private interaction hub hub identifiers that correlate a piece of hub data to a particular private interaction hub user identifiers that correlate a piece of hub data to a particular member user modification dates and or other metadata.

The cloud storage and service and its constituent data and messaging services may utilize single sign on SSO credentials for authentication purposes to limit the dissemination of the stored hub data and the stored hub metadata to only the authorized devices of hub members. Additionally any of the devices and services e.g. implemented as server devices described herein can communicate via a network which can be implemented to include a wired and or a wireless network. The network can also be implemented using any type of network topology and or communication protocol and can be represented or otherwise implemented as a combination of two or more networks to include IP based networks and or the Internet. The network may also include mobile operator networks that are managed by a mobile network operator and or other network operators such as a communication service provider mobile phone provider and or Internet service provider. Alternatively or in addition peer to peer communication techniques may be utilized such as multiple devices connected using a peer to peer communication network.

The mobile device includes an operating system of the device and the operating system includes a hub operating system service that is implemented to integrate cloud based services a hub application and local device applications with the operating system to implement aspects of the private interaction hubs . The aspects that may be implemented include hub formation and membership maintenance synchronizing the hub data on the mobile device with the stored hub data and the hub metadata with the stored hub metadata with the cloud storage and service and providing the hub application and the local device applications on the mobile device with access to the hub data and the hub metadata . For example the hub operating system service may directly access the stored hub metadata at the cloud storage and service .

The hub operating system service or alternatively the hub application may also determine and maintain a local copy of the membership associations of member users account identifiers and identifiers of the private interaction hubs. The hub operating system service may also synchronize the stored hub data from the cloud storage and service with the hub data at the mobile device and synchronize the stored hub metadata from the cloud storage and service with the hub metadata at the mobile device. The hub operating system service may also synchronize with the cloud storage and service e.g. by sending changes or additions to hub data and hub metadata to the cloud storage and service . Such data synchronizations may occur in response to a user launching the hub application.

The mobile device includes the device applications that permit a user of the mobile device to access create and or modify the hub data private data of the user as well as the stored hub data that is managed by any of the data and messaging services at the cloud storage and service . Some or all of the device applications may be implemented as client side components or modules of any of the data and messaging services or may be implemented as standalone native applications e.g. local device applications at the mobile device. The device applications typically each consume and provide access to only a portion or subset of the hub data and the private data such as only a single type of hub data and private data e.g. only messaging data but not calendar data . The device applications also typically present the consumed hub data to a user in conjunction with the private data . Private data is data or metadata that is not associated with a private interaction hub and that has not been shared with other members of the hub e.g. data that has not been shared via the cloud storage and service .

The device applications at the mobile device may include a native or third party messaging application that provides a user with messaging alerts and access to messaging threads. The messaging application provides access to both shared message threads shared with a private interaction hub and private message threads between a user of the mobile device and others who are not members of the hub. The messaging application also allows a user to send a message to all of the hub members without accessing a hub user interface of the hub application. The messaging application may not provide user access to other types of the hub data other than the hub messages. For example the messaging application may not provide access to the shared calendar events or shared photo albums of the hub.

The device applications may also include a native or third party calendaring application that provides scheduling alerts and access to a visual calendar. The calendaring application provides user access to both shared calendar events that are shared with hub members and private calendar events e.g. Exchange calendar events that have not been shared with other members of the hub. The calendaring application also allows a user to create and or share a calendar event to all members of the hub without accessing a hub user interface of the hub application. The application may not provide user access to other types of the hub data other than the hub calendar events. For example the calendaring application may not provide access to the shared message threads or shared photo albums of the hub.

The device applications may also include a native or third party media viewing and or editing application that provides access to photo albums of digital photos or other digital media. The media application provides user access to both shared media files e.g. photos videos and or music shared with a private interaction hub and private media files that have not been shared with other members of the hub. The media application also allows a user to share media files with all members of the hub without accessing a hub user interface of the hub application. The media application may not provide user access to other types of hub data other than hub media files. For example the media application may not provide access to the shared message threads or shared calendar events of the hub.

The hub operating system service can expose one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs application binary interfaces and or other types of interfaces to the hub application and to the device applications on the mobile device to allow these applications to access generate and or modify the hub data and or the hub metadata as described herein. The hub operating system service can be implemented as an integrated software component or module of the operating system . The hub operating system service can be maintained at the mobile device as executable instructions that are stored on computer readable storage media such as any suitable memory device or electronic data storage as described with reference to the example device shown in . Additionally the hub operating system service can be executed with a processing system at the mobile device to implement aspects of private interaction hubs.

In embodiments the hub operating system service can initiate the hub management service to provision a private interaction hub . A user of the mobile device can start a private interaction hub and also invite others to join an existing private interaction hub. For example the hub user interface of the hub application may provide an existing hub member with the option to add a new member to the hub and the user may identify the prospective member by providing either a mobile device number or by selecting an existing contact from one of their social networks or other contacts.

The hub operating system service can receive the request from an existing member user of the device and in response the hub operating system service and or the hub management service communicates an invitation to join the hub as an SMS MMS or instant message sent to the prospective member s mobile device that may include a link to a registration site or other registration instructions. The hub operating system service and or the hub management service receives e.g. via a registration website an acceptance to the invitation to join the private interaction hub that includes at least an account identifier such as an SSO credential and associates the new member with the existing hub at the hub management service . Updated membership information including the new member s account identifier may also be propagated to other mobile devices of other members in the private interaction hub from the hub management service . When the new member user joins the hub he or she may be prompted to download and or install various applications configured to provide access to the stored hub data and the stored hub metadata such as the hub application and or the any of the device applications . The hub application may also be the entry point by which a user creates a new hub and or modifies the membership of an existing hub.

A private interaction hub can be provisioned for any association of people such as family members coworkers friends neighbors and any other people that may be associated together in a hub. Additionally a member user of one private interaction hub may also be a member of multiple hubs which can be based on a single member sign on that identifies the member to the hub operating system service and or to the hub management service . For example a person may be a member of a family hub that associates members of the person s family as well as a member of a neighborhood hub that associates members of the person s neighborhood and a golf hub that associates the person s friends that often golf together.

The integration of the hub application with the operating system of the mobile device provides that a user of the device can view a message or update on the hub user interface and in an application user interface of an application that is associated with the message or the update. For example a hub calendar is integrated with the calendar application e.g. a device application on the mobile device and a calendar update that is displayed in the hub user interface can be selected by the user to initiate the update being displayed in a calendar user interface of the calendar application. Alternatively the user may view the calendar user interface and select a calendar event that is associated with a private interaction hub to initiate a display of the hub calendar which includes the calendar event for the members of the hub. As another example a hub calendar event can be displayed in a hub user interface and the device calendar application can access and display the hub calendar event along with any private data calendar events that only the user of the device has access to view in a user interface of the device calendar application. The hub application and the device application both acquire the same hub calendar event data e.g. the same hub data stored on the mobile device . The two different user interfaces e.g. a hub user interface and a device application user interface display the same calendar event data.

In another example the hub messages and chat features are integrated with messaging applications e.g. the device applications on the mobile device and an email text or instant message that is displayed in the hub user interface can be selected by the user of the mobile device to initiate the message being displayed in a messaging application user interface. Alternatively the user may view a recent message from a member of a private interaction hub in a messaging application user interface and select the message to initiate a display of the hub messages interface such as to view the discussion thread associated with the recent message.

In embodiments the hub operating system service at the mobile device can receive social network updates for the member users of a private interaction hub such as when two or more of the members of a hub are also friends on a public social network site such as e.g. FACEBOOK TWITTER or LINKEDIN . The social network updates can be pulled from a social network site based on the established association of the account identifiers of the hub members of a private interaction hub at the hub management service . The hub operating system service can then aggregate the social network updates for a particular hub for display in the hub user interface or on a homepage live tile associated with the hub. The hub operating system service at the mobile device can also be implemented to coordinate multi user interactive updates to an event that is managed in a private interaction hub. For example several members of a hub may participate in a multi player interactive game and each successive interactive update from a member of the hub is initiated by the member at a respective associated mobile device.

The example system includes a device association service that associates or correlates the client devices by device identifiers user identifiers and or by any other type of identifiable association. Any of the devices and services can communicate via a network which can be implemented to include wired and or wireless networks. The network can also be implemented using any type of network topology and or communication protocol and can be represented or otherwise implemented as a combination of two or more networks to include IP based networks and or the Internet. The network may also include mobile operator networks that are managed by mobile operators such as a communication service provider cell phone provider and or Internet service provider. A mobile operator can facilitate mobile data and or voice communication for any type of a wireless device or mobile phone.

The client devices can each be associated with a different user and the users are defined members of a hub . The example client device is representative of the various client devices in the hub.

In this example the client device includes a hub coordination architecture that implements features of a hub a hub control service that implements features of a hub dashboard a hub check in service a device quiet service that implements features of quiet time and quiet zone a safe driving service and a device sharing service .

Additionally any one or combination of the various client device services may be abstracted for implementation by a network service provider such as the device association service . For example the client devices that are associated in the hub can be interconnected through a central computing device or system e.g. may be one of the client devices which may be local to the multiple devices or may be located remotely from the devices. In embodiments the central computing device may be a cloud service of one or more server computers that are connected to the multiple devices via the communication network or other communication link. The interconnection architecture enables functionality across multiple devices to provide a common and seamless experience to a user of the multiple devices. Each of the client devices may have different physical configurations and capabilities and the central computing device implements a platform to enable delivery of an experience that is both tailored to a particular device and yet common to all of the devices.

In this example of the client device services the hub coordination architecture includes a hub manager that implements coordinates and or manages various hub features such as hub calendar hub chat hub shared contacts hub journal and memories tasks and chores hub keys and hub budget . The hub control service implements features such as a hub dashboard manager age appropriate content control and safe social networking . The device quiet service implements features such as quiet time and quiet zone . The various client device services and features are further described throughout the document.

The computer readable storage media can include various implementations of random access memory RAM read only memory ROM flash memory and other types of storage media in various memory device configurations.

Generally computer readable storage media is representative of media and or devices that enable persistent and or non transitory storage of data in contrast to mere signal transmission carrier waves or signals per se. A computer readable signal media may refer to a signal bearing medium that transmits instructions such as via a network. The signal media can embody computer readable instructions as data in a modulated data signal such as carrier waves or other transport mechanism.

The computer readable storage media provides storage of the device data and various device applications such as an operating system that is maintained as a software application with the computer readable storage media and executed by the processing system . In this example the device applications also include an hub operating system service that implements embodiments of private interaction hubs such as when the example device is implemented as the client device shown in .
