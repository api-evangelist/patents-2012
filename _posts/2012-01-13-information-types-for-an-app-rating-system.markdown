The instant application claims priority to and is a Continuation In Part CIP of commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 293 826 titled APP RATING SYSTEM filed on Nov. 10 2011 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Electronic games have grown in popularity and complexity over the years. In particular certain types of electronic games include game experiences which mimic or track real life activities such as sports hobbies etc. These games are provided by computer applications hosted by local servers and or by servers in the World Wide Web that allow users to participate on line among a group of participants interested in the same type of gameplay. Other types of electronic games are related to the convergence between media content companies and electronic game companies. Traditional media content such as movies or television shows normally designed for pure viewer consumption are now including an interactive component similar to video games ranging from companion and supplemental information for media content available online through a mobile device to actually changing a storyline for a show in response to electronic viewer feedback.

This increased array of electronic game type activity has given rise to various software applications that assist users in processing information related to and or necessary for gameplay. A user of an electronic game may need assistance with various aspects of gameplay including but not limited to advanced instruction tutorials player information processing statistical analyses etc. Applications offered by the game manufacturers as well as third parties provide a means to provide this assistance. For example participants in fantasy sports games receive volumes of statistical information related to the performance of real life athletes that comprise one or more fantasy teams. Users must analyze this information in making roster and or strategy decisions on a regular basis during the fantasy sports season which necessitates additional time and attention by the participant. Certain applications directed at one or more of these types of electronic games may be available to a participant that processes this information and or provide an automatic interface with certain aspects of gameplay. For example an app may be configured to retrieve quarterback ratings for real life players on a weekly basis and process these ratings to provide rankings of quarterbacks based on custom point allocations for a particular fantasy football league or game. It would be useful for an electronic game participant to be provided with an evaluation of these applications for use with electronic gameplay based on an objective assessment of utility. This would provide participants with quick access to information on which applications provide utility to gameplay thereby enhancing the gaming experience. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present improvements have been needed.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview and it is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various embodiments are generally directed to an app rating system. Some embodiments are particularly directed to techniques to rate particular apps based on performance information of game play of an electronic game to which the app is associated. In one embodiment for example an apparatus may comprise a processor circuit and an app rating application operative on the processor circuit. The app rating application is operative to receive performance information and an app identifier parameter associated with a competitive event such as for example an electronic game. The app rating application is operative to output an app rating indicator of an app corresponding to the app identifier parameter based on the performance information to assist a user in selecting the app for one or more electronic games.

In one embodiment for example a computer implemented method comprises determining whether a user of an electronic game utilizes an app in game play based on user identifier information and an app identifier parameter. An app rating indicator associated with the app is determined based on the received game performance information.

To accomplish the foregoing and related ends certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be practiced and all aspects and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

Various embodiments are generally directed to an app rating system used in connection with electronic games. As used herein the term app is an abbreviation for an application and means a software program that can run on a computer or similar processing device designed to perform certain tasks or functions by itself in combination with and or as a compliment to another software application such as for example an electronic game. For the purposes of this disclosure when the term app is used separately from the term application it is intended to refer to two separate software programs and or app is intended to distinguish one application from another application .

The gaming mechanics described herein can be used in any sort of game and gaming mechanics where a platform utilizes data from a real time gaming situation with the same rules functions and mechanics described herein to simulate a new game based upon the same rules and mechanics with the same data and or different data that is being supplied in a different way for a different purpose depending on the type of game. For example the gaming mechanics may comprise any electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate multimedia feedback on an electronic platform such as a computing device video game console handheld computer arcade machine and so forth. The games may include any genre based on many factors such as game play types of goals art style and more and may include without limitation graphic adventures point and click adventures text adventures sports first person adventures first person shooters comic adventures anime adventures reality interactive television based games and so forth. It may be appreciated that any number of different games and gaming mechanics may be implemented for a given game that provides assistance to the user participant to facilitate game play. However the embodiments are not limited in this context.

As used herein the term electronic game refers to any game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play at least a portion of the game. There are various general categories of electronic games. One category of electronic games includes games that are completely played on some form of a personal or local electronic device such as a personal computer smart phone etc. Examples may include without limitation electronic video games electronic audio games electronic tactile games electronic board games handheld electronic games and so forth. Another category includes electronic games that may be partially played on some form of a personal electronic device and partially played on a centralized or server based platform. In other words an entire game does not necessarily need to be played on a personal electronic device but rather utilizes the personal electronic device to play a portion of the game and the server based platform manages various game activities for one or more users. For example the second category may include live entertainment shows e.g. television shows reality television shows game shows award shows etc. with one or more contestants playing a game with an electronic component to play a portion of or as a compliment to the game and or fantasy sports games or leagues that utilizes one or more game servers as the central processing facility for gameplay. These are merely a few examples of first and second categories for electronic games other implementations exist as well. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Some embodiments are particularly directed to techniques for automatically determining an app rating indicator associated with an app used in combination with a particular electronic game based on the performance of a user of that electronic game. In one embodiment an app rating may be provided to a user by displaying the rating with an app icon on an app store web page. The app rating is determined by the app rating system based on game performance information of users of that electronic game that have downloaded the particular app. Embodiments are not limited in this context.

Automatically presenting app rating information to assist a user of an electronic game in selecting which of several available apps is associated with better game performance has several advantages over conventional solutions. For instance conventional solutions typically require that a user purchase an app for a particular electronic game before being able to sample the app during gameplay. If a user purchases an app to assist with electronic gameplay and the user does not find it helpful then the user has wasted both money and time with the app. In addition certain app stores may provide user reviews associated with an app. However user reviews are subjective interpretations from different users of the quality and or utility of the app. Moreover these reviews may be provided by users that have varying degrees of game experience and expertise which may compromise the usefulness of the reviews. Automatically providing app rating information based on game performance information provides an objective quantifiable indication of the usefulness and quality of the app which reduces or eliminates unnecessary app purchases used with particular electronic games. As a result a user may have an improved gaming experience.

Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident however that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the claimed subject matter.

The system comprises the app rating application that may generally be arranged to automatically manage app rating information for one or more electronic games. The app rating application may receive as input game performance information representing gameplay by a user of an electronic game. The app rating application may process the game performance information to determine a rating of an app used in combination with the electronic game and provide an app rating indicator based on the game performance information. The app rating application may then send as output the app rating indicator for a particular app to an app store server to be displayed with the app to assist a user in selecting among a plurality of apps associated with a particular electronic game.

Game performance information may generally comprise any information or metadata available from one or more network devices accessible by the app rating system and useful in determining the performance e.g. wins losses ties of a user playing an electronic game utilizing an app. Examples of game performance information may include without limitation wins losses ties and other similar types of competitive results associated with gameplay of the electronic game. The game performance information may be provided by individual user client devices that run electronic games thereon that communicate with app rating system or from individual user client devices that run in combination with a game server accessible by the app rating system and or may be provided by a game server e.g. shown in which facilitates game play by a user where users access the game server via one or more web pages. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In various embodiments game performance information may comprise two general types of information. In one embodiment for example type one game performance information may comprise direct forms of information hereinafter direct information . In one embodiment for example type two game performance information may comprise indirect forms of information hereinafter indirect information . The term direct refers to information that explicitly evidences to some defined degree of certainty that a particular app improves performance of a fantasy player without any further need of inferences or assumptions. The term indirect refers to information that implicitly evidences a particular app improves performance of a fantasy player while utilizing one or more inferences or assumptions. It may be appreciated that these are merely two exemplary types of game performance information and other types of game performance information may be used as well. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Direct information is any information helpful in objectively quantifying how an app improves performance of a fantasy player. Direct information may include for example information measuring an outcome of a fantasy game or a fantasy league played by a fantasy player such as a win loss or tie information. For instance assume a fantasy player purchases an app designed to select a starting lineup for a fantasy game. Further assume the fantasy player has a win percentage of fantasy games of 49 prior to purchasing the app and a win percentage of 61 after purchasing the app. Utilizing known statistical analysis techniques to filter out external variables the 12 improvement in fantasy player performance may be analyzed to determine whether this improvement is directly attributable to the fantasy player actually using the app versus other external reasons e.g. easier league different sport luck etc. with a relatively high level of confidence. Other information may be used to increase or decrease this confidence level. For instance assume it is know that the fantasy player actually utilized the app in each of the fantasy games played after purchasing the app. This information combined with the 12 increase in win percentage may increase the confidence level of the analysis.

Indirect information is any information helpful in objectively quantifying performance of a fantasy player. An inference may then be combined with the indirect information to estimate or predict how an app improves performance of the fantasy player. Indirect information may include for example information measuring performance or activity of a fantasy player outside of direct information described above. Examples of indirect information may include without limitation player ratings player rankings player classifications player professional activities player social activities player identifiers types of fantasy games played by a fantasy player fantasy leagues joined by a fantasy player fantasy roles performed by a fantasy player associations between fantasy players fantasy apps used by a fantasy player non fantasy apps used by a fantasy player number of apps used by a fantasy player equipment used by a fantasy player recommendations for a fantasy player made by other fantasy players and so forth. The embodiments are not limited to these examples.

In one embodiment indirect information may comprise player rating information. For example assume a source provides periodically aperiodically or continuously calculates ratings for a fantasy player. The source may be a fantasy game provider or an independent third party. For instance assume a source utilizes a rating algorithm to rate performance of a fantasy player based on a number of fantasy sports played by the fantasy player during some time period e.g. per year with a higher number of fantasy sports providing a higher rating for the fantasy player. In another example assume a rating algorithm performs ratings based on difficulty of a league. A league played by former professional athletes or professional fantasy gamers would be more challenging than a league played by random fantasy players. A fantasy player playing in a more difficult league may therefore have a higher rating relative to a fantasy player playing in a less difficult league. In yet another example assume a rating algorithm performs ratings based on a number of articles or blogs published by a fantasy player. A fantasy player that takes the time to write articles or blog posts and publishes this to other fantasy players may have a higher level of insight into strategy of a fantasy game. A fantasy player publishing a higher number of articles or blogs may have a higher rating relative to a fantasy player publishing a lower number of articles or blogs. These are merely a few examples of indirect information and others exist as well. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

These and other types of indirect information may be used separately or combined to output a player rating. The player rating may then be combined with an inference that a higher player rating indicates a better fantasy player. Another inference is a better fantasy player selects better apps. Therefore an app purchased by a fantasy player with a higher rating is a better application relative to an app purchased by a fantasy player with a lower rating. A set of defined thresholds may be set to trigger different outcomes based on player ratings. For instance assume a fantasy player has a player rating of 7.8 on a scale from 1 10. A defined threshold of 9.0 or above may be set to indicate an A rating a defined threshold of 8.0 to 8.9 may be set to indicate a B rating a defined threshold of 7.0 to 7.9 may indicate a C rating and so forth. In this case the player rating of 7.8 may indicate a C level fantasy player. An app purchased by a C level fantasy player would not be as good as an app purchased by an A level fantasy player assuming the inference that better players select better apps is true.

In one embodiment indirect information may comprise player ranking information. For example assume a source provides periodically aperiodically or continuously calculates player ratings for a fantasy player and then ranks fantasy players based on the respective player ratings in some defined order e.g. highest to lowest . Unlike player ratings by themselves which indicate performance of single fantasy player player ranking information indicates relative performance of a fantasy player within a defined group of fantasy players. For instance assume player ratings are used to rank fantasy players of a group of fantasy players participating in a fantasy game such as fantasy soccer. These fantasy players may be ranked based on their respective player ratings in some order such as 1 to N where 1 is the highest ranking and N is the lowest ranking.

These and other types of indirect information may be used separately or combined to output a player ranking. The player ranking may then be combined with an inference that a higher player ranking indicates a better fantasy player. Another inference is a better fantasy player selects better apps. Therefore an app purchased by a fantasy player with a higher ranking is a better application relative to an app purchased by a fantasy player with a lower ranking. A set of defined thresholds may be set to trigger different outcomes based on player ratings. For instance assume a fantasy player has a player ranking in a first quartile while another fantasy player has a player ranking in the last quartile. An app purchased by a first quartile fantasy player would be better than an app purchased by fourth quartile fantasy player assuming the inference that better players select better apps is true.

In one embodiment indirect information may comprise player classification information. For example assume a source provides periodically aperiodically or continuously calculates player classifications for a fantasy player. Similar to player rankings player classifications indicate different classes of fantasy players. The player classifications may utilize a classifier algorithm to combine player ratings information player ranking information and other sorts of indirect information. For instance assume a source defines different classes of fantasy players such as a Professional Class and an Amateur Class. To be classified as a Professional Class fantasy player a fantasy player needs to have played fantasy games for at least 10 years participated in a highest defined league for the last 5 of the 10 years have an average player rating of 9.0 or higher have an average player ranking in the top 5 and won a championship in at least two different fantasy games e.g. fantasy football and fantasy baseball . All other fantasy players are by default placed in the Amateur Class.

These and other types of indirect information may be used separately or combined to output a player classification. The player classification may then be combined with an inference that a fantasy player in a higher class indicates a better fantasy player. Another inference is a better fantasy player selects better apps. Therefore an app purchased by a fantasy player with a higher player classification is a better application relative to an app purchased by a fantasy player with a lower player classification. For instance assume a fantasy player is in a Professional Class while another fantasy player is in an Amateur Class. An app purchased by a Professional Class fantasy player would be better than an app purchased by an Amateur Class fantasy player assuming the inference that better players select better apps is true.

In addition to player rating information player ranking information and player classification information other types of indirect information may be used to quantify performance of a fantasy player either by refining the player rating ranking or classification information or independently of the player rating ranking and classification information.

In one embodiment indirect information such as player professional activities e.g. occupation may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. Presumably a professional soccer player would be a better fantasy soccer player than a dentist who never played soccer in the past.

In one embodiment indirect information such as player social activities e.g. golf may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. A social golfer would be a better fantasy golf player than a non golfer.

In one embodiment indirect information such as types of fantasy games played by a fantasy player e.g. sports versus politics may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. A fantasy player having previous playing experience in fantasy sports may perform better than a fantasy player having previous playing experience in fantasy politics in fantasy sports games.

In one embodiment indirect information such as skill level of fantasy games played by a fantasy player e.g. lower complexity versus higher complexity may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. A fantasy player participating in fantasy games needing a higher skill level may perform better than a fantasy player participating in fantasy games aimed at lower skilled players.

In one embodiment indirect information such as number of fantasy leagues joined by a fantasy player e.g. 1 versus 4 professional versus amateur etc. may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. A fantasy player participating in a higher number of leagues or more competitive leagues may be a better fantasy player than a fantasy player participating in a lower number of leagues.

In one embodiment indirect information such as number or frequency of web site visits by a fantasy player e.g. once a week versus once a day may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. A fantasy player visiting a web site offering fantasy game services more often may be a better fantasy player than a fantasy player visiting a web site less often.

In one embodiment indirect information such as fantasy roles performed by a fantasy player e.g. league organizer league commissioner league commentator league referee league coordinator etc. may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. Higher level roles may indicate a higher level of involvement and interest in fantasy games thereby indicating a better fantasy player.

In one embodiment indirect information such as associations between fantasy players e.g. friends or social networks may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. Good fantasy players tend to gravitate towards each other due to a higher level of common interest. Therefore a friend of a known good fantasy player may be assumed to be a same caliber of fantasy player as the known fantasy player.

In one embodiment indirect information such as fantasy apps used by a fantasy player e.g. team drafting apps team management apps team player analyzers etc. may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. Some fantasy games are highly competitive. Once a good fantasy player acquires an app and experiences higher levels of success other fantasy players learn about the success and attempt to obtain the same apps to increase their competitive edge. Therefore when multiple high level fantasy players are all using the same app it is typically an indicator that the app is a better than other apps. Therefore apps of a fantasy player may be an indicator of a playing ability of a fantasy player. The same may be true for non fantasy apps. For instance if a superior fantasy player always utilizes a certain spreadsheet app to maintain fantasy sport statistics and other fantasy players of similar caliber use the same spreadsheet app then the spreadsheet app may be an indicator of player performance.

In one embodiment indirect information such as number of apps used by a fantasy player e.g. 2 versus 10 apps may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. If a stronger fantasy player typically uses 5 or more apps while a weaker fantasy player typically uses 4 or less apps the number of apps may be used as an indicator of player performance.

In one embodiment indirect information such as equipment used by a fantasy player e.g. operating system computing platform communications transceiver etc. may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. If a stronger fantasy player typically uses a certain OS on a certain device e.g. a smart phone while a weaker fantasy player typically uses a different OS on a different device e.g. a desktop computer the type of equipment may be used as an indicator of player performance.

In one embodiment indirect information such as recommendations for a fantasy player made by other fantasy players e.g. likes dislikes comments etc. may be strong indicators of fantasy player performance. For instance if a fantasy player s comments consistently receive a higher number of likes than dislikes as measured by some ratio this may indicate a better fantasy player.

It is worthy to note that to the extent embodiments of the app rating application as described below make reference to app ratings derived using direct information e.g. wins losses ties etc. it may be appreciated that the embodiments may generate app ratings e.g. app rating indictor derived using one or more types of indirect information or a combination of one or more types of direct information and one or more types of indirect information using techniques similar to those described with reference to direct information. Any number and combination of direct and indirect types of information may be used to generate app ratings. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In addition to the above described matching of fantasy players based on the presumption that better players pick better apps indirection information may be combined with a presumption that fantasy players of the same skill level may choose similar apps. Such choices may be due to the level of detail of information provided to the fantasy player e.g. simpler interface with less variables to consider may be more effective for the less sophisticated fantasy player . In addition such factors as specific features or functionality associated with certain types of apps may infer a preferred type of app for a category of fantasy player who uses such apps. For example if certain less sophisticated fantasy players gravitate toward a category of apps that utilize recommendation features that help the fantasy player make decisions on how to manage his fantasy sports team then other applications that have similar features and functionality may be preferred by fantasy players with a similar skillset level. Similarly if there is a degree of involvement certain fantasy players may have with engaging with the fantasy sport team e.g. someone who only manages his her team on the weekends such fantasy players may have similar apps that help with achieving this goal e.g. not having to manage the fantasy sport team during the weekday due to automation features that are available with the app recommended to that fantasy player. Such skillset level as well as use case behavior can be used to not only recommend similar apps that other fantasy players with similar skill and or behavior may desire but also to help provide feedback to app developers as to what sorts of features are popular or unpopular in order to help app developers enhance their apps. It may be appreciated that these are merely a few examples that illustrate how monitoring success preferences use case scenarios and other characteristics of the fantasy player can be used to help facilitate the matching of apps with fantasy players with similar characteristics.

In the illustrated embodiment shown in the app rating application may include a game performance monitor component an app rating component and an app ranking component . It may be appreciated that more or less components may be used for a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context. The game performance monitor component may generally be arranged to receive monitor or otherwise collect game performance information from a game server and or from a plurality of user client devices playing the electronic game. The game performance information may comprise direct information indirect information or some combination of direct information and indirect information. The game performance information may be real time information delayed information or historical information. The game performance monitor component may monitor game performance information on a periodic continuous or on demand basis. The game monitor component may analyze received game performance information and determine the success failure of gameplay of one or more users employing a particular app. When game performance information for a user is received by the game performance monitor component the game performance monitor component analyzes the information to determine if an app is employed by the user based on a user profile stored in datastore as described in more detail with reference to . The game performance information is aggregated based on the type of electronic game and associated gameplay. The game performance monitor component may perform any processing needed for the game performance information e.g. formatting data schema translations etc. in order to allow the performance information to be aggregated.

The app rating application may comprise an app rating component which is generally arranged to calculate an app rating based on the received aggregated game performance information from the game performance monitor component . The app rating component processes the aggregated game performance information based on one or more weighting factors dependent on the type of aggregated game performance information and the type of electronic game. The app rating application outputs an app rating indicator based on the weighted aggregated game performance information and sends the app rating indicator to an app store server and or to a game server on which the related electronic game is managed. In this manner the app rating component generates an app rating indicator that assists users in selecting apps associated with particular electronic games based on objective and quantifiable game performance information.

The app rating application may also comprise an app ranking component which communicates with the app rating component to receive the app rating indicator and assign an app ranking parameter to the app based on the app ranking parameter and the particular electronic game associated with the app. In this manner apps used for the same electronic game may be ranked and compared by a user interested in acquiring an app to assist with gameplay.

In one exemplary use scenario the electronic game may be a fantasy sports game run on one or more servers and accessed by a plurality of participants to form one or more fantasy sports leagues. The fantasy sports game utilizes statistics from real life players in athletic competitions where participants select these real life players in various positions to form fantasy teams. Each real life sport includes commonly used statistics which translate into points associated with the fantasy sports game. Each fantasy team in the fantasy league may compete against all the other teams in the fantasy league head to head style in scheduled matchups or accumulate points based on player statistics in chosen categories throughout the season rotisserie style or ranked style . Success of a particular fantasy team in the fantasy league is determined by the cumulative number of points obtained by each of the fantasy players corresponding to the performance of the real life players during the real life athletic competitions.

One or more game users may utilize a particular app to assist with gameplay of such a fantasy sports game. For example a user may employ an app that ranks real life players by position according to a point allocation customized for a particular fantasy sports league. In particular an app may be configured to automatically receive real life player statistics corresponding to a game user s fantasy player in real time and provide a preview of the user s team point total by position. In this scenario the app may need to communicate with the game server to identify the customized point allocation for the fantasy league as well as downloading the user s current player roster in order to calculate a preview of a team point total by position. The game performance monitor component receives game performance information from either the client device of the user or from the fantasy sports game server. In this exemplary use scenario for example the game performance information represents direct information such as the wins losses and ties of the fantasy sports game by the user that employs the particular app. The app rating component calculates an app rating indicator based on the game performance information received from game performance monitor component and sends this app rating indicator to an app server from which the particular app may be purchased or otherwise downloaded by a different user. In this manner the app rating indicator signifies whether or not a user that employs a particular app demonstrated gameplay success which provides objective evidence of the app s utility to a different user interested in selecting the app.

In one embodiment for example the game performance parameters may include a user identifier parameter a game identifier parameter a game event parameter and game performance parameters . It may be appreciated that more or less parameters may be used for a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

A user identifier parameter may comprise some form of unique identifier for a user. Examples of a user identifier parameter may include without limitation a user name a user identifier a screen name a login identifier a gamer tag a gamer account a user globally unique identifier GUID user metadata and so forth.

A game identifier parameter may comprise a unique identifier for an electronic game such as for example a fantasy sports game electronic video game etc. Examples of a game identifier parameter may include without limitation a game name a game identifier a game serial number a game version number a game service identifier game badges game achievements game awards a game character a game genre a game theme a game account game metadata a game GUID and so forth.

A game event parameter may comprise a unique identifier for a game event of an electronic game. A game event may comprise a discrete portion of an electronic game. For example a game event for a fantasy sports game may be a season one or more games within a season a portion of a game and or one or more playoff games. Examples of a game event parameter may include without limitation a game event name a game event identifier a game event badge a game event achievement a game event award a game event character a game event genre a game event theme game event metadata a game event GUID and so forth.

In one embodiment game performance parameters may comprise performance characteristics for a game event parameter of an electronic game. In this case the game performance parameters may represent direct information such as success and failure information for a particular game or game event associated with a game event parameter . For example game performance parameters may include without limitation wins losses and ties of an electronic game or game event. In the exemplary scenario mentioned above for a fantasy sports game such as for example fantasy football a game event may be a football season and the performance parameters may be the number of wins losses and ties of a user s fantasy football team during the season representing the game event parameter . As a further example a game event may be a football game and the game performance parameters may be whether or not the user s fantasy football team won the individual game representing the game event parameter .

In one embodiment game performance characteristics may comprise performance characteristics of a fantasy player for a game event parameter of an electronic game as identified by a user identifier parameter for example. In this case the game performance parameters may represent indirect information such as values representing player ratings player rankings player classifications player professional activities player social activities player identifiers types of fantasy games played by a fantasy player fantasy leagues joined by a fantasy player fantasy roles performed by a fantasy player associations between fantasy players fantasy apps used by a fantasy player non fantasy apps used by a fantasy player number of apps used by a fantasy player equipment used by a fantasy player recommendations for a fantasy player made by other fantasy players and so forth.

The game performance monitor component receives an app identifier parameter from a user profile stored in data store . The app identifier parameter is based on the information stored in user profile corresponding to the user identifier parameter . Each time a user obtains an app associated with a particular electronic game the app identifier parameter is stored in the user profile associated with the particular electronic game having a game identifier parameter . The user identifier parameter is supplied to game performance monitor component which performs a check against the information in the user profile to determine if the user corresponding to the user identifier parameter is employing an app in connection with gameplay of the particular electronic game based on the game identifier parameter . If the user is employing an app in connection with gameplay of the particular electronic game the app identifier parameter from user profile is requested by and supplied to the game performance component . If the user is not employing an app in connection with gameplay of the particular electronic game then the app identifier parameter is not stored in user profile and the game performance monitor component does not retrieve the game performance parameters . In addition the game event parameter defines for particular game events the game performance parameters provided to game performance monitor component for aggregation. In particular a game event parameter may be different for different electronic games. As noted above a game event parameter may be an individual game season portion of a season and or portion of an individual game for example and therefore the game performance parameters may correspond to wins losses and or ties for an individual game season portion of a season and or portion of an individual game.

The game performance monitor component receives a set of one or more game performance parameters and generates aggregated performance parameters . The aggregated performance parameters may comprise an aggregated value of a user s wins losses and or ties associated with an electronic game and a conversion of the aggregated value of a user s wins losses and or ties to a corresponding percentage of games played corresponding to the game event parameter . Game performance monitor component aggregates the game performance parameters e.g. wins losses and ties and converts the aggregated value to a win percentage for an electronic game associated with the app identifier parameter . For example one aggregated performance parameter may be calculated using the following equation for game performance parameter representing wins losses and ties in the fantasy sports exemplary scenario Win pct wins ties 2 wins losses ties . Eq. 1 Again the values associated with wins losses and ties are based on the game event parameter and may represent for example wins losses and ties of an individual game a group of games a season etc. It may be appreciated that different equations may be used for a given electronic game corresponding to a game identifier parameter for various game event parameters and for particular game performance parameters . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

For certain electronic games a greater aggregated value may be associated with wins losses and or ties in a playoff and or championship context versus a regular game context. As such the aggregated performance parameters may further comprise a playoff ratio as well as a championship ratio for a user of a particular electronic game corresponding to the game identifier parameter and app identifier parameter . For example one aggregated performance parameter may be calculated using the following equation for game performance parameter representing a playoff ratio in the above mentioned fantasy sports exemplary scenario Playoff ratio of playoff teams total teams using app Eq. 2 This game performance parameter quantifies by providing a ratio or percentage the success of a user making the playoffs as compared to the number of playoff teams within a particular league. In addition a user may have more than one team within a particular electronic game. Thus the playoff ratio is based on the number of teams using a particular app rather than the number of users employing the app. As a further example another aggregated performance parameter may be calculated using the following equation for game performance parameter representing a championship ratio in the fantasy sports exemplary scenario Champions ratio of champion teams total teams using app Eq. 3 This game performance parameter quantifies by providing a ratio or percentage of the number of championship teams as compared to the total number of teams using a particular app. Since only a certain number of teams may obtain a championship status with the electronic game this game performance parameter may receive a greater weight when calculating the aggregated performance parameter . Again it may be appreciated that different equations may be used for a given electronic game and for particular game performance parameters . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In the illustrated embodiment shown in the operating environment receives the aggregated performance parameters from the game performance monitor component . For example the app rating component receives the wins losses ties percentages the playoff ratio and the championship ratio and calculates the app rating indicator . Since the aggregated performance parameters are associated with a particular app based on the app identifier parameter the app rating component calculates the app rating indicator for the particular app and stores the indicator in datastore . The app rating indicator associated with the particular app may also be sent to an app server on which the app associated with the electronic game is available to a user for download to use in combination with gameplay. In this manner the app rating indicator provides a different user with objective quantifiable information about the utility of the app since the app rating indicator is based on gameplay performance of other users that employ the app rather than subjective user review information.

The determination of the app rating indicator may be accomplished by app rating component by applying the weighting factor to one or more of the aggregated performance parameters and combining these weighted performance parameters. The weighting factor may be stored in datastore and may be associated with a particular electronic game and or a particular app. The application of various weighting factors may be applied to the aggregated performance parameters based on for example the type of electronic game and or app as well as based on a game event parameter . In particular game event parameter that represents performance over a longer period of time may receive a greater weighting factor applied to the aggregated performance parameters as compared to performance over a shorter period of time.

In addition the playoff ratio and championship ratio may be combined with the wins losses ties percentages and a weighting factor is applied to the championship ratio since performance of a user associated with the championship ratio demonstrates additional success above the wins losses ties percentages of a regular game. Alternatively the playoff ratio and championship ratio may be combined with the wins losses ties percentages and a weighting factor is applied to the playoff ratio . As a further alternative the playoff ratio and championship ratio may be combined with the wins losses ties percentages and a negative weighting factor is applied to the wins losses ties ratio since performance of a user associated with the wins losses ties percentages may hold less performance weight than either the playoff ratio or championship ratio . Depending on the type of electronic game associated with the aggregated performance parameters different weighting factors may be applied to output an app rating indictor for a particular app.

As previously described with reference to the operating environment the app rating component generates an app rating indicator for each app corresponding to the app identifier parameter associated with a particular electronic game. The app rating component is based on the aggregated performance parameters which provides a rating corresponding to objective user performance through gameplay of the electronic game. The app rating indicators are supplied to app ranking component which receives the app identifier parameter from datastore to generate the app ranking parameter for each app. The app ranking component compares the app rating indicators associated with a plurality of apps for an electronic game and assigns an app ranking parameter to the app based on the value of each of the app rating indicators . The frequency by which the app ranking component generates the app ranking parameter may be defined by the number of app ranking indicators received within a given time period and or may be based on the number of game event parameters received by game performance monitor component . The app ranking parameters may be sent to an app server and displayed with the corresponding app. In addition the app ranking parameters may also be stored in datastore . In this manner a user may view app ranking parameters in view of other app ranking parameters associated with other apps available for download for an electronic game. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

A communications network may be any one and the combination of wired and or wireless networks including without limitation a direct interconnection a secured custom connection a private network e.g. an enterprise intranet a public network e.g. the Internet a Personal Area Network PAN a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet OMNI a Wide Area Network WAN a wireless network a cellular network and other communications networks.

Some embodiments may be described using the expression one embodiment or an embodiment along with their derivatives. These terms mean that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further some embodiments may be described using the expression coupled and connected along with their derivatives. These terms are not necessarily intended as synonyms for each other. For example some embodiments may be described using the terms connected and or coupled to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. The term coupled however may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other.
