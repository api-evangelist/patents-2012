This application is related to and derives priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 528 820 filed on 30 Aug. 2011 and titled Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering SERS Based Nanostructured Apparatus Method and Applications the subject matter of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.

The research underlying the embodiments described herein and the invention claimed herein was funded by the United States National Institutes of Health under grant number R21EB007031 and the United States National Science Foundation under grant number ECS 0876771. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

Embodiments of the invention generally relate to the field of molecular spectroscopy and particularly to apparatus and fabrication and analysis methods associated with surface enhanced Raman scattering SERS . More particularly embodiments relate to particular nanostructured substrates their fabrication and their use in enhanced molecular spectroscopy analysis.

The high sensitivity and potential for label free analysis associated with surface enhanced Raman scattering SERS spectroscopy has made it an attractive analytical technique for applications ranging from DNA sequencing to pathogen identification. However acquisition of reproducible SERS spectroscopic analyses over large areas often requires nanostructured substrate arrays with precisely controlled shapes and sizes. Uniformity of the nanostructured substrates over large scales is important since Raman signal intensity is often extremely sensitive to the size shape and morphology of the nanostructures on a substrate.

Thus given the desirability of SERS analysis in various fields nanostructured substrates and their methods for manufacture with enhanced nanostructure uniformity that provides enhanced surface enhanced Raman scattering properties are also desirable.

Non limiting embodiments of the invention include various SERS enhanced nanostructured substrates each having different nanostructures created by adjusting fabrication parameters a method for fabricating the SERS enhanced nanostructured substrate and a SERS detection method that uses the SERS enhanced nanostructured substrate.

Associated with the foregoing SERS enhanced nanostructured substrate and related methods are novel and reproducible nanostructures. Moreover the embodiments provide a high throughput method for creating uniform large area and flexible SERS active substrates. Flexible and large area SERS substrates are useful because they can be more easily incorporated into irregularly shaped surfaces such as clothing and have greater spatial area for multiplexing. Within the context of the embodiments a method in accordance with the embodiments is referred to as shadow mask assisted evaporation SMAE .

An embodiment of the invention is a composite structure. In an exemplary non limiting aspect the composite structure includes a substrate and an at least 3 3 array of nanostructures disposed on the substrate wherein each nanostructure has an elongate shape and a distal end in the form of an open pointed tip. According to various non limiting aspects the composite structure may be characterized by one or more of the following 

An embodiment of the invention is a method of making a composite structure. In an exemplary non limiting aspect a method for making a composite structure having an at least 3 3 array of nanostructures includes the steps of providing a three dimensional periodically arrayed nano porous template disposing the template in the path of a vaporized metal in an E beam evaporator system at a fixed angle where is equal to or less than 60 degrees relative to the vaporized metal evaporation path axis depositing a desired thickness of the metal on a top surface and at least a portion of an interior surface of each nanopore of the template while controlling a rotation of the template thereby forming a deposited metal nanoarray structure wherein each of the arrayed nanostructures has a pointed distal tip eliminating the template leaving only the remaining deposited metal nanoarray structure and attaching the remaining deposited metal nanoarray structure to a support substrate. According to various non limiting aspects the method may be characterized by one or more of the following steps and or features 

The disclosed embodiments and aspects provide an enhanced SERS substrate a method for fabricating the enhanced SERS substrate and a Raman spectroscopy method that uses the enhanced SERS substrate. In particular the method for fabricating the enhanced SERS substrate uses a SMAE method that utilizes a shadow mask for fabricating reproducible SERS substrates.

An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . shows a schematic of the SMAE process. Briefly gold Au is SMAE deposited on an anodized aluminum oxide AAO nanoporous template at an angle such that at least a portion of the inner walls and the top surface of the nanoporous template will be coated. Following evaporation the AAO nanoporous template is dissolved in a NaOH solution and the surviving metallic nanostructured film is allowed to settle onto the top of a poly dimethylsiloxane PDMS substrate further fabrication details are described below . Large e.g. 27 to 47 mm and theoretically larger see e.g. http www.whatman.com PROD AnoporeInorganicMembranes.aspx nanostructure arrays may be constructed using the embodied technique limited only by the size of the template. This particular SMAE methodology has numerous advantages over competing art including greater simplicity in fabrication lower cost substrate flexibility and relatively larger fabricated area.

Other metals in addition to gold such as silver copper aluminum and combinations thereof may alternatively be deposited on an AAO or other suitable nanoporous template.

As shown in and the placement of the nanostructured film on a PDMS support enables these substrate supported nanoarrays to be robust and highly flexible. In addition to the advantages described above this flexibility may allow the spacing of the nano pillars to be modified by mechanical stress which could be useful for tuning the optical response.

Nano pillars were also performed for a equal to 30 degrees and 60 degrees the results of which can be seen in and respectively. The 30 degree angle of evaporation yielded sharper nanostructures than the 60 degree deposition. However during the dissolution of the AAO membrane the relatively tall and weak pillars tended to collapse see and . For the 60 degree incident angle of evaporation shadowing resulted in shorter and less sharp nano pillars see and than were observed for the 45 degree incident angle of evaporation case. Stronger fields are normally achieved from sharper morphologies. Based on the above results evaporation conditions at an incident angle of 45 degrees and a deposition rate of 0.8 angstroms per second were chosen as the optimal conditions and used for the remainder of the disclosed exemplary embodiments.

To further explore the methodology used to create the nano pillars as illustrated in three additional types of nanostructure arrays were fabricated using the embodied methods. illustrates nano nib shaped type II structures obtained through a double evaporation process. To fabricate this structure 100 nm of silver was first deposited at a 45 degree incident angle. An additional 100 nm of silver was then deposited with a equal to 45 degrees and a substrate rotation speed of 35 rpm. We observed arrays of structures 57 nm in height with 173 25 nm hole diameters as defined in . In another approach nano ellipsoidal cylinder type III structures as illustrated in were fabricated using the same conditions except that the substrate was rotated during the initial metal deposition and then not rotated for the second silver evaporation step. Measured height and hole diameters respectively were 320 35 nm and 165 21 nm. A fourth type of nanostructure was obtained by depositing silver twice with a equal to 45 degrees and 135 degrees. The resulting nano triangular tip structures type IV shown in had a height of 220 24 nm and a hole diameter of 175 27 nm. Table 1 summarizes the fabrication conditions and specifications for the exemplary nanostructures disclosed herein. Although only a small portion of the entire substrate can be imaged wider view SEM images are shown in all nanostructure arrays exhibited high periodicity and uniformity. Various hole sizes can be obtained using different AAO templates e.g. membranes with nanopores ranging from 20 to 200 nm in diameter are commercially available.

Raman signatures were obtained to characterize the relative sensitivity of each nanostructure array in accordance with the foregoing embodiments. As described in greater detail below TAMRA labeled nucleic acid sequences analogous to Dengue virus serotype 2 DENV 2a were used as detection targets. To facilitate biocompatibility prior to conducting the experiments each silver nanostructure e.g. nano pillar as described above was coated with 5 nm of gold. is a graph that shows the SERS spectra obtained from the four different SERS active substrates y axis relative intensity x axis Raman shift cm . In all cases a solution containing 300 nM of the target DNA was pipetted onto the surface. Negative controls were not conducted here as the goal of this experiment was to measure the relative sensitivity of the surfaces using a common sample rather than conduct a formal detection reaction. As expected characteristic Raman peaks for the TAMRA labeled DNA were found at 1640 1573 1482 1385 and 1217 cm. As illustrated in the dashed box in the difference in Raman intensity at 1385 cmwas used for relative sensitivity evaluation. The nano triangular tip type IV and nano ellipsoidal cylinder type III are observed to be the most and least sensitive arrays respectively. Comparing the relative sensitivity of the other structures to the nano ellipsoidal cylinder yielded enhancements of 1.82 0.22 for the nano nib average standard deviation 1.94 0.12 for the nano pillar and 2.4 0.35 for the nano triangular tip structure. Although the nano triangular tip arrays type IV had the greatest enhancement owing to their sharper tip morphology the nano pillar arrays type I showed the most reproducible SERS signals smallest standard deviation . A reason for this greater reproducibility may be because the type I structures are made using a single step fabrication process as opposed to the type IV which uses a double step process .

The Raman signals from the embodied nanostructured surfaces can be further enhanced by integrating them with Au nanoparticles. This may be embodied with the nano pillar array type I substrate as it exhibited the greatest reproducibility. and schematically show how the nanoparticles settle into the nanostructures . The close interaction between the pillars and the nanoparticles causes a coupling of the plasmonic resonances leading to a localized hot spot as has been previously suggested. As shown in and TAMRA labeled DENV 2a was attached to the Au nanospheres not to the Ag SERS active substrate. shows the resulting SERS spectra from the 1 200 nm Au nanoparticles after settling on the surface 2 Ag nano pillar substrate without nanoparticles similar to the type I experiment in for comparison and 3 200 nm Au nanoparticles embedded in the nano pillar arrays. As can be seen integrating the gold nano particles with the nano pillar array yielded a response approximately 50 times higher than the nanoparticle themselves at 1385 cm. Experiments were also conducted using different concentrations of TAMRA labeled target probes 50 M 100 M 250 M and 500 M . As can be seen in the intensity of the peak at 1385 cmincreased linearly with the concentration over this range suggesting that the linear trend in the small concentration range can be used for quantitative analysis as well.

AAO membranes Whatman Anodisc 60 mm thick 200 nm diameter pores were fixed onto a silicon wafer substrate using Kapton tape. The chuck angle was altered from 30 degrees to 60 degrees. Metals gold and silver were deposited using a CVC SC4500 apparatus CVC Inc. NY . After the metal deposition the membranes were detached from the silicon substrate and were immersed in a 3.0 M NaOH solution for 10 min to fully dissolve the AAO sacrificial templates. Following this the metal nanostructure films were dipped in 30 mM 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane MPTMS solution for 2 hours which assists the metal film in adhering to the PDMS. After 2 hours the MPTMS solution was replaced with deionized DI water and a piece of polymerized PDMS was introduced. The DI water was then gently extracted using a micropipette and the thin metal film was allowed to settle onto the top of the PDMS. The final device was dried in an oven at 80 C. for 1 hour.

Raman signatures were measured using a Renishaw in Via Raman spectrometer Renishaw UK coupled to a Leica microscope with a 785 nm laser spectral resolution of approximately 0.1 cm . A 50 NA 0.75 objective lens was used to focus the laser beam onto the sample surface and the scattered signal was collected by a Peltier cooled CCD detector. Wave numbers ranging from 1000 cmto 1800 cmwere examined with respect to the embodiments. Raman signals were obtained from at least three different spots on each nanostructured surface.

Dengue virus serotype 2 DENV 2 was chosen as the target analyte and purchased from Operon Biotechnologies Huntsville Ala. . The target probe of DENV 2a was modified with TAMRA dye and a thiol modifier containing C3 S S functionality. The titrations of TAMRA labeled target probes were prepared by diluting the proper amount of DNA in a 10 mM PBS buffer solution 0.6 MNaCl pH 7.4 . The 200 nm diameter gold nanoparticles were purchased from Nanocs New York N.Y. .

We have demonstrated a new high throughput technique for creating large area flexible SERS active substrates by shadow mask assisted evaporation SMAE . Controlling the evaporation parameters incident angle rotation and deposition rate enabled numerous different topographies to be obtained. We characterized each of these topographies demonstrating that a nano triangular tip has the largest Raman enhancement and a nano pillar tip has the highest repeatability. Integration of these substrates with gold nanoparticles yielded enhanced plasmonic hotspots resulting in a 50 fold improvement over just the nanoparticles themselves.
