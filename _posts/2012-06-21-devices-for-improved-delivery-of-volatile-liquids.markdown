The present invention relates to devices and methods for improved airborne delivery of volatile liquids containing one or more active materials wherein the active material comprises at least one of a fragrance an insecticide a fungicide a pesticide a sanitising material and or a pharmaceutical.

Volatile liquids containing one or more active materials wherein the active material comprises at least one of a fragrance an insecticide a fungicide a pesticide a sanitising material and or a pharmaceutical are delivered within the domestic environment via a variety of mechanisms. Devices are available with heaters disposed therein to increase the rate of emanation from a surface saturated with the liquid such a surface could be a wick saturated with a fragranced liquid and the heater is located adjacent the wick surface and nearby a chimney to heat the liquid on the wick surface and cause it to more readily evaporate and disseminate into the surrounding environment through the chimney.

Alternatively such volatile liquids can be loaded in an aerosol canister the canister holds the liquid under pressure and when the canister valve is opened the liquid is forced out. The liquid is provided with a propellant which evaporates inside the canister to maintain an even pressure and outside the canister assist with the mechanical break up of the liquid by evaporating rapidly. Suitable propellants include volatile hydrocarbons such as propane butane or isobutane.

Aerosols generally provide a satisfactory spray performance but since they require manual operation by a user they are not considered to be particularly convenient for routine use. Automatic aerosol activation devices exist for operation with metered dose aerosols. These devices are operable to periodically actuate the aerosol to cause a dose of the liquid to be sprayed.

Whilst the automation of the device overcomes the problem of manual operation of a canister the use of aerosols containing such propellants is becoming increasingly less desirable since these volatile hydrocarbons carry the disadvantage of being flammable the rising cost of oil is rendering them increasingly expensive and they also carry the further disadvantage of being an atmospheric source of carbon which is deemed to not be environmentally sensitive.

In the field of air freshening it is generally preferred to use a fragranced volatile liquid air freshening liquids comprising several components. These components often possess different volatilities which can lead to emission problems. The effect of fractionation can be particularly pronounced for powered emanation devices using a heater to effect emanation such as a plug in emanation device or the like.

In such device a build up phenomenon can occur in which an accumulation of volatile liquid components with the lowest comparative volatilities can occur leading to an undesirable non uniform emanation profile for the liquid. This phenomenon can produce an olfactory sensation wherein the fragrance character changes over the course of emanation of a quantity of the fragranced volatile liquid such that the high notes of a fragrance are the first to be evaporated when the wicking material is first exposed to the fragranced liquid and the low notes are evaporated thereafter.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a device that is capable of addressing the abovementioned performance drawbacks and other drawbacks that will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art.

According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided therefore an emanation system comprising and emanation device and a replaceable refill of liquid wherein the refill comprises 

a sealed reservoir of a liquid containing one or more active materials wherein the active material comprises at least one of a fragrance an insecticide a fungicide a pesticide a sanitising material and or a pharmaceutical 

a porous wick having a length which extends from the interior of the reservoir to the exterior thereof 

a fluid conduit in fluid communication with the air pump such that in use air pumped by the pump will flow through the fluid conduit 

a liquid conduit engaging member provided adjacent the ejector constriction and in fluid communication with the fluid conduit at one end thereof and configured at the other end to in use engage the hollow liquid conduit in the refill 

characterised in that a mechanism is provided to permit the liquid conduit engagement member to form a liquid tight seal with the liquid conduit.

According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided therefore an emanation system comprising and emanation device and a replaceable refill of liquid wherein the refill comprises 

a sealed reservoir of a liquid containing one or more active materials wherein the active material comprises at least one of a fragrance an insecticide a fungicide a pesticide a sanitising material and or a pharmaceutical 

a porous wick having a length which extends from the interior of the reservoir to the exterior thereof 

a reservoir seal having at least two apertures wherein the wick extends through one of the apertures and

a hollow liquid conduit which extends from the interior of the reservoir to engage with one of the apertures 

a fluid conduit in fluid communication with the air pump such that in use air pumped by the pump will flow through the fluid conduit 

a liquid conduit engaging member provided adjacent the ejector constriction and in fluid communication with the fluid conduit at one end thereof and configured at the other end to in use engage the hollow liquid conduit in the refill 

characterised in that a mechanism is provided to permit the liquid conduit engagement member to form a liquid tight seal with the liquid conduit.

Devices according to either the first of second aspect of the present invention have been found to be particularly advantageous as they are capable of spraying the volatile liquid at a uniform consistency thus avoiding the drawbacks of fractionation and or build up phenomena.

The mechanism is preferably arranged to permit the liquid conduit engagement member to move in a generally downward direction toward an open end of the liquid conduit when the refill is loaded in the device.

Alternatively the mechanism may be arranged to permit refill securing means to move in a generally upward direction toward the liquid conduit engagement member to engage with the liquid conduit when a refill is loaded in the device.

As a further alternative the mechanism may be arranged to permit refill securing means to move in a generally upward direction toward the liquid conduit engagement member and substantially simultaneously therewith the mechanism also permits the liquid conduit engagement member to move in a generally downward direction toward the refill such dual movement permitting the liquid conduit engagement member to engage with the liquid conduit when a refill is loaded in the device.

Preferably the end of the liquid conduit engagement member is inwardly tapered and or the open end of the liquid conduit is outwardly tapered to permit an ease of engagement therebetween.

Preferably the mechanism is motorised and can be activated by a user input to the device to instruct the mechanism to cause the liquid conduit engagement member to engage with the liquid conduit and vice versa.

Alternatively or additionally the mechanism may be operated by a user moving components of the device to cause the liquid conduit engagement member to engage with the liquid conduit and vice versa.

The liquid conduit is preferably made from a rigid or substantially rigid material such as a metal alloy or plastics material this may be advantageous in allowing said conduit to penetrate the wick.

The hollow liquid conduit in the first aspect of the present invention is provided with length that is substantially identical to the length of the wick this is advantageous as it permits the manufacture of the wick and conduit to be less expensive as it can be manufactured together and or cut into desired lengths together.

The hollow liquid conduit in the second aspect of the present invention is preferably provided with length that permits it to extend between the extremity of the reservoir remote to the seal and the seal with the conduit preferably terminating at or adjacent the seal.

The refill may be made from a reservoir that is partially or completely transparent thus allowing a user to monitor the liquid level therein. Preferably the reservoir is made from glass or a substantially rigid plastics material.

The reservoir seal is preferably sized to correspond to the diameter or cross section of the wick thus securely holding the wick in a fixed position whilst substantially maintaining a liquid seal to substantially or completely prevent the leaking of liquid from the reservoir.

The refill is preferably provided with a removable cap that surrounds the plug and the protruding wick to protect the wick and prevent emanation of the volatile liquid from the wick until emanation of the volatile liquid is required.

The wick is preferably made from a wrapped fibrous material such as wrapped cellulose or the like. The wick may be made from any porous material wherein said porous material sufficiently malleable to permit the liquid conduit to be at least partially inserted therein.

The wick is preferably sized to extend from a base of reservoir to protrude through the plug or a reservoir seal to extend thereabove.

A further advantage of the present invention over typical devices used for emanating volatile liquids from a wicked replaceable refill such as a mains electrical plug in diffuser is that since heat is not used to drive the emanation of the volatile liquid there will be no unsightly discolouration of the wick.

The nozzle insert is preferably configured to extend from or adjacent the nozzle along the interior of the fluid conduit and may be provided at a rearward portion thereof that is remote from the nozzle with a channel. The channel may be inwardly tapered toward a forward portion thereof to in use further lower the pressure and increase the speed of air pumped therethrough forward of the inward taper may be provided a ejector constriction portion. Forward from said ejector constriction portion may be provided an expansion chamber. The liquid conduit engaging member preferably connects to the fluid conduit in the ejector constriction portion to be in fluid communication with the fluid conduit and or the nozzle insert such that in use the decrease in pressure at the connection draws liquid up the liquid conduit n the refill into the liquid conduit engaging member and into the fluid conduit and or nozzle insert before being carried by the pumped air flow out of the nozzle or nozzle insert into the environment surrounding the device.

Alternatively the ejector constriction can be formed integrally with the fluid conduit adjacent the nozzle. As a further alternative the ejector constriction can be formed integrally with the nozzle.

The nozzle or nozzle insert may be provided with one or more break up bars and or swirl chambers in order to improve the mechanical break up of the volatile liquid being sprayed therefrom in use.

The device is preferably provided with a controller that is configured to control the air pump to control the spraying of volatile liquid from the device. Preferably the controller is provided with a timer to permit the controller to instruct the pump to operate for periods defined by the controller. The device may be provided with user input means to allow a user to instruct the controller how long to spray for and or how often to spray for and or the spray rate of the device.

The device may be provided with a sensor means which is connected to the controller wherein said sensor means is configured to detect a characteristic in the environment surrounding the device. The controller would preferably be operative to analyse an input from the sensor means and control the air pump to spray a determined amount of volatile liquid.

Preferably the sensor means is provided by at least one motion sensor means and or at least one odour sensor means.

The motion sensor means may be provided in the form of at least one of an infrared IR sensor a laser sensor and a sound sensor.

The laser sensor may be operable to emit one or more laser beams and be adapted to detect when an object breaks the one or more beams by moving across the beam s thus indicating the presence of a person or an animal within the vicinity of the device. The sound sensor may be operable to detect sound within the vicinity of the device and preferably once the detected sound exceeds a predefined level this is indicative of movement within the vicinity of the device.

The odour sensor means may be provided by a MOS sensor or the like and may be operable to detect common household odours and the chemicals which constitute these malodours. For example kitchen malodour bathroom malodour tobacco smoke pet odours mould and or mildew body odour fish onions garbage fragrance from other products such as detergents polishes cleaning products etc . To facilitate such detection the odour sensor means may be operable to detect at least some of the following chemical components amines and nitrogen compounds acids and or sulphur compounds such as mercaptans thioacids thioesters sulfides phenols and skatole.

The device of any of the above mentioned aspects may be provided with an indicator wherein said indicator is operable to indicate to a user what function the device is currently performing. The indicator may be operable to provide a visual indication and or provide an audible indication.

Preferably the indicator is configured to provide a visual indication by emitting light from one or more light sources preferably one or more LEDs.

The one or more light sources may be adapted to emit a different colour of light to indicate the current function the device is performing. Additionally or alternatively the one or more light sources may blink or flash to indicate the current function the device is performing.

Alternatively or additionally the device may be operable to visually indicate the function currently being performed by the device via a screen. The screen may be an LCD screen that is adapted to provide a message to a user for instance such messages could include ON DISPENSING RESTING NORMAL MODE DETECTING MODE BOOST MODE OFF .

The device may be power by mains supplied electricity and or be battery powered and or be powered by solar cells located on the device. Most preferably the device is battery powered however to improve the portability thereof. Indeed battery powered is preferred as the use of such power is consider to be particularly advantageous over typical devices used for emanating volatile liquids from a wicked replaceable refill such as a mains electrical plug in diffuser is that the device does not need to be located adjacent an electrical plug socket nor within an acceptable distance of the socket such that there can be a electrical power cord between the device and plug socket thus providing true portability.

Any of the features described herein may be combined with any of the above aspects in any combination.

The air pump is shown in fluid communication with a fluid conduit such that air pumped by the pump is pumped into the fluid conduit . The pumped air passes along the fluid conduit through a nozzle insert discussed in greater detail below and out of a nozzle not shown . Connected to the fluid conduit around the nozzle insert is a liquid conduit engaging member .

The liquid conduit engaging member is made from a rigid or substantially rigid material such as a metal alloy or plastics material and is of a generally tubular construction to permit volatile liquid to be transported therein and having a generally tapered end to permit engagement with a hollow liquid conduit .

The refill comprises a reservoir that is partially or completely transparent thus allowing a user to monitor the volatile liquid level therein. The reservoir is sealed with a seal having an aperture therethrough and the aperture is sized to correspond to the diameter or cross section of the wick to securely hold it in a fixed position whilst substantially maintaining a liquid seal to substantially or completely prevent the leaking of liquid from the reservoir.

Although not shown in detail in the nozzle insert is configured to be held in place by the nozzle and extend therefrom along the interior of the fluid conduit .

Forward of the inward taper may be provided a ejector constriction portion and forward from said ejector constriction portion may be provided an expansion chamber. The liquid conduit connects to the fluid conduit in the ejector constriction portion to be in fluid communication with the fluid conduit and or the nozzle insert such that in use the decrease in pressure at the connection draws liquid up the liquid conduit into the liquid conduit engaging member and further into the fluid conduit and or nozzle insert before being carried by the pumped air flow out of the nozzle into the environment surrounding the device .

Turning to the device is provided with a housing which compartmentalises the components of the device the batteries are located within a base of the housing . Above the batteries is located the air pump and the fluid conduit is connected thereto. A nozzle insert and nozzle A are also shown. A securing means is provided in the form of a platform on which the refill sits and also in the form of a neck gripping means which is arranged to grip an upper portion of the refill .

The mechanism is provided in the form of guide means which permit an upper part of the housing to move away from the platform in a generally upward direction defined by the guide means to permit the refill to be placed on the platform . Once the refill is on the platform the upper part of the housing can be moved generally downwardly as defined by the guide means to allow the liquid conduit engagement member to penetrate the hollow liquid conduit in the wick of the refill. The neck gripping means impinge on an upper portion of the refill to prevent further ingress of the liquid conduit engagement member into the liquid conduit to prevent damage from forcible insertion.
