The present application is a continuation of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 630 555 filed on Dec. 14 2011 which is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. 61 629 318 filed on Nov. 16 2011 the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to the field of portable devices and more particularly to portable devices comprising a biometric sensor arrangement for measuring one or more intrinsic physical or health characteristic of a human.

The autonomic nervous system ANS regulates involuntary organs while the contraction of voluntary skeletal muscles is controlled by somatic motor nerves. Examples of involuntary organs include respiratory and digestive organs and also include blood vessels and the heart. Often the ANS functions in an involuntary reflexive manner to regulate glands to regulate muscles in the skin eye stomach intestines and bladder and to regulate cardiac muscle and the muscle around blood vessels for example.

The ANS includes the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is affiliated with stress and the fight or flight response to emergencies. Among other effects the fight or flight response increases blood pressure and heart rate to increase skeletal muscle blood flow and decreases digestion to provide the energy for fighting or fleeing. The parasympathetic nervous system is affiliated with relaxation and the rest and digest response which among other effects decreases blood pressure and heart rate and increases digestion to conserve energy. The ANS maintains normal internal function and works with the somatic nervous system. Afferent nerves convey impulses toward a nerve center and efferent nerves convey impulses away from a nerve center.

The heart rate and force is increased when the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated and is decreased when the sympathetic nervous system is inhibited the parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated . Cardiac rate contractility and excitability are known to be modulated by centrally mediated reflex pathways. Baroreceptors and chemoreceptors in the heart great vessels and lungs transmit cardiac activity through vagal and sympathetic afferent fibers to the central nervous system. Activation of sympathetic afferents triggers reflex sympathetic activation parasympathetic inhibition vasoconstriction and tachycardia. In contrast parasympathetic activation results in bradycardia vasodilation and inhibition of vasopressin release. Among many other factors decreased parasympathetic or vagal tone or increased sympathetic tone is associated with various arrhythmias genesis including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.

Stimulating the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems can have effects other than heart rate and blood pressure. For example stimulating the sympathetic nervous system dilates the pupil reduces saliva and mucus production relaxes the bronchial muscle reduces the successive waves of involuntary contraction peristalsis of the stomach and the motility of the stomach increases the conversion of glycogen to glucose by the liver decreases urine secretion by the kidneys and relaxes the wall and closes the sphincter of the bladder. Stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system constricts the pupil increases saliva and mucus production contracts the bronchial muscle increases secretions and motility in the stomach and large intestine and increases digestion in the small intention increases urine secretion and contracts the wall and relaxes the sphincter of the bladder. The functions associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are many and can be complexly integrated with each other.

Neural stimulation can be used to stimulate nerve traffic or inhibit nerve traffic. An example of neural stimulation to stimulate nerve traffic is a lower frequency signal e.g. within a range on the order of 20 Hz to 50 Hz . An example of neural stimulation to inhibit nerve traffic is a higher frequency signal e.g. within a range on the order of 120 Hz to 150 Hz . Other methods for stimulating and inhibiting nerve traffic have been proposed. According to various embodiments of the present subject matter sympathetic neural targets include but are not limited to a peroneal nerve a sympathetic column in a spinal cord and cardiac post ganglionic sympathetic neurons. According to various embodiments of the present subject matter parasympathetic neural targets include but are not limited to a vagus nerve a baroreceptor and a cardiac fat pad. Neural stimulation can be selectively delivered to afferent neural pathways selectively delivered to efferent neural pathways or delivered to both afferent and efferent neural pathways. For example some embodiments selectively stimulate or inhibit only parasympathetic afferents or only parasympathetic efferents and some embodiments selectively stimulate or inhibit sympathetic afferents or efferents.

The present subject matter can be used to prophylactically or therapeutically treat various diseases by modulating autonomic tone. Examples of such diseases or conditions include hypertension cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

Hypertension is a cause of heart disease and other related cardiac co morbidities. Hypertension occurs when blood vessels constrict. As a result the heart works harder to maintain flow at a higher blood pressure which can contribute to heart failure. Hypertension generally relates to high blood pressure such as a transitory or sustained elevation of systemic arterial blood pressure to a level that is likely to induce cardiovascular damage or other adverse consequences. Hypertension has been defined as a systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg. Consequences of uncontrolled hypertension include but are not limited to retinal vascular disease and stroke left ventricular hypertrophy and failure myocardial infarction dissecting aneurysm and renovascular disease. A large segment of the general population as well as a large segment of patients implanted with pacemakers or defibrillators suffer from hypertension. The long term mortality as well as the quality of life can be improved for this population if blood pressure and hypertension can be reduced. Many patients who suffer from hypertension do not respond to treatment such as treatments related to lifestyle changes and hypertension drugs.

Following myocardial infarction MI or other cause of decreased cardiac output a complex remodeling process of the ventricles occurs that involves structural biochemical neurohormonal and electrophysiologic factors. Ventricular remodeling is triggered by a physiological compensatory mechanism that acts to increase cardiac output due to so called backward failure which increases the diastolic filling pressure of the ventricles and thereby increases the so called preload i.e. the degree to which the ventricles are stretched by the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole . An increase in preload causes an increase in stroke volume during systole a phenomena known as the FrankStarling principle. When the ventricles are stretched due to the increased preload over a period of time however the ventricles become dilated. The enlargement of the ventricular volume causes increased ventricular wall stress at a given systolic pressure. Along with the increased pressure volume work done by the ventricle this acts as a stimulus for hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium. The disadvantage of dilatation is the extra workload imposed on normal residual myocardium and the increase in wall tension Laplace s Law which represent the stimulus for hypertrophy. If hypertrophy is not adequate to match increased tension a vicious cycle ensues which causes further and progressive dilatation. As the heart begins to dilate afferent baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor signals are sent to the vasomotor central nervous system control center which responds with hormonal secretion and sympathetic discharge. It is the combination of hemodynamic sympathetic nervous system and hormonal alterations such as presence or absence of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE activity that ultimately account for the deleterious alterations in cell structure involved in ventricular remodeling. The sustained stresses causing hypertrophy induce apoptosis i.e. programmed cell death of cardiac muscle cells and eventual wall thinning which causes further deterioration in cardiac function. Thus although ventricular dilation and hypertrophy may at first be compensatory and increase cardiac output the processes ultimately result in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction decompensation . It has been shown that the extent of ventricular remodeling is positively correlated with increased mortality in post MI and heart failure patients.

Heart failure refers to a clinical syndrome in which cardiac function causes a below normal cardiac output that can fall below a level adequate to meet the metabolic demand of peripheral tissues. Heart failure may present itself as congestive heart failure CHF due to the accompanying venous and pulmonary congestion. Heart failure can be due to a variety of etiologies such as ischemic heart disease. Heart failure patients have reduced autonomic balance which is associated with LV dysfunction and increased mortality. Modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems has potential clinical benefit in preventing remodeling and death in heart failure and post MI patients. Direct electrical stimulation can activate the baroreflex inducing a reduction of sympathetic nerve activity and reducing blood pressure by decreasing vascular resistance. Sympathetic inhibition and parasympathetic activation have been associated with reduced arrhythmia vulnerability following a myocardial infarction presumably by increasing collateral perfusion of the acutely ischemic myocardium and decreasing myocardial damage.

The prior art teaches many way of measuring heart rate. A stethoscope is traditionally used to amplify these sounds and present them to a caregiver. The acoustic principle may also be used in other ways both manual and automated at various parts of the body. Another way is the pulse oximeter approach. In pulse oximeters a light of a known frequency through an area of the body such as the fingertip or earlobe and detect the same light once it has either passed through the body or been reflected back to a photo sensor. With each heart beat oxygen rich blood is momentarily pushed through the capillaries in that region. This momentary increase in the oxygen content of the blood upon each heart beat changes the optical properties of the blood. As the light passes through the fingertip or earlobe specific frequencies are absorbed to varying degrees depending on the amount of oxygen in the blood and are therefore not present in the returning light. The change in detected frequencies occurring once per heart beat allows for detection of individual heart beats and thus a heart rate measurement. The degree of spectral change is used to determine the oxygen content in the blood. Another measurement method makes use of the varying outward pressure applied against the skin by major arteries. With each heart beat a surge of blood passes through the arteries. In an artery of sufficient size and located near to the surface of the body this momentary pressure can be detected by holding a pressure sensor such as a piezo electric P E element in place over the artery location. The P E element is physically stretched by the momentary outward pressure of the artery during a heart beat. As it is stretched the altered shape of the P E element changes its electrical characteristics e.g. a change in its resistance to a current passing through it. Changes in the resistance of the P E are then detected by appropriate circuitry and used to identify heart beats and thus heart rate. Suitable surface arteries and sensing devices are well known in the art and include sensing at the wearer s wrist the temple the inner ear or the bridge of the nose.

Heart rate monitoring using the chest strap method has become increasingly popular for sports and fitness training as well as for some other activities such as relaxation training stress relief and meditation in which heart rate as a bio feedback item has been found useful. During this time the chest strap has remained in much the same form as a practical means of obtaining a continuous accurate heart rate reading for these largely non medical purposes. However for many users the chest strap may chafe causing discomfort. Many users find them awkward to put on uncomfortable to wear and bothersome to keep handy. In addition they can be restrictive of good chest expansion and thus restrict full breathing during exercise. For wearers with slender ribs and torsos the chest strap can slip down out of the proper position and cease to function properly. Stretched across the chest they are perceived by some as unmanly or unwomanly or as interfering with tan lines or undergarments.

There are various physiological factors affecting the autonomic regulation of heart rate respiration thermoregulation hormonal regulation blood pressure cardiac output etc. One of the most important factors is blood pressure. There are special cells in the heart and large blood vessels that sense blood pressure level and send afferent stimulation to the central structures of the ANS that control HR and blood vessel tonus forming a continuous feedback to maintain an optimal level of the blood pressure.

This mechanism is also called baroreflex. It increases HR when blood pressure drops and vice versa and thus maintains a short term stable blood supply to the vital organs.

One of the best ways to assess the autonomic function is to analyze minute changes in heart rate which are caused by many factors including regulatory influence of the autonomic nervous system.

A special method of analysis can be applied to recorded heart rate readings. It is called Heart Rate Variability HRV analysis. The HRV analysis is a powerful very accurate reliable reproducible yet simple to do.

It is found that lowered HRV is associated with aging decreased autonomic activity hormonal tonus specific types of autonomic neuropathies e.g. diabetic neuropathy and increased risk of sudden cardiac death after acute heart attack.

Other research indicated that depression panic disorders and anxiety have negative impact on autonomic function typically causing depletion of the parasympathetic tonus. On the other hand an increased sympathetic tonus is associated with lowered threshold of ventricular fibrillation. These two factors could explain why such autonomic imbalance caused by significant mental and emotional stress increases risk of heart attack followed by sudden cardiac death.

Aside from that there are multiple studies indicating that HRV is quite useful as a way to quantitatively measure physiological changes caused by various interventions both pharmacological and non pharmacological during treatment of many pathological conditions having significant manifestation of lowered HRV.

However it is important to realize that clinical implication of HRV analysis has been clearly recognized as a predictor of risk of arrhythmic events or sudden cardiac death after acute heart attack and as clinical marker of diabetic neuropathy evolution.

Nevertheless as the number of clinical studies involving HRV in various clinical aspects and conditions grows HRV remains one of the most promising methods of investigating general health in the future.

There is an ongoing need for an improved system and method for heart rate heart rate variability wellness and fitness monitoring that is user friendly and less invasive.

Holding the cover in one hand e.g. the left hand the patient makes contact with one electrode one on one side of the cover which contacts the thumb. The patient then touches the other side of the cover with the other hand making contact with the other electrode to the other side. ECG and heart rate are thereby recorded for 1 to 5 minutes.

According to one aspect shown in the invention can be realized as a specially designed headphone and left extremity strap . The invention encompasses at least two electrodes on the inner or outer right ear hereafter referred to as ear and another on the left extremity. The electrodes are made out of stainless steel silicon nitride or silver silver chloride with dimensions between approximately 3 mm to 10 mm in diameter or in width length. The two electrodes in and positive and negative are paired with a third electrode to serve as a reference voltage ground for the differential amplifier and to improve common mode noise rejection. The preferred system features a negative electrode on the right ear and a positive or ground electrode on a strap touching the skin on the lower arm.

In another embodiment the system has two electrodes at least one electrode positioned to be in contact with the skin of the head including the ear via a headphone or headset and a second electrode positioned to be in contact either with the skin of the arm at the bicep or wrist or else with the skin of the torso at the waist.

HRV is being used to derive health assessment metrics such as overall health and wellness aging fitness and stress . The source information for HRV analysis is continuous beat by beat not averaged recording of heartbeat intervals. The electrical footprint of the heart or Electrocardiograph ECG or EKG is considered as the best way to measure heartbeat intervals. ECG is an electrical signal reflecting minute changes in the electrical field generated by heart muscle cells. It is measured by a special electronic device with conductive electrodes placed on chest around heart area or limbs. ECG signal has a very specific and robust waveform simple to detect and analyze. Cardiac rhythm sequence of heartbeat intervals derived from ECG is the best way to detect normal heartbeats as well as all sorts of ectopic heartbeats which must be excluded from the HRV analysis.

The autonomic nervous system function can be evaluated with the Autonomic Balance Test. This test is based on the short term HRV analysis of resting heart rate recordings of 1 to 5 minutes long. Such recordings are assumed to be done at a steady state physiological condition and should be properly standardized to produce comparable results.

According to the standards set forth by the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in 1996 there are two methods of analysis of HRV data time and frequency domain analysis. For both methods the heartbeat intervals should be properly calculated and any abnormal heartbeats found. HRV relates to the regulation of the sinoatrial node the natural pacemaker of the heart by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. An HRV assessment is based on the assumption that the beat to beat fluctuations in the rhythm of the heart provide us with an indirect measure of heart health as defined by the degree of balance in sympathetic and vagus nerve activity.

The ECG recorder collects ECG data from users which gets analyzed and converted to HRV data the gives information about different states of the Autonomic Nervous System. It happens that ANS states vary from one individual to another especially of different age and gender. The backend server matches the state of the user s Autonomic Nervous System to the range of healthy states of individuals of within the age range and gender. The correct results about your health and fitness are determined.

Fitness assessment is based on the one of the most accurate methods of fitness assessment. Analysis is done on ECG signal at the backend server that determines the autonomic nervous system s response on a simple standup maneuver. The standup maneuver causes heart rate to rise within the first 10 15 seconds because blood pressure drops due to gravitational redistribution of the blood mass. Then the cardiovascular system attempts to compensate an orthostatic effect of standing up by constricting peripheral blood vessels. As a result blood pressure returns to its normal level and heart rate drops. Athlete body reaction is fast and strong while sedentary lifestyle makes body react with a delay and a little amplitude. This serves as a base of determining a fitness level.

This biological clock is determined based on the body s ANS autonomic nervous system response on paced breathing. The risk of myocardial infarction and overall health condition of the body is evaluated.

The current invention makes an assessment of the autonomic nervous system regulatory function condition based Autonomic Balance a ratio between levels of the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and Autonomic Tonus a net level of the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.

There are three main types of the autonomic nervous system conditions 1 Predominant parasympathetic nervous system function typical for a state of relaxation 2 Predominant sympathetic nervous system function typical for a state of stress and 3 Balanced autonomic nervous system function typical for an idle calm state.

Each of these three categories may have three different levels of the autonomic tonus low normal or high. The Autonomic Balance is calculated in points based on 80 of least deviated values of HRV parameters in the normative database. It ranges from 10 points to 10 points.

To make a conclusion on the HRV analysis actual ECG readings of all HRV parameters are compared with their respective normal ranges specific to patient s age and gender. These normal ranges are taken from a normative database built in a special clinical study on a large pool of clinically validated healthy subjects.

Normal range is a range of values of certain HRV parameter representing statistical distribution of this parameter values in a large population of healthy individuals of selected age and gender. For instance the logarithmic value of HF ms 2 Hz lies in range between 2.5 and 6.6 for males between 30 and 40 years old.

In this embodiment a 48 years old male was tested with an autonomic balance test. The test results showed an HF parameter value of 3.1 on logarithmic scale of ms 2 Hz. A predicted value for 48 years old males is 4.03. One of the widely used approaches is determining a normal range based on criteria of statistical distribution of measured parameter values in healthy subjects. Typically normal range is considered within 95 of the interval of confidence in both directions. This range would fit 95 of all readings obtained from healthy subjects of the selected population. It is important to mention that there is a borderline zone or conditional norm in near proximity to the borders of the normal range. Actual readings falling into this zone have higher risk to be abnormal ones.

All test results of the healthy subjects tested in a special epidemiologic study were analyzed by separate gender and age groups. For example all test results of all males of age 30 were put in one group. Predicted values for each HRV parameter were calculated as described above. Then all parameter values in this example mean heart rate were grouped around the predicted values. 5 of the values most deviating from the predicted value are considered as outlying outside of the normal range . The rest 95 of all values define the normal range.

The ECG recorder considers 15 of the most deviating values among those falling into 95 range as borderline range. Only remaining 80 of all values forms a true normal range used to form an interpretive Autonomic Balance diagram described below. For the subject described in this example a lower borderline level of HF parameter is 2.64. Thus the value shown in the example above falls into a borderline zone.

When using the ECG recorder in to monitor the dynamics of changes in the autonomic regulatory function or to evaluate the effects of specific factors on this function an important question is usually asked if the changes in a measured parameter are considered significant or are result of normal variation of the random process. This question is answered based on assessment of the reproducibility and repeatability of the measured parameter. Reproducibility is a variance of a parameter being repeatedly measured in the same subject within a limited time frame. Repeatability reflects natural variance of a specific parameter in the same subject observed during a long period of time several weeks .

HRV parameters significantly depend on current condition of the subject at a time of testing. Thus it is virtually impossible to obtain absolutely identical readings measured at different moments. This means that the reproducibility and repeatability of the test cannot be 100 . High level of reproducibility and repeatability means only qualitative similarity of any two test results obtained from the same individual at substantially similar conditions of both subject and testing environment. When comparing test results keep in mind that the autonomic nervous system is fairly sensitive to many internal and external factors including various genetically predetermined and transitory factors health assessment metrics.

The most appropriate way to assess the autonomic nervous system function is to use so called predicted values defining normal values of specific HRV parameters which we expect to obtain from a tested individual if we assume that this individual is healthy. Predicted value is a statistically most probable value of the parameter predicted based on correlation between this parameter values age and gender of healthy individuals. Predicted values are calculated by the formulae created based on a special study obtained readings from a large population of healthy subjects of different ages and gender.

It s well established that baroreceptor strength declines with age. The reason is that the sensitiveness of the body to any external or internal stimulant makes body easily adaptable to new environment and tells about its strong immunity to fight diseases.

An optimal level of the systemic arterial blood pressure is one of the vital physiological parameters determining adequate function of the cardiovascular system. If arterial pressure is too low then brain heart and other vital organ do not receive an adequate blood supply so their functions may be affected e.g. low blood supply to the brain would cause dizziness or even fainting. Alternatively too high arterial pressure causes unnecessary workload to the heart and negatively affects vascular system.

An arterial baroreflex is a key mechanism of short term regulation of arterial blood pressure. Its whole purpose is to sense minute changes in blood pressure and adjust heart rate to compensate changes in blood supply to the vital organ caused by blood pressure changes. Baroreflex function significantly affects body s ability to adequately react to physical emotional or mental stressors which may cause significant changes in blood pressure. Decreased baroreflex function may be an early sign of developing cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension and poor overall health .

The biological clock test involves continued deep breathing following on screen instructions for about 1 minute. During that time the ECG recorder analyzes reaction of the user s body on deep paced breathing. The more sensitive the body is the better shape the user is in. This means that the body is capable to react immediately on changes in internal and external environments which is a good sign of being younger.

During inhalation the chest is expanding and its internal pressure drops leading to a slight drop in blood pressure because large blood vessels inside the chest are stretched when chest is expanded. The baroreflex causes a quick increase in heart rate as described above. During exhalation the chest contracts so its internal pressure rises causing blood pressure to rise as well due to shrinking large blood vessels in the chest. The baroreflex causes a quick decrease in heart rate as described above. This phenomenon is also known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Deep breathing causes maximum possible fluctuations in blood pressure which helps measuring baroreflex function with larger stimuli. It was found that the highest changes in heart rate induced by deep breathing happen when breathing at the rate of about 6 breaths per minute. Measurement of heart rate oscillations when breathing deeply at 6 breaths per minute is a simple yet effective way to measure baroreflex function. The less sensitive baroreflex is the lesser heart rate oscillations occur.

High baroreflex function is a sign of good vascular elasticity and thus ability of the body to efficiently adapt to various physical emotional and metal factors causing stress and raise of blood pressure. Low baroreflex function typically is a sign of aging process or certain cardiovascular problem causing stiffness or arterial walls.

The time interval between intrinsic ventricular heart contractions changes in response to the body s metabolic need for a change in heart rate and the amount of blood pumped through the circulatory system. For example during a period of exercise or other activity a person s intrinsic heart rate will generally increase over a time period of several or many heartbeats. However even on a beat to beat basis that is from one heart beat to the next and without exercise the time interval between intrinsic heart contractions varies in a normal person. These beat to beat variations in intrinsic heart rate are the result of proper regulation by the autonomic nervous system of blood pressure and cardiac output the absence of such variations indicates a possible deficiency in the regulation being provided by the autonomic nervous system. One method for analyzing HRV involves detecting intrinsic ventricular contractions and recording the time intervals between these contractions referred to as the R R intervals after filtering out any ectopic contractions ventricular contractions that are not the result of a normal sinus rhythm . This signal of R R intervals is typically transformed into the frequency domain such as by using fast Fourier transform so that its spectral frequency components can be analyzed and divided into low and high frequency bands. For example the low frequency LF band can correspond to a frequency LF range 0.04 Hz to 

In another embodiment the WM may be performed by time domain measurements of the ECG signal. In a continuous ECG record each QRS complex is detected and the so called normal to normal NN intervals that is all intervals between adjacent QRS complexes resulting from sinus node depolarizations or the instantaneous heart rate is determined. The simplest variable to calculate is the standard deviation of the NN intervals SDNN that is the square root of variance. Since variance is mathematically equal to total power of spectral analysis SDNN reflects all the cyclic components responsible for variability in the period of recording. The HRV measurement will be used along with at least one parameter such as body weight to provide a more complete picture of health.

There needs to be a balance between hard and easy training and rest both within a single training week and within longer training periods. When a hard training session or training period that causes a significant disturbance in body s homeostasis is followed by sufficient recovery performance improvements are likely to occur. The importance of sufficient recovery is due to the fact that performance improvements actually occur during recovery from training not during workouts. Finding a balance between training load and recovery is a key factor in improving athletic performance.

Recovery is an important factor with any training regimen. Usually athletes have several very hard training periods each year during which both the intensity and volume of training are very high. These kind of overreaching periods are very exhaustive but necessary for elite athletes to further improve their performance. However performance can improve only if hard training is followed by adequate recovery.

Too hard training without sufficient rest may lead to overtraining which is characterized by decreased performance and in the worst case also other harmful effects on health. Recovery from overtraining may take from several weeks to months but it is also possible that an athlete never reaches the same level of performance as before overtraining. Prevention of overtraining is therefore crucial and is possible by systematic assessment of the athlete s recovery. Recovery is defined as decreased activation in the body during relaxation rest and or peaceful working related to lack of external and internal stress factors when parasympathetic vagal activity is great and sympathetic activity is low. Recovery is detected when HR is close to the resting level and HRV is great and regular according to the breathing rhythm. Level of HRV is individual. This must be taken into account when interpreting the measured data since analysis is based on HRV. It is recommended that reference values are measured for both high training load poor recovery and for low training load well recovered conditions. These reference values should be updated whenever needed for example between different training periods if changes appear in ANS function.

Respiration can be an indicator of activity and can provide an explanation of increased sympathetic tone. For example it may not be appropriate to change or modify a treatment for modulating autonomic tone due to a detected increase in sympathetic activity attributable to exercise. Respiration measurements can be used to measure Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia RSA . RSA is the natural cycle of arrhythmia that occurs through the influence of breathing on the flow of sympathetic and vagus impulses to the sinoatrial node parasympathetic nervous system PNS . The rhythm of the heart is primarily under the control of the vagus nerve which inhibits heart rate and the force of contraction. The vagus nerve activity is impeded and heart rate begins to increase when a breath is inhaled. When exhaled vagus nerve activity increases and the heart rate begins to decrease. The degree of fluctuation in heart rate is also controlled significantly by regular impulses from the baroreceptors pressure sensors in the aorta and carotid arteries. Thus a measurement of autonomic balance can be provided by correlating heart rate to the respiration cycle. The bigger the RSA the better it is for heart function and blood pressure. Short and rapid breathing is associated with small RSA and slow and long breath with larger RSA. Thus slow and long breath is helpful in supporting heart function and lowering blood pressure.
