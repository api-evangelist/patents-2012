The present application is a continuation application claiming priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 to utility application Ser. No. 11 929 336 titled Improved Functionalities for Local Number Portability in a Telecommunications Network filed on Oct. 30 2007 which claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 855 485 filed 31 Oct. 2006 entitled VOIP Enhanced Local Service Active Day of Port Trigger and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 941 102 filed 31 May 2007 entitled Local Number Portability LNP Processes. All of the aforementioned patent applications are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

Local Number Portability LNP was defined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain at the same location existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality reliability or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another . In other words LNP is the process by which customers request a change in underlying voice service from one telecommunications carrier to another.

LNP supports many porting options including porting a wire line telephone number TN from one carrier to another carrier referred to herein as a core telecommunications carrier known as Port In porting a wire line telephone number from the core telecommunications carrier to another carrier known as Port Out and porting wire line telephone numbers between customers of the core telecommunications carrier who are both using the network of the core telecommunications carrier known as Internal Port or Migration .

The Federal Communications Commission FCC has required that all local exchange carriers LEC in the 100 largest metropolitan markets provide LNP no later than the end of 1998. The LNP rules that the FCC has put in place support competitive market theory by removing the personal inconvenience of having to obtain a new phone number when an end user moves to a new preferred service provider. Carriers must honor a porting request that is supported by an end user s authorization.

LNP received little attention until the FCC issued the mandate requiring the implementation of LNP according to a very aggressive schedule. The solution that was chosen by the FCC to provide LNP was the Local Routing Number LRN method. The LRN method includes providing in addition to the original telephone number a new 10 digit number the LRN along with the identification of the CLEC to which the service has been ported when performing LNP. When the originating central office switch consults the Service Control Point SCP database to route an LNP number the original telephone number and the LRN are utilized to identify the CLEC associated with the telephone number. The originating carrier then hands off the call to the CLEC. While this approach is claimed to be faster clearly two telephone numbers are required thereby placing additional pressure on the North American Numbering Plan NANP .

With the emergence of LNP as a required service of telecommunications providers customers of the telecommunications providers may present specific needs and services as part of the LNP process that may be addressed by processes that would be beneficial to the customer. For instance special business models that involve LNP activities outside of the core telecommunications carrier may exist. The ability to provide a functionality that allows customers who want to port their own TNs to a telecommunications carrier using non standard procedures such as providing the capability to perform LNP themselves or by means of a third party may be beneficial.

In addition customers may desire additional testing techniques to improve the LNP process. For example the ability to test whether there are any errors in an LNP order request prior to actually submitting the order would be beneficial. Also a test to determine whether a TN has already been ported in ported out or migrated from the telecommunications carrier would also be beneficial.

Another problem associated with the current LNP process is that currently customers have no control over the timing during which ports occur on the Firm Order Commitment FOC date for their LNP order s . Presently ports for LNP are automatically triggered by the core telecommunications carrier within a pre determined product specific window. It would be beneficial to enable customers with the ability to trigger the activation sequence of the porting process for the TNs associated with their own orders.

Currently none of the above improved functionalities to LNP exist. A telecommunications carrier would be able to provide better products and customer service if there were capable of providing such functionalities.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to improved functionalities for local number portability in a telecommunications network.

Embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for improved functionalities for LNP processes. For example embodiments of the invention provide for a local service request LSR bypass option a real time RT customer service request CSR option a port check tool PCT and a port triggering capability. Embodiments of the invention may also include further processes associated with improved functionalities for LNP.

A standard LNP business model of a core telecommunications carrier provides customers of the core telecommunications carrier who want to port one or more of their telephone numbers TNs to the core telecommunications carrier with the ability to submit orders to the core telecommunications carrier. With respect to its received LNP order the core telecommunications may then manage all local exchange carrier LEC facing activities the core telecommunications carrier TN provisioning activities and Number Portability Administration Center NPAC activation activities. As referred to herein a customer of a core telecommunications carrier may refer to another telecommunications carrier that provides telecommunications services to an end user person. In some embodiments such a customer may include a LEC competitive LEC CLEC incumbent LEC ILEC or any other type of telecommunications carrier. In addition a core telecommunications carrier may include the above types of telecommunications carriers but is not limited to such an embodiment.

Continuing with the standard LNP process of the core telecommunications carrier manages TN provisioning and any associated fall out . In addition the core telecommunications carrier manages activation related NPAC activities and any associated fall out . Customers may trigger the port manually or the core telecommunications carrier may trigger the port automatically . The core telecommunications carrier automatically submits the activation request to the NPAC .

In one embodiment the customer is responsible to ensure to the core telecommunications carrier that a TN and an associated subscriber address is actually available within a timeframe requested. The customer is also responsible to resolve any fall out identified as result of the service availability checks. It should be noted that the customer s responsibilities in general for the pre submit process for LNP vary greatly between a standard LNP business model such as that described in and the LSR bypass business model for LNP which is described in more detail below .

As illustrated in the pre submit process for an LNP order begins with the customer checking service availability with the core telecommunications carrier for the LNP order. Then the customer resolves any pre order submit fallout . In some embodiments the customer or the customer in association with a third party may be fully responsible for the following activities when utilizing the LSR bypass option described further below . However responsibility may fall on both the customer and core telecommunications carrier when utilizing a standard LNP option. Such activities may include those related to submitting CSR requests to the losing LEC and resolving associated CSR fall out submitting LSR requests to the losing LEC and resolving associated LSR fall out obtaining a FOC from the losing LEC and ensuring that obtained the FOC date meets the core telecommunications carrier s minimum Customer Requested Date CRD interval and providing and submitting for DL services .

In some embodiments the core telecommunications carrier may provide the customer with a pre order submit process such as for process of which serves both LNP Options standard and LSR bypass . Table 1 below shows one embodiment of exemplary business rules associated with service availability and calls out the process variations associated with the pre order submit process described with respect to . Note that the number in brackets under the Task column corresponds to the reference numerals of . Also note that references to CTC refer to the core telecommunications carrier. It should be realized that the following business rules are intended to be exemplary and not limiting in any way.

In one embodiment the core telecommunications carrier may manage the specialized LSR bypass process as illustrated in . The process of contains many steps that are similar to the standard LNP process illustrated in and much of the description of applies to . However there are some key differences of the LSR bypass process of in comparison to the standard LNP process of .

One difference is that the customer should use a B2B application programming interface API order entry mechanism to submit LSR bypass LNP orders to the core telecommunications carrier. Another difference is that the customer should manage any CSR LSR FOC and DL activities and their associated fall out as part of the LSR bypass LNP process. In some embodiments if the customer chooses not to perform DL activities himself the core telecommunications carrier may only offer DL change capabilities once the LSR bypass LNP order is completed. A further difference is that the core telecommunications carrier manages CNAM and NPAC activities and associated fall out except for Port In Conflict .

With respect to embodiments of the LSR bypass functionality for LNP the processes depicted in are now described in further detail. Note that the numbers in brackets correspond to the reference numerals of .

In some embodiments a core telecommunications carrier may define LNP service availability for a TN. This definition may provide that the TN should be portable to the core telecommunications carrier Operating Company Number OCN . Service availability may also include that a TN must be capable of provisioning on the core telecommunications carrier network that has to cover the rate center for that TN. In some cases certain E911 requirements should be met unless the customer chooses to provide 911 services himself or through a third party vendor. Finally service availability may include that an immediate subsequent LNP order submit request for the TN validated positively be submitted with the earliest CRD specified in the service availability results.

In some embodiments the service availability results obtained by the customer from the core telecommunications carrier system may include at least the following fields Portability Indicator Y N OCN Old OCN from losing carrier LRN Current LRN Rate Center Bulk Load B2B API only service availability indicator Y N Earliest CRD Latest CRD LATA Rate Center State New OCN New LRN Ebonded Flag Y N and Internal Port Indicator Y N . These fields may assist later in putting together the LNP order submit request.

Pre Order Submit fall out occurs when service availability validation for a specific TN fails. In those instances the core telecommunications carrier returns the service availability results with an error code and description to indicate to the customer why the TN cannot be served by the core telecommunications carrier. In some embodiments the core telecommunications carrier provides an error code list to all customers. The following Table 2 provides an exemplary list of error codes that the customer may receive from the core telecommunications carrier.

The following description described CSR Requests that are considered to be part of the Pre Order Submit process for the LSR bypass for LNP only. In addition embodiments of the invention provide for a CSR Request option for the standard LNP option. With regard to CSR Request for LSR bypass prior to submitting a porting request a Customer Service Record CSR is pulled from the losing LEC carrier to determine if the CSR is flagged by the carrier to indicate account details or line features which may potentially affect a subsequent port request. Examples of features that may affect a subsequent port request include but are not limited to Name Mismatch Address Mismatch or PIC Freeze .

In one embodiment the CSR Request for LSR bypass is considered to be the sole responsibility of the customer. In this case the core telecommunications carrier should not assist with any CSR fall out the customer might experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR bypass LNP option.

In one embodiment the core telecommunications carrier may use the following name mismatch determination rules to parse the CSR information as follows 

In another embodiment the core telecommunications carrier may also use the following address mismatch determination rules. If the address matches 3 out of 4 following conditions then the validation succeeds.

To port a TN to the core telecommunications carrier a Local Service Request LSR should be submitted to the losing LEC to obtain approval for the LNP process. In some embodiments this task is considered to be solely the customer s responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier in some cases might not assist with any LSR fall out the customer might experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR Bypass LNP Option.

Embodiments of the invention provide that the FOC date obtained from the LEC be used by the customer to submit a LNP order to the core telecommunications carrier while using the FOC as the CRD on that request. In some case this may be an important business rule for the LNP order submit process. In addition this task is considered to be solely the customer s responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier in some cases may not assist with any LSR fall out the customer may experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR bypass LNP option.

The customer is also responsible for resolving any fall out associate with CSR and or LSR fall out of the above processes. This resolution may include correcting any discrepancies in the CSR request or resolving any issues with the losing LEC that may be preventing the LNP process from occurring. The core telecommunications carrier in some cases might not assist with any LSR fall out the customer might experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR Bypass LNP Option.

This task is considered to be part of the Pre Order submit process for the LSR bypass for LNP process. In one embodiment the core telecommunications carrier does not provide DL services as part of a regular LSR bypass for LNP orders. Instead the customer may choose to provide DL services himself due to the customer s performance of the LSR activities with the LECs. In order to enable the customer to at least send the core telecommunications carrier this DL information an LSR bypass for LNP orders may still require the DL information to be populated yet with a DL request type of REMOVE for example. This allows the customer to make any adds moves and changes after the initial LNP order is successfully completed.

This task is considered to be solely the customer s responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier in some cases may not assist with any LSR fall out that the customer may experience due the core telecommunications carrier not owning the carrier relationship in the business models associated with LSR bypass for LNP.

RT CSR is a LNP functionality that may be utilized as part of the Pre Order submit process for the standard LNP Option. In one embodiment as part of a standard LNP order the core telecommunications carrier may request an advance CSR from the donor LEC for the TN being submitted for LNP. Then the core telecommunication carrier may perform a multitude of validations on the data returned to help bypass future problems as detailed below.

Typical CSR related order fall out remains a high bar for a majority of LNP customers. Often times a substantial amount of LNP orders for a given customer may be rejected by the core telecommunications carrier based on CSR data validations. Embodiments of RT CSR discussed here use an advance CSR request to preclude later rejections downstream in the actual LSR process associated with the donor LEC.

Embodiments of invention allow customers to utilize a simplified CSR request capability before an LNP order is submitted known as a RT CSR. As part of RT CSR CSR data will be returned in a near real time fashion and corrections to upcoming LNP orders may be made before submitting the actual order to the core telecommunications carrier. Utilizing the novel RT CSR request capability may dramatically reduce the LNP order fall out encountered resulting in standard porting Service Level Agreements SLAs being achieved on nearly all orders submitted and thereby providing an improved customer experience.

Embodiments of the RT CSR request capability are available through various entry options. These options include manual entry bulk entry and B2B API. In addition the RT CSR request capability may be utilized for TN s controlled by E Bonded Carriers LECs . E Bonded means the core telecommunications carrier has automated interfaces established with the donor LEC in question. In some embodiments the RT CSR request capability results may also be expected within a short time frame after the core telecommunications carrier has submitted the data to the donor LEC. However occasional RT CSR requests might return a CSR Not Available error.

Prior to executing a RT CSR request a Service Availability request should be executed for each TN to obtain a positive result. In the case of the Bulk Load and B2B API based service availability capability a customer should also obtain the E Bonded Y N results to identify if the OCN for that TN is considered E Bonded . Customers are responsible to validate the returned CSR data for warnings and or errors that indicate that an action must be taken by the customer before submitting the data as part of an LNP order. Customers may also be responsible to validate the returned CSR data for port inhibiting features on which action must be taken by the customer before submitting the data as part of an LNP order. In some cases the customer may have to request that the subscriber contact the donor LEC to remove those features.

Further details of embodiments of the RT CSR request process are now described with respect to which is a flow diagram depicting a process for RT CSR according to one embodiment of the invention. At processing block prior to executing the CSR Request the customer should validate positive TN service availability. In some embodiments the service availability capability by manual entry does not return any E Bonded information for a Carrier OCN returned. At this point the customer should continue with all TNs that are serviceable. For customers utilizing a bulk load or B2B API capability the customer should validate the successful service availability results for the E Bonded Y N information for the carrier OCN returned and continue only with those TNs listed as E Bonded Y . If the customer does continue with any TNs which are not considered E Bonded they may obtain an error on these TNs with the RT CSR results downstream.

Then at processing block utilizing the RT CSR request functionality the customer should enter each TN and its associated name and address data manually or via other formats for bulk load and B2B API and submit the entry. A RT CSR request ID is returned and should be recorded by the customer at processing block . At processing block if the customer has no intention to request RT CSR s for further TN s they should wait for the duration of a predetermined time window or else continue to submit other RT CSR requests at any time during this time window.

Next at processing block the customer may obtain CSR information by selecting an option to check results or by searching for the CSR Request by using the recorded CSR Request ID. In some cases the customer may obtain a message that the information will be available later or not at all. At this point the customer may view the results and check for potential fall out. For instance non Ebonded TNs will be tagged with an error code for the manual entry capability. Finally if the RT CSR data is completely clean the customer may proceed with an option to immediately continue to an order screen workflow without reentering the data.

In some embodiments of the invention the customer may have to handle RT CSR request fall out . The following common corrective action steps may be used to resolve fall out 

1. Identify if RT CSR data is returned SUCCESS or if no RT CSR data is returned ERROR . In some embodiments the following exemplary RT CSR request related error codes may be experienced as detailed in Table 3 

2. For successfully returned RT CSR data only the customer should validate if the record is tagged with a warning code. Some exemplary warning codes and their context are shown below in Table 4 

3. In the case where the TN submitted is of type Residential the customer will have to compare the RT CSR address with the submitted address utilizing the following rule set. Note that if the address matches 3 out of the 4 below criteria the validation may be called successful.

4. For successfully returned RT CSR data only the customer should check if the record is tagged with a CSR feature. In addition the customer should identify port prohibiting features as listed below and take corrective action by reviewing the feature with the subscriber and submitting an LNP order after the donor LEC has removed the feature to prevent future LNP order fall out. Port prohibiting features include but are not limited to 800 Number Foreign Exchange ISDN Local Service Provider LSP Freeze and Remote Call Forward. The following features are not port prohibitive but might affect the subscriber Centrex Contracted Custopak DSL Distinctive Ring and Hunting Feature.

Finally at processing block the customer should proceed with the LNP order request with any corrections to the order made based on the results of the RT CSR.

Some embodiments of the invention may additionally utilize a port check tool PCT . The PCT allows a core telecommunications carrier to determine 1 at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may provision a TN on its network port in 2 at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may remove the TN from its network port out and or 3 at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may migrate the TN from one customer on its network to another customer on its network migrate . In some embodiments the PCT may be deployed as software in the core telecommunications carrier s network.

In one embodiment the PCT is given a TN and may be told the specific port activity in or out although this is not necessary. The PCT then checks through a LNP call tester LCT on the core telecommunications carrier s network which references a subset of LERG data to determine a current LRN for the TN being tested. Utilizing this current LRN the PCT is able to determine whether a TN has been ported in ported out or migrated. depict the process flow by which the PCT determines porting status for the core telecommunications carrier.

Process is an exemplary method performed by a PCT of a core telecommunications carrier. Process begins at process block where a customer submits a TN for testing by the PCT. At processing block the TN is submitted to a LNP call tester LCT to determine the current LRN. Then at processing block the LCT returns the current LRN for the TN that was tested. In some embodiments this current LRN may be the same number as the TN.

Subsequently at decision block the PCT determines whether there is a target LRN for this TN. If so the PCT determines whether the target LRN equals the current LRN . If this scenario is true then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported via migration. However if the target LRN does not equal the current LRN at decision block then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest as the TN has not yet been ported.

Returning to decision block is there is not a current LRN for the TN then the process continues to decision block where it is determines whether the TN is being ported in. If the TN is operating under a Port In status then the process moves to decision block where it is determined whether the TN equals the current LRN. If the TN does equal the current LRN then at decision block it is determined whether the TN is in a block of TNs owned by the core telecommunications carrier. If so then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported via a port in process. If the TN is not owned by the core telecommunications carrier then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest as the TN has not yet been ported.

Returning to decision block if the TN does not equal the current LRN then the process continues to decision block where it is determined whether the current LRN is owned by the core telecommunications carrier. If so then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported via a port in process. If the LRN is not owned by the core telecommunications carrier then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest as the TN has not yet been ported.

Revisiting process block if is determined that the TN is not being ported in then the process defaults to the scenario where the TN is being ported out and continues to decision block . At decision block the PCT determines whether the TN equals the current LRN. If the TN does equal the current LRN then at decision block it is determined whether the TN is not owned by the core telecommunications carrier. If so then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported via a port out process. If the TN is owned by the core telecommunications carrier then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest as the TN has not yet been ported.

Returning to decision block if the TN does not equal the current LRN then the process continues to decision block where it is determined whether the current LRN is not owned by the core telecommunications carrier. If so then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported via a port out process. If the LRN is owned by the core telecommunications carrier then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest as the TN has not yet been ported.

Embodiments of the invention allow a PCT by performing process of to determine whether a particular TN has been ported and also specifically to determine whether the TN has been ported in ported out or migrated.

One embodiment of the invention provides customers with the ability to trigger the activation sequence of the porting process for the TNs associated with their orders. For a customer enabled with this port trigger capability all orders are set up to await the port trigger by the customer. In one embodiment the customer is able to trigger the porting on the FOC date only. On the FOC date if there are orders not yet triggered by a configurable activation time defined in a customer s profile usually at the end of the business day those orders will then be automatically activated.

Some embodiments of the invention allow for the customer to submit new port triggering orders thru a portal using manual entry or bulk entry. In some embodiments customers with B2B API capabilities may also submit new port trigger orders through API connections with the core telecommunications carrier once they have implemented the port trigger application.

In one embodiment as part of the port triggering functionality customers should enable port triggering in their customer profile. Whether a customer is planning to use the core telecommunication carrier s portal or order service B2B API to submit orders using the port triggering workflow profile parameters must be established. The following parameters should be set 1 Port Trigger Y N needs to be set to Y 2 AutoPort Y N needs to be set to Y and 3 Activation Time needs to be specified by the customer in MST. Other parameters may also be set in addition to the above parameters.

The port triggering process beings with a search for the Customer Order to be ported. In some embodiments the customer may search by Order ID or NPA NXX. are screenshots depicting various embodiments of customer order summary windows that display a summary of an LNP order that was searched. The Customer Order Summary screen allows the customer to review order detail for status and other information. For LNP orders an LNP Event Summary section may also be displayed in the order summary window such as that depicted in . In some embodiments the LNP Event Summary section is only present for LNP order requests. It is used to clearly communicate the event stages that occur between time of request and fulfillment allowing the customer to isolate and identify the action status of LNP order request.

With specific reference to the customer order summary of an Activation Type of customer initiated represents a customer with port triggering profile settings. A customer without this profile setting may instead have core telecommunications carrier initiated as the Activation Type. This field allows the customer to verify that the profile has been set accordingly. When the timing is right to activate the port process the Trigger Porting button displays on the customer order summary window and the Customer Commit Date matches today s date. In addition the General Information section will be updated to reflect that port activation has been initiated and where to turn for further assistance.

In some embodiments if an order contains multiple TNs the port triggering function may activate all TNs on the respective order. In addition if conditions for triggering ports are not met the Trigger Porting button may not display. A successful triggering of port will result in a Port Initiated message being displayed to the customer. In some embodiments this message may request that the customer allow a predetermined period of time before testing the success of the port. Note that the port may be completed and the TN activated well before the time window has passed however the customer should allow at least the period of the time window before initiating any troubleshooting.

In one embodiment to validate a port triggering occurrence or stage of activation the customer may work from the Order Summary screen of and click Return to Search Results then click the Search button again. The LNP status fields may show an updated status each time this action is performed. The following exemplary LNP status values described in Table 5 may be monitored but are not intended as limiting LNP status indicators for embodiments of the invention.

In some embodiments the port triggering functionality may also come with specific port triggering portal error codes that might be encountered upon triggering ports. Some exemplary non limiting errors codes with their corresponding descriptions are depicted below in Table 6.

In some embodiments attempting to activate the port trigger process out of the port triggering time frame can result in a response as seen the screen shot of which depicts one embodiment of a potential error result that may be presented to a customer.
