The field relates to information processing and more particularly to information processing techniques for managing data center configurations.

As is known a data center is a system comprised of computing resources including but not limited to processing resources and storage resources. In the context of a cloud computing infrastructure a data center is a web based system that is dynamically configurable to meet the computing needs of a customer. Customers typically order new services and products as well as upgrade existing services and products in their data center by communicating with a provider of such products and services.

However in existing data centers the customer s data center configuration may lack the ability to perform certain convenient or even necessary functions. Furthermore when a customer seeks to add new capabilities to an existing data center this may involve installing multiple new products in various product specific manners as well as learning multiple user interfaces. These drawbacks lead to an inefficient and perhaps frustrating experience for the data center customers.

Embodiments of the present invention provide information processing techniques for improved management of data center configurations.

In one embodiment a method comprises the following steps. A registry is maintained corresponding to at least one of products and services offered by a provider entity for use in providing a data center for a customer entity. A central interface is provided for presenting information maintained in the registry and for presenting one or more features operative to allow the customer entity to create and or change a configuration of the data center. The central interface also comprises one or more features for obtaining at least one of the data center products and services one or more features for configuring the obtained one of the data center products and services and one or more features for managing the configured one of the data center products and services. Accordingly the customer obtains a customized data center configuration through the central interface and the registry. One or more customer specific applications that implement at least a portion of the configuration of the data center of the customer entity may also be formed.

In another embodiment a computer program product is provided which comprises a processor readable storage medium having encoded therein executable code of one or more software programs. The one or more software programs when executed by a processor of a processing device implement steps of the above described method.

In yet another embodiment an apparatus comprises a memory and a processor operatively coupled to the memory and configured to perform steps of the above described method.

In a further embodiment a system comprises a registry and a central interface configured to perform steps of the above described method.

Advantageously embodiments of the data center management techniques described herein provide a common secure registry that can advertise all available common services to a storefront user interface such that the customer is able to securely select and purchase the capabilities and deploy them seamlessly via the same user interface. These common services once provisioned transform into one or more customer specific secure applications.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.

Embodiments of the present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary information processing systems computing systems data storage systems and associated servers computers storage units and devices and other processing devices. It is to be appreciated however that embodiments of the invention are not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown. Moreover the phrases information processing system computing system and data storage system as used herein are intended to be broadly construed so as to encompass for example private or public cloud computing or storage systems as well as other types of systems comprising distributed virtual infrastructure. However a given embodiment may more generally comprise any arrangement of one or more processing devices.

As used herein the term cloud refers to a collective computing infrastructure that implements a cloud computing paradigm. For example as per the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Special Publication No. 800 145 cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

As used herein the term product refers to an item or an object such as but not limited to one or more hardware components one or more software components or some combination thereof that may be obtained from a provider entity by a customer entity for use in conjunction with a data center.

As used herein the term service refers to a function or a process such as but not limited to one or more computing functions one or more storage functions or some combination thereof that may be provided by a provider entity to a customer entity for use in conjunction with a data center.

As used herein the term application refers to one or more computer programs designed to perform one or more functions when executed by a computing system. By way of example only this may include but is not limited to a database a spreadsheet a word processor as well as larger applications such as an enterprise resource planning ERP system. In addition an application can include one or more computer programs that perform one or more data center operations such as but not limited to backing up files indexing files for search managing the capacity of disks and protecting against attacks.

As will be described in further detail below the data center configuration management system comprises a registry of information corresponding to products and or services offered by a provider entity for use in providing a data center for a customer entity. The system also comprises a central interface for presenting the information maintained in the registry. The interface also presents one or more features operative to allow the customer entity to create and or change a configuration of the data center. The central interface also comprises one or more features for obtaining configuring and managing at least one of the data center products and services. Through use of the central interface in association with the registry the customer obtains a customized data center configuration. One or more customer specific applications e.g. one or more service applications that implement the configuration of the data center of the customer entity are also formed by the data center configuration management system .

Although the system elements and are shown as separate elements in these elements or portions thereof may be implemented at least in part on a common processing platform. In other embodiments one or more of the system elements and may each be implemented on a separate processing platform such as the processing platform to be described below in conjunction with . For example the cloud infrastructure may be implemented on a first processing device of a first processing platform and the data center configuration management system may be implemented on a second processing device of a second processing platform. It is also to be understood that a given embodiment of the system may include multiple instances of the elements and although only single instances of such elements are shown in the system diagram for clarity and simplicity of illustration.

As shown in a cloud infrastructure corresponding to in comprises virtual machines VMs . . . N implemented using a hypervisor . The hypervisor is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as virtualization infrastructure. The hypervisor runs on physical infrastructure e.g. such as may include CPU s and or storage units in . The cloud infrastructure further comprises sets of applications . . . N running on respective ones of the virtual machines . . . N under the control of the hypervisor .

Although only a single hypervisor is shown in the example of a given embodiment of cloud infrastructure configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may include multiple hypervisors each running on its own physical infrastructure. Portions of that physical infrastructure might be virtualized.

As is known virtual machines are logical processing elements that may be instantiated on one or more physical processing elements e.g. servers computers and processing devices . That is a virtual machine generally refers to a software implementation of a machine i.e. a computer that executes programs like a physical machine. Thus different virtual machines can run different operating systems and multiple applications on the same physical computer. Virtualization is implemented by the hypervisor which as shown in is directly inserted on top of the computer hardware in order to allocate hardware resources of the physical computer dynamically and transparently. The hypervisor affords the ability for multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical computer and share hardware resources with each other.

An example of a commercially available hypervisor platform that may be used to implement portions of the cloud infrastructure in one or more embodiments of the invention is the VMware vSphere which may have an associated virtual infrastructure management system such as the VMware vCenter . The underlying physical infrastructure may comprise one or more distributed processing platforms that include storage products such as VNX and Symmetrix VMAX both commercially available from EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass. A variety of other storage products may be utilized to implement at least a portion of the cloud infrastructure .

An example of a processing platform on which the cloud infrastructure and or the data center configuration management module of may be implemented is processing platform shown in . In one embodiment the processing platform is an information processing system. However processing platform could be a data storage system or a combination of an information processing system and a data storage system. The processing platform in this embodiment comprises at least a portion of the system and includes a plurality of servers denoted . . . P which communicate with one another over a network . One or more of the elements of system may therefore each run on a server computer or other processing platform element which may be viewed as an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a processing device. As illustrated in such a device generally comprises at least one processor and an associated memory and implements one or more functional modules for controlling certain features of system . Again multiple elements or modules may be implemented by a single processing device in a given embodiment.

The server in the processing platform comprises a processor coupled to a memory . The processor may comprise a microprocessor a microcontroller an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other type of processing circuitry as well as portions or combinations of such circuitry elements. The memory may be viewed as an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a computer program product. A computer program product comprises a processor readable storage medium having encoded therein executable code of one or more software programs. Such a memory may comprise electronic memory such as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM or other types of memory in any combination. The computer program code when executed by a processing device such as the server causes the device to perform functions associated with one or more of the elements of system . One skilled in the art would be readily able to implement such software given the teachings provided herein. Other examples of computer program products embodying embodiments of the invention may include for example optical or magnetic disks.

Also included in the server is network interface circuitry which is used to interface the server with the network and other system components. Such circuitry may comprise conventional transceivers of a type well known in the art.

The other servers of the processing platform are assumed to be configured in a manner similar to that shown for server in the figure.

The processing platform shown in may comprise additional known components such as batch processing systems parallel processing systems physical machines virtual machines virtual switches storage volumes logical units etc. Again the particular processing platform shown in the figure is presented by way of example only and system may include additional or alternative processing platforms as well as numerous distinct processing platforms in any combination.

Also numerous other arrangements of servers computers storage devices or other components are possible in system . Such components can communicate with other elements of the system over any type of network such as a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN a satellite network a telephone or cable network or various portions or combinations of these and other types of networks.

Illustrative details of the data center configuration management system will now be described with reference to .

As will be illustratively described herein embodiments of the invention implement a common secure registry that can advertise available common products and services of a vendor provider entity through an application storefront central user interface . Thus the customer customer entity is able to securely select and purchase data center capabilities products and services and deploy them seamlessly in a data center implementation via the same user interface. These common products and services once provisioned transform into one or more customer specific secure applications one or more service applications . The vendor provider entity provides these common products and services.

As shown main components of system comprise an application storefront one or more service applications a registry and a repository . The registry comprises a deployment and orchestration layer device application programming interfaces APIs repository APIs a security framework layer and core services . The repository comprises connect APIs through N and various platforms including indexing platform and data backup platform .

Application storefront is a graphical user interface through which a customer entity customer accesses the data center products and services provided by a provider entity vendor . The application storefront is one example of a central interface an example of which will be described below in the context of . As mentioned above the system generates one or more service applications which are customer specific applications that implement at least a portion of the configuration of the data center of the customer entity.

As shown the customer purchases a service application which is configured with one or more products and or services of the vendor. The vendor then publishes the service application. The customer can then among other things provision manage and administer the products and or services associated with the service application while the vendor can among other things monitor provision and administer the products and or services associated with the service application . By way of example only provision can mean to configure the data center e.g. allocate logical units in a data storage system . By way of further example only monitor can mean to observe the state of the data center. Still further by way of example only administer can refer to one or a combination of these terms. The customer and the vendor can communicate with the service application through various network communications protocols such as by way of example the HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP . Each service application is packaged with a normalized interface to the message bus allowing it to interoperate with multiple platforms products services placed in the repository .

Thus depicts a high level view of the deployment of the application purchased by a customer . Vendor is the entity who is selling data center applications to the customer and may be supporting the customer s data center in administration. For example assume in a use case that the vendor is EMC Corporation so the customer might be an entity who purchased a VNXe appliance e.g. in from EMC. The storefront is a central interface where one or more applications can be purchased from a data center marketplace. Assume further that a cloud infrastructure hosted by EMC runs the customer applications the registry e.g. place to store application templates customer records vendor records and the repository e.g. external data center services available over the protected cloud private cloud environment .

The message bus provides for asynchronous transfer of messages between different components in the system.

A common security model part of security framework utilized in the cloud environment ensures multi tenant separation common authentication and authorization and data protection.

Connect APIs through N virtualize access to the platforms of the repository making them accessible and reachable from the cloud layer. For example an indexing platform e.g. Kazeon from EMC Corporation can be invoked to index new files from a customer application running in the cloud infrastructure that is unaware of physical location infrastructure version and custom API. As an indexing request is received it is resolved at the registry locating the best repository service to which to route the request. An abstraction layer below isolates the actual service provider from the requester.

In one embodiment registry has two main functions 1 holds the recipe to create a new application in the cloud and deploy automatically for the entire cloud infrastructure and 2 validates and authorizes requests.

Thus with the first main function the registry has the recipe to put together a custom application for the customer order. To do this the registry has application templates which comprise a set of APIs for customer devices running the application APIs for the repository services to be used security method with certificates to identify an application to a customer and a vendor and automated configuration scripts to configure the network servers and storage. The registry also implements an automated process to deploy the application in the cloud infrastructure.

In the second main function once a virtual machine VM is deployed the registry provides the service e.g. as part of core services to authorize the access of a request since the registry stores the customer and vendor information. Registry thus serves as a quick look up database containing customer information purchased applications associated vendors authentication to repositories attached devices and support vendors. Each request goes through the registry look up to collect identifiers and locations and to perform authorization and authentication to execute a request.

Thus in one embodiment the registry includes functions including but not limited to a registration service a publication service a usage metering service a device platform customer and vendor master service administration and management services and reporting and logging services. The deployment and orchestration layer of the repository communicates with the message bus .

Note further that the message bus sends control messages back and forth between the service application the device the registry and the repository . For example a control message contains a noun a verb and a payload. The verbs are action items such as PUT GET FIND while the nouns describe the action to be performed e.g. NEWFILEINDEX and the payload contains references in forms of URIs uniform resource identifiers giving access to the actual data plus authentiation tokens to execute the operation.

Advantageously the customer is able to deploy products and or services that are customized specifically for them on a per customer basis and that may be based on intelligent assistance from the registry . Furthermore complex licensing issues that often arise in a customer s own implementation of a data center are now transparent from the perspective of the customer and absorbed by the cost of the service. The data center configuration management system also provides knowledge of license and authority of the services being operated performs secure information exchange and rights enabled isolation of customer information sets.

In one embodiment the container supports secure web services. Thus as shown the business logic of the service application communicates with the registry and repository over the message bus using RESTful web service HTTP. The service application communicates with a device adapter e.g. an interface used by device in in the same manner. As is known REST stands for Representational State Transfer which is a software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. RESTful refers to a web service implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST.

As shown a customer user first logs in to the application storefront in step . This may be done with a typical log in process e.g. username password etc. .

In step it is assumed that the customer chooses a performance monitoring application from a catalog feature on the interface. The customer may also read an online use script how to manual .

In step it is assumed that the customer purchases the performance monitoring application and begins to configure it. For example the performance monitoring software comes with default settings. Configuring in this example means that these default settings are modified or customized. Selection of the application is achieved by the customer clicking on the performace monitoring link feature in the interface .

In step the customer administers and monitors the application usage. An administrative interface not shown is provided to set edit options and settings for software customization and view usage patterns of the application.

By way of further example assume that a customer using a network attached storage NAS service wishes to add deduplication dedup and search index capabilities. The customer selects dedup and search index services from the storefront central interface which results in a secure customer specific deployment of two new service applications e.g. that leverage Kazeon and DataDomain technologies both commercially available from EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass. . The service application s in seamlessly integrates with the message bus in and inserts the business logic in of the two new capabilities into the existing NAS services via downloaded adapters in that can integrate to the existing NAS service.

Advantageously in accordance with embodiments of the invention customers now have a common way to purchase new data center capabilities and seamlessly add them into the data center. Further they now have an online catalog of products and services from which they can choose. Vendor products and services can now seamlessly be installed and effectively interoperate with any products services at the customer data center. Further such products and services can now be managed with a common user interface. Still further products and services offered by a vendor can now be offered seamlessly to multiple customers that wish to use them for their data center. In accordance with embodiments of the invention described herein there is now a standard way of measuring usage of service applications deployed into multiple customer data centers thereby allowing a data center provider to bill a customer based on service usage of any generic service offering.

Furthermore embodiments of the invention provide a combined cloud based web based and premises based infrastructure which facilitates the connection of service offerings and service recipients. Services can range from simple diagnostic services to full data mobility services. This is achieved in a secure infrastructure including a registry a repository a service message bus and a commerce portal central interface . Accordingly such dynamic services offering enables customers to seamlessly order install configure and integrate additional products services into their data centers as well as seamlessly add new tenants and mobile users into their data centers.

Still further embodiments of the invention realize that in complex environments the understanding of the relationships between one application service and other applications services is complex. Accordingly the data center configuration management system described herein and in particular the registry component in supports intelligent recommendation to the customer entity with respect to data center products services including functions and parameters associated with such products services. Advantageously in one or more embodiments such intelligent recommendation by the registry is accomplished by an introspection of local system sensors a model driven configuration optimization and continuous administration of the system configuration and associated data center assets.

It should again be emphasized that the above described embodiments of the invention are presented for purposes of illustration only. Many variations may be made in the particular arrangements shown. For example although described in the context of particular system and device configurations the techniques are applicable to a wide variety of other types of information processing systems processing devices and distributed virtual infrastructure arrangements. In addition any simplifying assumptions made above in the course of describing the illustrative embodiments should also be viewed as exemplary rather than as requirements or limitations of the invention. Numerous other alternative embodiments within the scope of the appended claims will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
