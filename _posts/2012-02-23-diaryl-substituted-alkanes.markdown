The instant invention involves compounds that inhibit 5 lipoxygenase activating protein FLAP compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment using such compounds for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and related diseases and conditions.

Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived through the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5 lipoxygenase.

One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5 lipoxygenase 5 LO . In general 5 LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5 LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently it has been reported that 5 LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process see Mehrabian M. et al. Circulation Research 2002 Jul. 26 91 2 120 126.

A new class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors now known as FLAP inhibitors distinct from 5 LO inhibitors is described in Miller D. K. et al. Identification and isolation of a membrane protein necessary for leukotriene production Nature vol. 343 No. 6255 pp. 278 281 18 Jan. 1990 . See also Dixon R. A. et al Requirement of a 5 lipoxygenase activating protein for leukotriene synthesis Nature vol 343 no. 6255 pp. 282 4 18 Jan. 1990 . 5 LO inhibitor compounds were used to identify and isolate the inner nuclear membrane 18 000 dalton protein 5 lipoxygenase activating protein FLAP . These compounds inhibit the formation of cellular leukotrienes but have no direct effect on soluble 5 LO activity. In cells arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of cytosolic phospholipase 2. This arachidonic acid is transferred to nuclear membrane bound 5 lipoxygenase by FLAP. The presence of FLAP in cells is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes. Additionally based on studies described in Helgadottir A. et al. Nature Genetics vol 36 no. 3 March 2004 pp. 233 239 it is believed that the gene encoding 5 lipoxygenase activating protein confers risk for myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.

Thus the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian especially human disease states such as erosive gastritis erosive esophagitis diarrhea cerebral spasm premature labor spontaneous abortion dysmenorrhea ischemia noxious agent induced damage or necrosis of hepatic pancreatic renal or myocardial tissue liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CCland D galactosamine ischemic renal failure disease induced hepatic damage bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage trauma or stress induced cell damage and glycerol induced renal failure. The compounds also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action.

The FLAP inhibitors of this invention can also be administered for prevention amelioration and treatment of glomerulonephritis see Guasch A. Zayas C. F. Badr K F. 1999 MK 591 acutely restores glomerular size selectivity and reduces proteinuria in human glomerulonephritis Kidney Int. 56 261 267 and also for and prevention amelioration and treatment of kidney damage resulting from diabetes complications see Valdivielso J M Montero A. Badr K F. Munger K A. 2003 Inhibition of FLAP decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats J. Nephrol. 16 1 85 940. 

In addition the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD . As described in S. Kilfeather Chest 2002 vol 121 197 airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD and reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations. In particular the compounds of this invention could be used for daily preferably once daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction associated with COPD including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants for example the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids strong bases ethanol hypertonic saline solutions and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are A an ethanol induced lesion assay and B an indomethacin induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140 684.

In particular the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co administration of a cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitor and low dose aspirin. Cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional non selective non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. However the combined use of a cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitor with low dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5 lipoxygenase inhibitor the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci et al. FASEB J. 17 1171 1173 2003. Cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to etoricoxib ARCOXIA and celecoxib CELEBREX . A compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low dose aspirin in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitor and aspirin for cardio protection may be utilized. Aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily.

The term patient includes mammals especially humans who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. The term prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment to slow progression of existing atherosclerosis and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or formation of new lesions.

In general FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICin the FLAP Binding Assay that is less than or equal to 1 M and preferably 500 nM or less more preferably 100 nM or less and most preferably 25 nM or less.

An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.01 mg kg to about 30 mg kg of body weight per day preferably 0.1 mg to about 15 mg per kg and most preferably 0.5 to 7.5 mg per kg in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. For an average body weight of 70 kg the dosage level is therefore from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg of drug per day e.g. 10 mg 25 mg 50 mg 75 mg 100 mg 125 mg 150 mg 175 mg 200 mg 250 mg or 500 mg per day preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to four times a day or in sustained release form. It will be understood however that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration rate of excretion drug combination and the severity of the patient s condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the FLAP inhibitor will administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient including a course of therapy lasting months years or the life of the patient.

One or more additional active agents may be administered with a compound of Formula II. The term additional active agent or agents is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent or agents different from the compound of Formula II. In a broad embodiment any suitable additional active agent or agents including but not limited to anti atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound anti diabetic agents and or anti obesity agents and agents used for the treatment of metabolic syndrome may be used in combination with the compound of Formula II in a single dosage formulation or may be administered to the patient in a separate dosage formulation which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. The additional active agent or agents may have more than one pharmaceutical activity for example it may have both lipid modifying effects and anti diabetic activity. Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to HMG CoA reductase inhibitors which include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof including but not limited to lovastatin see U.S. Pat. No. 4 342 767 simvastatin see U.S. Pat. No. 4 444 784 pravastatin particularly the sodium salt thereof see U.S. Pat. No. 4 346 227 fluvastatin particularly the sodium salt thereof see U.S. Pat.

No. 5 273 995 pitavastatin also referred to as NK 104 see PCT international publication number WO 97 23200 and rosuvastatin CRESTOR see U.S. Pat. No. 5 260 440 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors cholesterol ester transfer protein CETP inhibitors for example JTT 705 and torcetrapib also known as CP529 414 HMG CoA synthase inhibitors squalene epoxidase inhibitors squalene synthetase inhibitors also known as squalene synthase inhibitors acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase ACAT inhibitors including selective inhibitors of ACAT 1 or ACAT 2 as well as dual inhibitors of ACAT 1 and 2 microsomal triglyceride transfer protein MTP inhibitors niacin niacin receptor agonists such as acipimox and acifran as well as niacin receptor partial agonists bile acid sequestrants LDL low density lipoprotein receptor inducers platelet aggregation inhibitors for example glycoprotein IIb IIIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma PPAR agonists including the compounds commonly referred to as glitazones for example pioglitazone and rosiglitazone and including those compounds included within the structural class known as thiazolidinediones as well as those PPAR agonists outside the thiazolidinedione structural class PPAR agonists such as clofibrate fenofibrate including micronized fenofibrate and gemfibrozil PPAR dual agonists vitamin B also known as pyridoxine and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof such as the HCl salt vitamin B also known as cyanocobalamin folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt anti oxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and E and beta carotene beta blockers angiotensin II antagonists such as losartan angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril and captopril calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and diltiazam endothelian antagonists agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression FXR and LXR ligands including both inhibitors and agonists bisphosphonate compounds such as alendronate sodium and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib celecoxib and valdecoxib.

Other advantageous pharmaceutical combinations comprise the compounds of this invention in combination with anti cholinergics such as ipratropium bromide and tiotropium bronchodilators such as the beta agonist salbutamol metaproterenol terbutaline fenoterol salmeterol formoterol and the like and the anti asthmatic drugs theophylline choline theophyllinate and enprofylline the calcium antagonists nifedipine diltiazem nitrendipine verapamil nimodipine felodipine etc. and the corticosteroids hydrocortisone methylprednisolone betamethasone dexamethasone beclomethasone and the like.

Particularly for the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma compounds of this invention can be used in combination with orally inhaled corticosteroids such as beclomethasone e.g. QVAR Inhalation Aerosol budesonide e.g. Pulmicort Respules flunisolide e.g. AEROBID and AEROBID M Inhaler System fluticasone e.g. FLOVENT DISKUS inhalation powder FLOVENT HFA Inhalation Aerosol mometasone e.g. ASMANEX TWISTHALER and triamcinolone e.g. AZMACORT Inhalation Aerosol and also with inhaled corticosteroid LABA products such as fluticasone propionate salmeterol e.g. ADVAIR DISKUS . The instant compounds could also be used in combination with leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast e.g. SINGULAIR phosphodiesterase 4 PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast N Cyclopropyl 1 3 1 oxido 3 pyridinylethynyl phenyl 1 4 dihydro 1 8 naphthyridin 4 one 3 carboxamide and the compounds disclosed in PCT Publication WO2003 018579 and Very Late Antigen 4 VLA4 inhibitors such as the compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 229 011 particularly R411 N 2 Chloro 6 methylbenzoyl 4 2 6 dichlorobenzoyl amino L phenylalanine 2 diethylamino ethyl ester which is an ester pro drug of the active moiety N 2 chloro 6 methylbenzoyl 4 2 6 dichlorobenzoyl amino L phenylalanine and the compounds disclosed in PCT publication WO2006 023396.

Still another type of agent that can be used in combination with the compounds of this invention are cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall. This blockade is their primary mode of action in reducing serum cholesterol levels. These compounds are distinct from compounds which reduce serum cholesterol levels primarily by mechanisms of action such as acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyl transferase ACAT inhibition inhibition of triglyceride synthesis MTP inhibition bile acid sequestration and transcription modulation such as agonists or antagonists of nuclear hormones. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 846 966 5 631 365 5 767 115 6 133 001 5 886 171 5 856 473 5 756 470 5 739 321 5 919 672 6 498 156 US2004 0082561 US2004 0067913 US2004 0063929 US2002 0137689 WO 05 047248 WO 05 021497 WO 05 021495 WO 05 000353 WO 04 005247 WO 00 63703 WO 00 60107 WO 00 38725 WO 00 34240 WO 00 20623 WO 97 45406 WO 97 16424 WO 97 16455 and WO 95 08532. An exemplary cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe marketed in the U.S. under the tradename ZETIA described in U.S. Pat. No. Re 37721 and the Physician s Desk Reference.

This and other cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be identified according to the assay of hypolipidemic compounds using the hyperlipidemic hamster described in U.S. Patent Re 37721 beginning in column 20 in which hamsters are fed a controlled cholesterol diet and dosed with test compounds for seven days. Plasma lipid analysis is conducted and data is reported as percent reduction of lipid versus control.

Therapeutically effective amounts of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include dosages of from about 0.01 mg kg to about 30 mg kg of body weight per day preferably about 0.1 mg kg to about 15 mg kg. For an average body weight of 70 kg the dosage level is therefore from about 0.7 mg to about 2100 mg of drug per day e.g. 10 20 40 100 or 200 mg per day preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day or in sustained release form. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response when the cholesterol absorption inhibitor is used in combination with a compound of the instant invention.

Sweetening agents such as those set forth above and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti oxidant such as ascorbic acid.

Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients for example sweetening flavoring and coloring agents may also be present.

For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.

The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula II with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula II with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The following reaction schemes illustrate the methods employed in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention of structural Formula U. All abbreviations are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.

Reaction scheme A illustrates a preferred method of synthesis of a compound type 10. In this method a ketone or aldehyde of type 1 is treated with an organometallic reagent of type 2 capable of transferring an aryl group to afford a compound of type 3. Preferred organometallic reagents for effecting this transformation include organolithium 2 M Li and organomagnesium 2 M Mg Grignard compounds. When organolithium reagents are employed the reaction can be conducted in a variety of solvents such as hexanes or diethyl ether or the like at temperatures between 78 C. and rt. When Grignard reagents are employed as shown in scheme A it is customary to conduct the reaction in a suitable ethereal solvent such as THF or diethyl ether or mixtures thereof at temperatures between 78 C. and the boiling temperature of the solvent. The organolithium and Grignard reagents are commonly purchased from commercial sources but can be prepared synthetically according to known methods of organic synthesis. The resulting alcohol 3 can be treated with a protected aminomethylfuran derivative of type 4 in an electrophilic aromatic substitution process generally referred to as a Friedel Crafts arylation reaction. The preferred protecting group for the amino functionality in 4 as depicted in scheme A is phthalimide but is by no means limited to such a group. Typical conditions for performing the arylation of 3 include the generation of an intermediate carbocation of type 5 derived from 3 followed by in situ trapping with a suitable aromatic coupling partner of type 4 to afford a product of type 6. It is customary to conduct the reaction in the presence of either suitable Bronstead acids such as tetrafluoboric acid or the like or Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride or the like 2005 127 9348 9349 . The reaction may also be performed in the presence of a variety of inert organic solvents such as dichloromethane or 1 2 dichloroethane or the like at temperatures typically between 78 C. and P. Preferred conditions for removal of the phthalimide protecting group involve treatment of 6 with reagents such as sodium methoxide or hydrazine or n butylamine in solvents such as MeOH or EtOH at temperatures typically between it and the boiling temperature of the solvent. The product of the reaction is an amine of type 7 which can be transformed to a compound of type 8 in the presence of a suitable activating reagent such as bromine or iodine. The reaction can be conducted in a variety of aqueous solvent mixtures that include solvents such as MeOH or EtOH or the like at temperatures between rt and 20 C.

Usually the reaction is performed in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate or the like in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMF at temperatures between 20 C. and 50 C. 1956 10 1603 1605 . The product of the reaction is 10 which can be further elaborated to other compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme B illustrates a preferred method of synthesis of a compound of type 18. In this method an acid chloride derivative of type 11 often generated from the respective carboxylic acid precursor using methods known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis is treated with an organometallic reagent of type 12 or type 13 to afford a product of type 14. Preferred organometallic reagents for effecting this transformation include organomagnesium Grignard and organozinc compounds. When Grignard reagents 12 are employed the preferred conditions are similar to those described in scheme A. When organozinc reagents 13 are employed the reaction is generally conducted in the presence of a suitable organotransition metal catalyst such as bis triphenylphosphino palladium II dichloride or copper I chloride or the like in a variety of solvents such as THF or diethyl ether at temperatures between 20 C. and rt 1993 93 2117 2188 . The Grignard and organozinc reagents are commonly purchased from commercial sources but can be prepared synthetically according to known methods of organic synthesis. The resulting ketone 14 can then be treated with an organometallic reagent of type 2 under similar conditions to those described in scheme A to furnish a product of type 15. The hydroxyl group in 15 can be removed in a reaction sequence commonly referred to as the Barton McCombie Deoxygenation strategy 11975 1574 1585 . The reaction process requires initial activation of the hydroxyl moeity which is achieved via alkylation of this group with a reagent such as phenyl thionochloroformate in the presence of a suitable tertiary amine base such as pyridine to afford a thiocarbonate derivative of type 16. Acylations of this type can be conducted in a variety of inert organic solvents such as dichloromethane or 1 2 dichloroethane at temperatures typically between 20 C. and rt. Alternatively a xanthate derivative of type 17 may also be prepared often by a three step sequence involving treatment of 15 with a base such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride followed by introduction of carbon disulfide and finally in situ alkylation with an agent such as methyl iodide. Xanthate formation is generally performed in an ethereal solvent such as THF or diethyl ether at temperatures typically between 20 C. and it. Deoxygenation of 16 or 17 can be effected with a reducing agent such as a trialkylltin hydride often in the presence of a free radical initiator such as AIBN or the like. Reactions of this type are performed in an inert organic solvent such as benzene or toluene or dimethoxyethane that has been appropriately degassed and at temperatures often corresponding to the boiling temperature of the solvent. It may be preferable to use an additive such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide or the like to accelerate or promote the reaction. The product is a compound of type 18 which can be elaborated to compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme C illustrates a preferred method for the elaboration of a compound of type 19 to afford a compound of type 20. In this method 19 is treated with MeOH in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst such as 1 1 bis diphenylphosphino ferrocene dichloropalladium II or the like and a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine or the like in an inert organic solvent like DMF. The reaction is usually conducted at elevated temperature typically between 50 C. and 100 C. for periods of 3 24 h under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide 1974 39 3318 3326 . In certain cases it may be preferable to use elevated pressures of carbon monoxide or an additive such as lithium chloride to promote or accelerate the reaction. The product of the reaction is an ester of type 20 which can be elaborated to compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme D illustrates a preferred method for the elaboration of a compound type 19 to afford a compound of type 21. In this method 19 is treated with a cyanide source such as potassium cyanide or trimethylsilylcyanide or the like in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst ligand reagent system. It may be preferable to use an inorganic additive such as a copper I salt and or a base such as triethylamine to accelerate or promote the reaction. It is customary to conduct the reaction in inert organic solvent preferably a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF or NMP or MeCN at elevated reaction temperatures typically between 50 140 C. for a period of 3 24 hours. The product of the reaction is a nitrile of type 21 which can be elaborated to compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme E illustrates a preferred method of synthesis of compounds of structural formula 24.

The triflating reaction is typically performed in aprotic organic solvents such as DCM or THF at temperatures that range from 78 C. to room temperature. Compounds of type 27 can then be treated with a terminal alkyne of type 28 in an organotransition metal catalyzed cross coupling process commonly referred to as the Sonogashira reaction. The reaction is performed in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst and a copper I co catalyst such as copper I iodide and typically employs an excess of an amine base such as triethylamine and diethylamine. The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as DMF at temperatures ranging from ambient temperature to about 100 C. for a period of 3 24 hours. The product of the reaction is an alkyne of type 29 which can then be converted into an alkene derivative of type 30 or a saturated alkane derivative of type 31. If 30 is desired preferred conditions for performing the partial reduction of 29 involve the use of a Lindlar catalyst reagent system under an atmospheric or elevated pressure of hydrogen. The reaction is usually conducted in an inert organic solvent such as EtOH and EtOAc or combinations thereof and at room temperature for a period of 3 15 hours.

Reaction scheme K illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of compounds of structural formula 39 40 and 41. In this method 38 is treated with either allyltributylstannane or vinyltributylstannane in the presence of a suitable a palladium catalyst such as 1 1 bis diphenylphosphino ferrocene dichloropalladium II in an inert organic solvent like DMF or NMP. The reaction is usually conducted at elevated temperatures typically between 50 120 C. for periods of 2 24 hours. In certain cases it may be essential to use an additive such as lithium chloride to promote the reaction. Often the reaction times can be significantly reduced if the reaction is conducted under microwave irradiation. The product of the reaction is an alkene of structural formula 39 which can be synthetically elaborated using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis. For example 39 can be oxidatively cleaved to afford an aldehyde of type 40 which can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid derivative of structural formula 41. A preferred method for the oxidative cleavage reaction is the two step process shown in reaction scheme I. Alkene 39 is first oxidized to a vicinal diol using catalytic osmium tetraoxide in the presence of a stoichiometric reoxidant such as NMO in a solvent system such as acetone water. The intermediate vicinal diol which forms is generally not isolated but is in turn subjected to cleavage with sodium periodate in a suitable mixed solvent system like THF water to afford 40. Both steps in the oxidative cleavage sequence are generally completed during periods of several minutes to a few hours at temperatures between 0 C. and room temperature. Aldehyde 40 can then be further oxidized to 41 using a buffered chlorite oxidation system. In this method 40 is treated with sodium chlorite and monobasic sodium phosphate in the presence of a chlorine scavenger such as 2 methyl 2 butene. The reaction is conducted typically in a solvent system like n butanol water for periods of 1 6 hours at temperatures between 0 C. and room temperature. In certain cases 40 can be directly converted to 41 using the sodium periodate ruthenium trichloride reagent system. Both 40 and 41 can be elaborated in numerous ways known in organic synthesis to furnish other compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme L illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of compounds of structural formula 43. In the most general case 41 is treated with an amine of type 42 to afford an amide of type 43. The amide bond coupling reaction illustrated in reaction scheme L is conducted in an appropriate inert solvent such as DMF DCM or the like and may be performed with a variety of reagents suitable for amide coupling reactions such as HATU EDC or PyBOP. Preferred conditions for the amide bond coupling reaction shown in reaction Scheme M are known to those skilled in organic synthesis. Such modifications may include but are not limited to the use of basic reagents such as triethylamine DIPEA or NMM or the addition of an additive such as HOAt or HOBt. Alternatively 42 may be treated with an activated ester or acid chloride derivative of 41 which also affords 43. The amide bond coupling shown in reaction Scheme L is usually conducted at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature occasionally at elevated temperatures and the coupling reaction is typically conducted for periods of 1 to 24 hours.

Reaction scheme M illustrates a preferred method for the synthesis of a compound of type 45. In this method 41 is subjected to the Curtius reaction to afford a N Boc protected amine derivative of structural formula 44. The reaction is performed by reacting 41 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or DIPEA in a solvent such as toluene. The initial product is generally accepted to be the acyl azide which is rearranged to the isocyanate in a thermal process analogous to the Wolff rearrangement of acyl carbenes. The rearrangement is conducted typically at the reflux temperature of the solvent for instance 110 C. and the rearrangement is usually completed in periods of 1 5 hours. The intermediate isocyanate which forms is generally not isolated but is in turn subjected to in situ reaction with a suitable alcohol such as tert butyl alcohol to afford carbamate 44. The N Boc group can be removed by a suitable deprotection method such as treatment with hydrogen chloride in EtOAc or TFA in DCM. The deprotection is conducted typically at temperatures between 0 C. and room temperature and the reaction is usually complete in 0.5 3 hours. The product amine of structural formula 45 can be used as a coupling partner using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis to afford compounds of the present invention I .

Reaction scheme N illustrates preferred methods for the syntheses of compounds of type 48. For example 45 can participate in amide bond coupling reactions with a carboxylic acid of type 46 to afford an amide structural formula 48 using the reagents and conditions described for the generalized amide coupling protocol shown in reaction Scheme L. Alternatively 45 may also be treated with an activated ester or acid chloride derivative of type 47 which also affords 48. Typical conditions for effecting such a transformation include treatment of 45 with acid chloride 47 in the presence of excess tertiary amine base such as triethylamine. It is customary to perform the reaction in an inert organic solvent such as DMF or DCM at temperatures between 0 C. and the reflux temperature of the solvent frequently at room temperature and for periods of 1 24 hours.

As shown in reaction scheme O 45 can also be elaborated using the Fukuyama modification of the Mitsunobu reaction Fukuyama T. Jow C. K. Cheung M. 1995 36 6373 74 . For example 45 may be reacted with an arylsulfonyl chloride such as 2 nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride 4 nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride or 2 4 dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride and a tertiary amine base such as 2 4 6 collidine or 2 6 lutidine in an inert organic solvent such as DCM. Alternatively the reaction can also be performed under the classical Schotten Baumann conditions as shown in scheme O in which 45 and the arylsulfonyl chloride are allowed to react in aqueous alkaline solution. The product of this reaction is the sulfonamide of type 49 which can be further modified by reaction with an alcohol of type 50 in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as DEAD DIAD or the like. The reaction is performed in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene toluene THF or mixtures thereof typically at room temperature and the reaction is generally complete in 0.5 3 hours. The product of this reaction is the dialkylsulfonamide of type 51 which can be desulfonylated by treatment with either a nucleophilic amine like n propylamine in a solvent such as DCM or with mercaptoacetic acid and triethylamine in DCM. In either case the reaction is conducted typically at room temperature for periods of 5 minutes to 1 hour. When a 2 or 4 nitrobenzenesulfonyl derivative is employed the cleavage of the sulfonamide is accomplished with either the combination of thiophenol and potassium carbonate in a solvent like DMF or with mercaptoacetic acid and lithium hydroxide in DMF. In either case the reaction is conducted at room temperature for periods of 1 3 hours. The secondary amine product of type 52 can be modified further using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis to provide other compounds of the present invention I . For example 52 may be subjected to a reductive amination reaction with an aldehyde or ketone of type 53 using the conditions described in the bottom of reaction Scheme O to afford compounds of type 54.

Scheme P illustrates in the most generalized manner how compounds of type 55 can be elaborated to a variety of heterocyclic derivatives of structural formula 56 using known methods in organic synthesis. Specific examples of such transformations are shown in the Examples section.

Scheme Q illustrates the preferred method for the resolution of a racemic compound of structural formula 57 in which the asterisked carbon is a center of chirality. Generally the latter or intermediates en route to their preparation may be resolved to afford enantiomerically pure compounds such as 58 and 59 by employing chiral stationary phase liquid chromatography techniques or other suitable methods known in organic synthesis.
