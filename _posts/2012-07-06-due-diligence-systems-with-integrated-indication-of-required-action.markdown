title: Due diligence systems with integrated indication of required action
abstract: A system for performing due diligence on electronically stored documents is provided. A dynamic due diligence item (DDDI) is created by one user and associated with a particular document or piece of information by the system. The created DDDI is assigned to another user. The created DDDI is then routed by the system over a computer network to another user for review of the DDDI and the associated particular document or piece of information. In certain instances, after receiving the notification and opening the document, the system may enforce upon the second user a required action when the DDDI is presented.

The technology herein relates to systems and methods that facilitate the performance of due diligence in an electronic environment. More particularly the technology herein relates to virtual data rooms where users can access documents and other information in performing dynamic due diligence.

At an individual level we all weigh various factors as to whether a particular action should be taken. For example when shopping at a grocery store we may look at the ingredients on a carton of ice cream determine which brand of milk to purchase or test whether or not a pineapple is ripe. All of these inquires relate to making an informed decision or purchase given our particular needs and desires. Companies and individuals also make similar types of inquires when an action is to be taken. Collectively such inquiries into the overall action can be referred to as due diligence. 

Due diligence includes research analysis and other inquiries into matters related to a particular action. Accordingly due diligence is usually more than just document review. It relates to research and identifying source documents coming up with a process of deciding what or whether a particular action should be taken or determining the value of the business or asset being acquired. Thus due diligence may relate to understanding what is in a document or information with a specific goal in mind.

One example of due diligence is in the area of mergers and acquisitions M A where looking at the assets liabilities debt and other issues for the proposed transaction are virtual requirements before a transaction can be completed. However review research analysis of this nature can be time consuming as there may be thousands of documents large databases of information or other items that need to be reviewed before a transaction can be carried out.

A conventional approach to performing due diligence in such situations may be fairly static where the documents are physically placed into one room. Then access to that room is controlled. Lawyers accountants and other individuals or teams may then be allowed access the room to review analyze all of the collected information. However the inventors recognized such an approach has several problems.

For example there is no or very little integrity checking to determine what has actually been reviewed out of the thousands of documents in the room. A further problem is that even if access is controlled to the room there is no enforcement scheme to ensure the documents stay intact. As one example one person may discover a had piece of evidence for their side and may take actions e.g. ripping or tearing up the page to destroy the evidence. Thus key pieces of information that affect the overall due diligence process may be tainted altered or destroyed.

Moreover because the documents are physically located the people responsible for performing due diligence must physically travel to the location of the documents and information.

Virtual data rooms VDR have been created to allow companies and individuals to conduct due diligence in a virtual environment. VDRs may be an attractive alternative because of cost savings and other advantages e.g. allowing multiple people to view a document simultaneously . However problems are still associated with the use of such conventional virtual data rooms.

In a VDR environment User A may share a document with User B by sending him an email message to review the document. However simply sending a message to review a document does not provide control over the document or dictate how users interact with the document. This may lead to certain questions e.g. of relevance in a due diligence environment being unanswered. For example did User B review the document or not Did User B review the page of the document that user A had a question about Did user B respond is some actionable way to User A s request Does user A know that user B reviewed the page Leaving these and other questions unanswered may lead to adverse consequences. Accordingly new techniques for carrying out or facilitating clue diligence in an electronic environment are still needed.

In certain example embodiments due diligence workflows may be created as part of a virtual data room. In certain instances such due diligence workflows may be dynamic due diligence items DDDI that allow an initiating user to both share a document or other piece of information with a receiving user and request or require the receiving user to respond in some meaningful way. In other words a receiving user that receives a due diligence item related to a document may be required to acknowledge or take some other affirmative action before the system allows the receiving user to proceed with other tasks e.g. such as viewing the remainder of the shared document .

In certain example embodiments a system for performing due diligence on a plurality of documents is provided. The plurality of documents are electronically stored and accessible to a plurality of users over a computer network. The plurality of users includes a first user and a second user and a storage medium system is configured to store the plurality of documents. The system also includes a processing system with at least one processor. The processing system is configured to receive a request from a first dynamic due diligence terminal associated with a first user to view a document in the plurality of documents. The processing system is configured to retrieve the document from the storage medium system. The processing system is configured to display the retrieved document at the first dynamic clue diligence terminal for review by the first user. The processing system is configured to select at least the second user out of the plurality of users based on user input.

The processing system is configured to assign the created dynamic due diligence item to at least the second user. The processing system is configured to associate the created dynamic due diligence item to the document. The processing system is configured to store the created dynamic due diligence item to the storage medium system. The processing system is configured to display the document at a second dynamic due diligence terminal for review by the second user. The processing system is configured to integrate an indication of the dynamic due diligence item into the displayed document. The processing system is configured to display the dynamic due diligence item at the second dynamic due diligence terminal the dynamic due diligence item including a required action that the second user is required to take in order to satisfy the dynamic due diligence item. The processing system is configured to receive input from the second user via the second dynamic due diligence terminal responsive to display of the dynamic due diligence item. The processing system is configured to generate and store an indication to the storage medium system that the dynamic due diligence item is satisfied when the received input from the second user is in accordance with the required action of the dynamic due diligence item.

In certain aspects the required action includes an acknowledgement by the second user of the assignment to the second user.

In certain implementations the first dynamic due diligence terminal includes a first processor of the at least one processors. The second dynamic due diligence terminal is remotely located from the first terminal and includes a second processor of the at least one processors. The processing system includes the first dynamic due diligence terminal the second dynamic due diligence terminal and a server system that includes at least a third processor of the at least one processors. The first and second dynamic due diligence terminals are configured to communicate with the server system over the computer network.

An aspect includes encrypting the stored documents and decrypting a document before display on a terminal.

In certain examples a notification is sent to a second user that a dynamic due diligence item has been created.

In certain example embodiments the processing system is further configured to annotate a portion of the document based on input from a user. The annotated portion of the document is then associated with the created dynamic due diligence item.

An aspect includes obscuring at least some of the annotated portion with the presentation of the DDDI at least until the required action is input by the second user. In certain instances a DDDI includes comments that have been provided by the first or second users. Such comments are then displayed. An aspect includes assigning the DDDI from among a list of users that are authorized to have DDDIs assigned to them.

In certain examples the processing system is configured to receive recommendations on a document stored by the system wherein the recommendation may be for a portion of the document. A recommendation may have multiple different levels. In certain implementations A recommendation score is calculated and displayed based on all recommendations associated with the document.

A non transitory computer readable medium storing computer readable instructions for use with a virtual data room system for conducting dynamic due diligence on information that is segmented into a plurality of different information portions that are stored in a storage medium system that is remotely accessible to a plurality of users is provided. The plurality of users include a first user and a second user.

The dynamic due diligence item is set to be integrated into the first file when displayed to the second user on the second remote computer system. The dynamic due diligence item includes an input requirement that the second user is required to take in order to satisfy the dynamic due diligence item. An indication is stored to the storage medium system that the input requirement of the dynamic due diligence item is satisfied when data transmitted from the second remote computer system indicates that the second user provided input that is in accordance with the input requirement.

The above features may be combined to form additional embodiments and sub elements of certain embodiments may form further embodiments.

Related feature are described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled COLLABORATIVE DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW SYSTEM attorney docket number 4010 237 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such features may form additional embodiments.

A dynamic due diligence item DDDI is created and used by users of a system. For example users may interact with a virtual data room VDR to create modify review etc. a DDDI that is associated with a particular document or other piece of information stored in the VDR.

In initiating user is reviewing a document that is provided via the virtual data room via a client system e.g. a due diligence terminal . As discussed in greater detail below a client system may be a computing resource that is a personal computing device a mobile device or any other type of computing system that allows the user to access e.g. remotely information stored in the virtual data room .

When reviewing a document on client system initiating user decides to create a new workflow e.g. a DDDI associated with the document being reviewed by the initiating user . The new workflow includes a list of users to assign the workflow to and an optional comments section . Initiating user selects Erica and Alan as the users assigned to the workflow and then includes a brief note so that the users receiving the workflow may have some context for the received workflow.

The newly created workflow is saved with the virtual data room which then notifies both Erica and Alan that a workflow is now assigned to them. When the workflow is saved to the virtual data room additional processing may take place to store information related to the workflow into a database or other storage medium so that the save information may be retrieved at a later time.

Notification of a workflow may be carried via for example email with a link to the workflow and the document that the workflow is associated with. In certain example embodiments the context of the workflow may be displayed to the users in the form of a notification with an instruction to retrieve the document at a later date. For example if a notified user is using a mobile device e.g. with a small display it may not be practical to completely review the requested document. Thus only the comment associated with the created workflow may be displayed.

In any event the workflow is then retrieved and opened by Erica and Alan via respective client systems and . The retrieved work flow is displayed with information concerning who created the workflow e.g. Adam any comments associated with the workflow and actionable buttons and . In certain example embodiments a user that has a workflow assigned to them may be required to interact with an actionable item e.g. button or before the portion of the document in question that the workflow is associated with may be displayed to the user. The workflow may also include a reply text field that allows users to input reply comments to the originally assigning user in this example Adam . Receiving users and may acknowledge the assigned workflow . This acknowledgement is then stored with the virtual data room for future use.

Managers or other supervisors may use the stored information to determine how well a particular due diligence process is proceeding. Such views may be collected and presented to more senior level managers to provide a quick overview of the progress being made e.g. 50 of the documents have been reviewed or that the legal department has 15 DDDIs that are open or un resolved . Such reporting may allow for quicker re tasking of resources or determining who is working and who is not.

The initiating user may also associate a type of action that he wants an assigned receiving user to take with the document or portion thereof . Such actions may include for example acknowledging e.g. via button posting a reply e.g. via button having the assigned user respond to a question e.g. a yes no question or the like . Such actions may be combined to allow for example a reply response to via button to automatically register an acknowledgement response with the virtual data room system .

Also the responses and recordation of how users interact with exemplary workflows may be analyzed and or collated for review. For example the manager of a department may be able to keep track of employees to make sure they are reviewing and acknowledging documents.

In certain example embodiments other types of actions may be tracked by the virtual data room . For example each time a particular document or file is opened by a user the virtual data room may record such information. In another implementation the page numbers or how long particular page was viewable on a screen may be recorded. For example the virtual data room may record that Erica receiving user had page of an environmental impact statement displayed to her for 30 minutes. This information may then be reported upon at a later date e.g. to confirm that a document was reviewed or a particular passage in the document was reviewed .

In sum users and or may interact with the virtual data room system in order to carry out dynamic due diligence on the information documents stored in the virtual data room .

The due diligence system also includes layers such as the application data layer the business logic layer and the presentation layer . These layers may include software components that configure processing systems to carry out certain tasks.

The application data layer may include data access logic and or mediums that store data related to the dynamic due diligence system . For example the core system database may store information regarding documents and or information that are associated with a particular due diligence project. The annotations database may store annotations created by users e.g. in for particular documents or portions of documents.

The business logic layer provides business logic functionality. For example the dynamic due diligence business logic may act to enforce a particular requirement that an acknowledgement is received before allowing a user to view a given document.

The presentation layer may include components that allow users to view documents information etc via different mediums. In certain example embodiments web services for mobile applications may provide functionality for handheld devices e.g. smart phones . In certain example embodiments a custom view may be used to present the information to a user. In certain example embodiments a web page interface may be used by users to access view and or interact with the system. In certain example embodiments the functionality of the various presentation layers may vary depending on the client system that is accessing the due diligence system . For example document viewing may be available only through a custom document viewer while other layers may present reduced functionality e.g. because they are less secure .

In other words in certain example embodiments the dynamic due diligence system may be provided via a three tier architecture data access business logic and presentation . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other architecture models e.g. multitier or N tier architecture MVC or the like may be employed to implement the techniques processes methods etc described herein.

The due diligence system may also include a cloud security layer . This layer may include functionality for preventing unauthorized access to information that is maintained by the due diligence system .

An assignor workflow begins with a user reviewing a document. For example the The Forrester Wave Mobile Collaboration Q3 2011 document shown in . In step the user creates an annotation for the document being reviewed. In certain example embodiments an annotation is created and associated with a given document or piece of information as a whole. As an example a user may review a document concerning the estimated valuation of a company s patent portfolio. The user may then create an annotation and associated workflow or dynamic due diligence item that is associated with the whole document.

Alternatively as shown in the user may create the annotation and associate it with a portion or section of the document. In the lines from Yammer to categories are all highlighted e.g. annotated by the user and associated with a DDDI. In certain examples the user may draw on the document by circling or other wise marking up the portions that he she wishes the annotation to be associated with e.g. drawing an arrow underlining strike through making any type of drawing . Accordingly various techniques may be implemented to allow a user to select or otherwise specify a portion of a document or information that the created annotation is to be associated with.

In step the annotation may be shared by assigning it to another user. This is graphically shown in with the Assign to Someone dialog box. In the above discussed example Adam may share an annotation with Erica. As described in more detail below the list of users that is displayed may be controlled via group policy settings such that groups or teams of people can only assign new annotations to other users within their team. In other words not all of the users of a particular virtual data room may be available for assignment.

In step a notification is sent via email to the user that the annotation is assigned to. Thus continuing with the above example Erica may receive an email indicating that Adam has assigned her an annotation that is associated with a particular document. Other forms of notification may also be used. For example text messages automated phone calls notification through a secure email system etc.

In certain example embodiments the notification may be associated with a priority and the priority may be used to determine how an alert is sent to a user. For example regular or low priority notifications may not generate emails but instead may alert the assigned user through an exemplary virtual data room application e.g. as shown in the screen shots . In certain instances assignments that are high priority may be emailed to a specified email address or may trigger a text message or phone call in certain example embodiments the priority may be automatically assigned e.g. as a default .

In step the viewer that is used by users for the document in question e.g. the The Forrester Wave Mobile Collaboration Q3 2011 in may be updated to show that an annotation is now associated with a portion of the document. For example an icon as shown in may be used to indicate that an annotation and associated DDDI is present. In certain example embodiments the annotation may be viewable to all users or may only be viewable to a subset of users that are associated with the document e.g. assignor users or assignee users .

As users reply to or otherwise acknowledge an annotation the originally created annotation may be updated to show the assignor the updated status. For example in the display of the created annotation is updated after Carl Crossover acknowledges the annotation e.g. by hitting an acknowledge button . Similarly as shown in when a user replies the text of the reply is displayed to the users who open the annotation.

Returning to in certain instances a user may desire to cancel an annotation assignment or a DDDI. However the system may only allow annotations or other items to be canceled deleted when certain conditions are met. Thus in step and shown in an assignment or annotation may be canceled. In certain example embodiments canceling may remove one or more users from the created annotation. If there are no users left after cancellation then the entire annotation may be canceled. In certain example embodiments the annotation or DDDI may be canceled or otherwise removed from the system. In certain example embodiments cancellations actions may only be carried out when users have not already responded to the annotation or an action has not already been taken with the created DDDI. For example after Carl crossover responds as shown in the annotation may not be canceled by the assignor. In any event if the created DDDI and associated annotation is canceled then in step the originally assigned user may be notified that the DDDI that they were assigned to has been canceled. In certain example embodiments the system may require that the users enter a reason for canceling the DDDI.

As discussed above assignees may be notified that a new dynamic due diligence item with an associated annotation has been assigned to them. In certain examples an email message may be sent to a user with a link to open a document. Another example is shown in where an alert indication is present within a document viewer. Such indications may allow a user to open and or consider annotations and their linked documents or portions thereof relatively quickly. The alert indication in shows the number of alerts of the current document and allows users to successively click on the alerts button to jump between multiple alerts if there is more than one alert for a document .

As shown in when an alert is presented to a user the dialog box that is associated with the annotated portion of the document may be placed over the text in question. Thus the presence of the dialog box may force a user to hit the acknowledge button e.g. an affirmative action that is recordable by the system in order to read the underlying annotated text. In certain example embodiments only a portion of the text may be obscured. Alternatively all of the text may be obscured. Obscuring the text may be accomplished by placing the dialog box over the text or masking e.g. blurring the text of the document until the acknowledgement or other appropriate action is taken by the user. In other embodiments the text may be completely visible with the dialog box and associated features placed off to the side of the text. In certain example embodiments the dialog box may take up between 20 and 40 of the space on a given screen. In other embodiments the control or dialog box may take up the entire screen e.g. to force the user to acknowledge DDDI .

Continuing with an assigned item is presented to a user where the user may read the comments that have been included by the assignor in step . The assignee then acknowledges the item by hitting the acknowledge button in step . This action is recorded and saved by the system so that there is a record of the assignee acknowledging the item. In certain example embodiments the assignee may also include a response along with acknowledging.

However as the text of the annotated portion of the document is obscured it may be difficult for the assignee to provide any comments based on the contents of the annotated portions. Thus after the item is acknowledged the dialog box or other type of user interface control may be dismissed to allow the assignee to read the annotated portion in step and as shown in .

When the item is dismissed an icon may be placed on the screen to indicate that a DDDI is associated with this particular annotated portion of the document. After considering the annotated portion the assignee may open up the response tool to submit a textual response in addition to the earlier acknowledgement in step . An example opened response tool is shown in .

In certain example embodiments the assignee may see their own responses but not those from other users that are associated with the item. In certain examples the users may see all of the other users actions. In certain examples the content that is visible is based on who is viewing it. For example a manager may see the responses of all of his her subordinates.

With the response tool opened the assignee can now enter a response in step . The response is submitted and saved to the system in step . The text of the submitted text of the response is shown in . Also the original assignor is now notified that a response from the assignee has been entered in step . This notification can be an alert within the viewing application or may be an email or other communication to the original assignor.

The Custom Viewer then requests digital rights management DRM security permissions available for the requesting user in step C. In response to this request the server pulls data from the DRM Permissions Database and streams it to the user s computing resources that is running the document viewer via the Document DRM Streaming API in step D. In step E the Custom Viewer requests annotations e.g. associated dynamic due diligence items belonging to the user for display in the requested document. In response the server pulls this data from the Annotations database for annotations associated with the document in step F. The system also determines which DDDIs are associated with the requesting user for this document from the Dynamic Due Diligence Database in step G. Also in step H document version information may be retrieved to allow a particular version of a document to be shown to a user e.g. if there are multiple different versions of a document . All of this collected information is then sent hack to the document viewer e.g. via the Document Annotation Streaming API on the user s computing resource.

In step I the viewer requests a list of other users that due diligence items can be assigned. As discussed above this may be a list of users who are in the same department or group e.g. the information technology IT team . In step J the server system pulls the list of other users who also have access to view the document in question by making a call to the Document ACL API which queries the Core System Database. In step K the system cross references this data with specific rules available in the Dynamic Due Diligence database and streams the result to the viewer e.g. via the Document DynDueDiligence Streaming API .

It will be appreciated that the above communications between the viewer and document repository system may be synchronous calls that are implemented serially or may be asynchronous calls that are implemented in parallel or some combination thereof.

The user s computing resource running the viewer may then assemble the final document for view by the user by overlaying or otherwise combining integrating data that is associated with the requested document. In this regard is a flow chart of an example process for presenting a document to a user. In particular starting with transition step L the base contents of the document may be loaded in step M. This may include pages images etc. of the document. In step N DRM security restrictions watermarks hiding of specific pages or elements offline viewing rights expiration policy print restrictions etc. may be loaded by the viewer. In step P annotations DDDI information may be layered on top of the content of the pages of the document. To the user the resulting document may appear as one document e.g. the overlaying process may not be obvious or visible for a user of the document viewer . In step Q the Dynamic Due Diligence workflow tools are loaded. These tools may be loaded based on rules governing who and what methods of document assignment can be conducted within the specific document for the viewing user. Accordingly the loaded document and other associated information on annotations DDDI information is presented to the user in step .

Returning to and step after presentation of the document the user reviews the document in the Custom Viewer in step and sees a section of the document requiring Dynamic Due Diligence. Accordingly the user selects the annotation tool in the Custom Viewer and highlights a passage within the document in the Custom Viewer in step . The user then clicks a Dynamic Due Diligence Assign button in the Custom Viewer to create a DDDI item and finalizes it for use within the system in step .

Specifically the Custom Viewer first displays a Dynamic Due Diligence Assignment tool that allows a user to enter certain information related to the creation of a DDDI. The user is presented with a displayed list of users in step that the created DDDI may be assigned to. The assigning user selects one of the displayed users in step . Also the assigning user may prepare a comment that is to be a part of the newly created DDDI in step . For example the comment may be specific instructions for the assigned users on what they are to do for their due diligence review.

The created information is communicated described in more detail below to the server in step where it is stored in a database e.g. the Annotations Database shown in . It will be appreciated that one or more of the above steps may be optional. For example the assigning user may skip adding a comment to the created DDDI.

According to step the details of the sent DDDI include information on the annotation such as XY starting coordinates XY ending coordinates and Vector graphics details e.g. if the user specified the annotation via freehand drawing . In certain example embodiments the server receives this information via the Web Services application layer and the business logic layer routes this data to the Annotation Routing API.

In certain example embodiments in step the server may determine e.g. via the Annotation Routing API whether any two users are on different versions of the same document. If this situation occurs the server may then invoke the Annotation Extraction API which takes as input the details of the annotation and associated DDDI and returns a mapping of Document Version Numbers matching Page Numbers and matching start end XY coordinates in step .

In step the Annotation Routing API stores the annotation data in the Annotations Database and the Dynamic Due Diligence assignments in the Dynamic Due Diligence Database.

In step the Annotation Routing API invokes the User Notification API. This invocation may in turn cause the User Notification API to send an email to all recipients to whom the Dynamic Due Diligence item has been assigned. With the DDDI item stored in the server an assigned user may now respond to the contents via the example steps shown in e.g. via transition C .

At this point a Custom Viewer presentation tool is invoked on the user s PC or mobile device. As described herein the Custom Viewer requests assembles and renders a display of the document along with pertinent support structures in step .

The rendering of the display through the document viewer may include having the Custom Viewer request details of the specific annotations assigned to the user within the document regardless of the fact that such annotations were created by another user in another version of the document. Specifically the version of the document may play a role in how the annotation DDDI is displayed but may not hinder the DDDI from being displayed even if the document versions being worked on are different.

Also the Custom Viewer s Dynamic Due Diligence workflow tools receive information about the assigned Dynamic Due Diligence annotations. This information may include for example page or line numbers of the document that is associated with the annotation. This information may then allow for the overlaid information to be rendered in accordance with how the annotation was originally created.

Upon the opening the document in the Custom Viewer the Custom Viewer s Dynamic Due Diligence workflow tools alert the user in step that one or more Dynamic Due Diligence items require attention within the document. In certain example embodiments the alerts are clickable and direct to the user to each Dynamic Due Diligence item within the document with each click.

In step the Dynamic Due Diligence Assignment tool within the Custom Viewer appears as an overlay on top of each assigned annotation. The rendered information of the DDDI is placed over the top of the annotated portion in step . In certain example embodiments as described above the user must Acknowledge having seen the annotation in step . After acknowledgement the portion of the document that was obscured is revealed in step so that the user may review the portion in step .

In certain example embodiments either immediately on or after reviewing the assigned annotation and page contents the user can provide a supplemental response in the form of a text based response e.g. in addition to the acknowledgement response in step . For example the user may click on an icon to re display the workflow tool for the DDDI associated with a particular annotation. The user may then create a text based response that is to be reviewed by the original assignor or other users .

This updated information is then sent to the server in step . For example the Custom Viewer may send the Document ID AnnotationID the date of Acknowledgement and Response to the server. It will be appreciated that additional server updates may be performed in response to user actions. For example when the user acknowledges the DDDI a response may be sent before sending information on the supplemental response. In certain example embodiments updates may be sent when a document is closed out or at certain time based intervals e.g. every minute the document viewer information is synchronized with the server .

In any event in step the server receives the sent information via the Web Services application layer and and the business logic layer and routes the data to the Annotation Routing API. The Annotation Routing API then stores the Acknowledgment and Response in the Dynamic Due Diligence Database.

In step the Annotation Routing API invokes the User Notification API to notify relevant users of the updated DDDI information associated with this particular annotation. For example the original creator of the DDDI may receive an email regarding the acknowledgment and or updated response. It will be appreciated that such notifications may be configured based on the particular needs of a client. After notifying the creator the process may then transition via transition D to approving the status of a DDDI.

In the web services layer of the system as part of these checks a call is made to the DynDueDil Response API which pulls data from the Dynamic Due Diligence Database to determine when one or more assignees have Acknowledged and or responded to the Dynamic Due Diligence item. Such details are then streamed to the Custom Viewer via the Annotation Routing API.

Accordingly in the Viewer the Dynamic Due Diligence Assignment tool provides an updated status of a given Dynamic Due Diligence item showing the Dynamic Due Diligence item creator and for each assignee 1 the Acknowledgement Status Acknowledged Yes No and if Yes the date may be displayed in step and 2 the response if any typed in by the assignee in step .

Thus in certain example embodiments users may perform dynamic due diligence through use of workflows annotations and the like that are associated with a document or a piece of information or portion thereof that is electronically presented to the users.

A dynamic due diligence item may also be associated with a recommendation made by a user associated with the item e.g. the assignor or assignee . Also recommendations may take on two or more levels and such recommendations may be collated and presented to users of the system.

The techniques described herein may be implemented on computing systems e.g. processing systems that are composed of processors and other components of computer architecture.

The processing system may also include a network interface that may facilitate wired e.g. Ethernet or wireless communication WiFi 802.11x protocols cellular technology and the like with external systems or databases . External systems may include other processing systems systems that provide third party services etc. Here external systems may also be the client or server system. For example the processing system may implement functionality of a client system as described herein thus the external system may be the server system as described herein. Conversely the processing system may implement the server system and the external systems may include client systems. External systems may also include network attached storage NAS to hold large amounts of data e.g. thousands or millions of electronic documents . Such external systems for storage along with the internal storage and memory may form a storage system for storing and maintaining information e.g. documents that are the subject of a due diligence process. Such a system many communicate with user and respective computing resource e.g. a client system terminal etc to provide documents and information for review and consideration.

The databases may include relational object orientated or other types of databases for storing information e.g. such as annotations database in .

In other words the processes techniques and the like described herein may be implemented on a computing system. Such implementations may then configure or program the processing system to carry out aspects according to certain example embodiments.

In certain example embodiments a client system implementing a document viewer reader may be a special document viewer that is used to enforce certain policies on the end user as they read through and interact with the document. For example the reader may prevent users for locally saving copies of the document. In certain example embodiments the data that makes up the document that is being displayed may be encrypted when it is temporally stored within the memory of the user s computer system. Such techniques may assist in preventing users from copying data that is being presented through the viewer.

In certain example embodiments the viewer may have digital rights management DRM aspects that control how or what a user can do with a document. For example users may be barred from printing a displayed document. In certain instances local saves may be authorized but may be time based such that the local copies are no longer accessible after a certain period of time. In certain instances such triggers may be tied to when the person logs into out of the system. Thus local saving may be allowed for one or more sessions of work. In certain instances the saving of a local copy of the document may be more efficient e.g. if the document is many megabytes in size that re downloading the document contents each time the document is accessed. By saving the document locally annotation changes or other informational changes associated with the document may be streamed down separately to the client when such changes are saved to the server system e.g. when a new DDDI is created for an annotated portion of the document . Accordingly the viewer may dynamically integrate such changes into the document while it is being displayed on the fly.

In certain example embodiment watering marking techniques may be employed. In certain example embodiments the viewer and or system may track who has opened a particular document what pages have been presented how long a particular page was presented etc. Such information may be relevant in having a comprehensive log associated with the performance of due diligence. For example after a deal closes if a lawsuit is brought because of an allegation of non disclosure of particular facts associated with a deal the system may be able to provide information that user A viewed document X and page Y for Z minutes.

In certain example embodiments the client system may be network terminal that functions to output a display of the document but does not provide any significant processing power. In other words the rendering of the document and integration of the annotation and DDDI information may be performed by a server and then streamed for display on the client system. Of course other types of client systems may also interact with a server e.g. personal computers mobile devices etc .

In certain example embodiments assignee users may reroute assigned items to other users. For example one user ma not be qualified to answer a particular question associated with the annotated portion of a document. Thus the user may re route it to a specialist or may escalate to their manager who may then re route to an appropriate person . In certain example embodiments re routing or escalating may create new DDDIs with the particular annotation. Alternatively such re routing may be appended to an already existing DDDI. In certain example embodiments re routing a. DDDI may be an event that is recorded by the system e.g. that can be reported on in the future .

In certain example embodiments users may share annotated portions of a document with each other but without the requirement that the shared annotations be later acknowledged. 

In certain example embodiments a method for creating a workflow assignment for an individual s use of an electronic document management system EDMS is provided that comprises the steps of 1 identifying a specific portion of a specific document in the EDMS 2 Entering a specific set of instructions dictating exactly what action s need to be performed related to the relevant portion of the document 3 Identifying the individual user to whom this new workflow item is to be assigned 4 Notifying the individual that they have a new workflow assignment within the EDMS 5 Modifying the individual s view of the document in such a manner that they can simultaneously or sequentially but in any case contextually see the following a The specific portion of the document identified as needing their attention as per Step above b The instructions entered telling them what action s they must perform as per Step above c A user interface control element consisting of but not limited to a button a select list or a text box that the individual can use to change the status of the workflow assignment.

A further aspect is where the EDMS is specifically identified as belonging to the virtual data room subclass of document management systems implying that the assigned workflows are in relation to the act of performing due diligence on a company a financial transaction a regulatory approval or any other transaction typically performed within a virtual data room.

A further aspect is where the act of notifying the individual of the new workflow assignment consists of one of the following 1 Sending an email or other electronic message to the user 2 Displaying a notification on a page control or other graphical element within the EDMS.

A further aspect is where the notification exists within a specialized document viewer consisting of 1 A visible alert in a prominent area of the document viewer such as the primary toolbar which is visible on every page within the document and hence is difficult for the individual to overlook 2 A visible dialog or alert that appears before the user is able to navigate through the document or through a certain range of pages or range of content within the document.

A further aspect is where the alert shown to the individual can be acted upon to display additional information and or take action on the workflow assignment where such information and or actions consist of 1 Displaying a list of workflow assignments within the document 2 Displaying the page number and other relevant location details of each workflow assignment within the document 3 Navigating the user to a specific workflow assignment within the document 4 Navigating the user to each of a plurality of workflow assignments that exist within the document.

A further aspect is where the modification of the individual s view of the document identifies the specific portion of the document needing their attention through the use of a series of markers surrounding the relevant section of the document.

A further aspect is where the instructions telling the individual what action is needed from them appears as a box or dialog superimposed upon or side by side next to the specific portion of the document in such a manner that the individual can comprehend that the instructions are specifically referring to this identified portion of the document.

A further aspect is where the control accessible to the individual allows them to change the status of the workflow item to the following 1 Acknowledged 2 Acknowledge and Commented On where a text box allows for the individual to type comments back to the workflow assignment originator 3 Completed 4 Reassigned where the individual can select a different individual as the new Assignee or 5 in Progress where some other specific configurable workflow has been invoked corresponding to a workflow management system within the EDMS.

A further aspect is where each workflow assignment is comprised of 1 The Assignor 2 The Assignee s 3 The Date of Assignment 4 The Current Status of the Assignment.

A further aspect is where the list resides within a virtual data room subclass of electronic document management systems.

A further aspect is where a dynamic due diligence report is created where each workflow assignment in the report 1. Represents a due diligence action item that must be performed in order for due diligence to be deemed complete by the parties using the system 2 Represents a due diligence action item that did not exist at the onset of the due diligence process prior to the parties beginning their review of the plurality of due diligence documents within the system and 3 Represents a due diligence action item that is comprised of a portion of a document but not any document in its entirety.
