Current methods and systems for the detection of malware in a computer system e.g. the detection software viruses generally employ signature based detection through systems that search the computer software for data patterns that have previously been identified with malicious software. However since the number of known malicious data patterns can be very large searching a computer system for all known malicious data patterns can impair the computer s performance. Therefore there is need for methods and systems that are able to identify evidence of malware in a computer system without the need to search all possible malicious data patterns for all possible threats each time a computer system is scanned for malware.

This disclosure describes methods and systems for searching computer software for malware through the accumulated identification of threat characteristics for targeted computer objects e.g. run time processes that allows for the dynamic detection of complex threats in a way that scales with the number of threat descriptions and the number of system objects tracked.

In embodiments the present disclosure may provide a method of dynamic threat detection comprising a first database that correlates a plurality of threat characteristics to a threat wherein a presence of the plurality of the threat characteristics confirms a presence of the threat detecting a change event in a computer run time process testing the change event for a presence of one or more of the plurality of characteristics upon detection of the change event storing a detection of one of the plurality of characteristics in a second database that accumulates detected characteristics for the computer run time process and identifying the threat when each one of the plurality of characteristics appears in the second database. The threat may include a malware threat to a computer facility or any other like threat such as listed herein. The threat may include a violation of an enterprise security policy. The plurality of characteristics may include a plurality of code functionality a property of a program and like such as referred to herein as genes . The run time process may include at least one of an access to a file a process a mutual exclusion object a registry key and the like. The second database may accumulate detected characteristics for each of a plurality of computer run time processes. The first database may correlate a different plurality of characteristics to each one of a plurality of different threats. The disclosure may provide for creating a new threat characteristic for inclusion into the database when the detected change event is identified as a threat by a threat identification facility but is not currently in the database.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

While the invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments other embodiments would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed herein.

It should be understood that the threat management facility may provide multiple services and policy management may be offered as one of the services. We will now turn to a description of certain capabilities and components of the threat management system .

Over recent years malware has become a major problem across the internet . From both technical and user perspectives the categorization of a specific threat type whether as virus worm spam phishing exploration spyware adware or the like is becoming reduced in significance. The threat no matter how it is categorized may need to be stopped at various points of a networked computing environment such as one of an enterprise facility including at one or more laptops desktops servers gateways communication ports handheld or mobile devices firewalls and the like. Similarly there may be less and less benefit to the user in having different solutions for known and unknown threats. As such a consolidated threat management facility may need to apply a similar set of technologies and capabilities for all threats. In certain embodiments the threat management facility may provide a single agent on the desktop and a single scan of any suspect file. This approach may eliminate the inevitable overlaps and gaps in protection caused by treating viruses and spyware as separate problems while simultaneously simplifying administration and minimizing desktop load. As the number and range of types of threats has increased so may have the level of connectivity available to all IT users. This may have lead to a rapid increase in the speed at which threats may move. Today an unprotected PC connected to the internet may be infected quickly perhaps within 10 minutes which may require acceleration for the delivery of threat protection. Where once monthly updates may have been sufficient the threat management facility may automatically and seamlessly update its product set against spam and virus threats quickly for instance every five minutes every minute continuously or the like. Analysis and testing may be increasingly automated and also may be performed more frequently for instance it may be completed in 15 minutes and may do so without compromising quality. The threat management facility may also extend techniques that may have been developed for virus and malware protection and provide them to enterprise facility network administrators to better control their environments. In addition to stopping malicious code the threat management facility may provide policy management that may be able to control legitimate applications such as VoIP instant messaging peer to peer file sharing and the like that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility .

The threat management facility may provide an enterprise facility protection from computer based malware including viruses spyware adware Trojans intrusion spam policy abuse uncontrolled access and the like where the enterprise facility may be any entity with a networked computer based infrastructure. In an embodiment may depict a block diagram of the threat management facility providing protection to an enterprise against a plurality of threats. The enterprise facility may be corporate commercial educational governmental or the like and the enterprise facility s computer network may be distributed amongst a plurality of facilities and in a plurality of geographical locations and may include administration a firewall A an appliance A server A network devices A B clients A D such as protected by computer security facilities and the like. The threat management facility may include a plurality of functions such as security management facility policy management facility update facility definitions facility network access rules facility remedial action facility detection techniques facility testing facility threat research facility and the like. In embodiments the threat protection provided by the threat management facility may extend beyond the network boundaries of the enterprise facility to include client facilities D that have moved into network connectivity not directly associated or controlled by the enterprise facility . Threats to client facilities may come from a plurality of sources such as from network threats physical proximity threats secondary location threats and the like. Clients may be protected from threats even when the client is not located in association with the enterprise such as when a client E F moves in and out of the enterprise such as interfacing with an unprotected server C through the Internet when a client F is moving into a secondary location threat such as interfacing with components B B C D that are not protected and the like. In embodiments the threat management facility may provide an enterprise facility protection from a plurality of threats to multiplatform computer resources in a plurality of locations and network configurations with an integrated system approach.

In embodiments the threat management facility may be provided as a stand alone solution. In other embodiments the threat management facility may be integrated into a third party product. An application programming interface e.g. a source code interface may be provided such that the threat management facility may be integrated. For instance the threat management facility may be stand alone in that it provides direct threat protection to an enterprise or computer resource where protection is subscribed to directly . Alternatively the threat management facility may offer protection indirectly through a third party product where an enterprise may subscribe to services through the third party product and threat protection to the enterprise may be provided by the threat management facility through the third party product.

The security management facility may include a plurality of elements that provide protection from malware to enterprise facility computer resources including endpoint security and control email security and control web security and control reputation based filtering control of unauthorized users control of guest and non compliant computers and the like. The security management facility may be a software application that may provide malicious code and malicious application protection to a client facility computing resource. The security management facility may have the ability to scan the client facility files for malicious code remove or quarantine certain applications and files prevent certain actions perform remedial actions and perform other security measures. In embodiments scanning the client facility may include scanning some or all of the files stored to the client facility on a periodic basis may scan applications once the application has been requested to execute may scan files as the files are transmitted to or from the client facility or the like. The scanning of the applications and files may be to detect known malicious code or known unwanted applications. In an embodiment new malicious code and unwanted applications may be continually developed and distributed and updates to the known code database may be provided on a periodic basis on a demand basis on an alert basis or the like.

Web security and control may provide internet use policies reporting on suspect devices security and content filtering active monitoring of network traffic URI filtering and the like. In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for network access control which may provide control over network connections. Network control may stop unauthorized guest or non compliant systems from accessing networks and may control network traffic that may not be bypassed from the client level. In addition network access control may control access to virtual private networks VPN where VPNs may be a communications network tunneled through another network establishing a logical connection acting as a virtual network. In embodiments a VPN may be treated in the same manner as a physical network.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for host intrusion prevention through behavioral based protection which may guard against unknown threats by analyzing behavior before software code executes. Behavioral based protection may monitor code when it runs and intervene if the code is deemed to be suspicious or malicious. Advantages of behavioral based protection over runtime protection may include code being prevented from running whereas runtime protection may only interrupt code that has already partly executed behavioral protection may identify malicious code at the gateway or on the file servers and deletes it before reaching end point computers and the like.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for reputation filtering which may target or identify sources of known malware. For instance reputation filtering may include lists of URIs of known sources of malware or known suspicious IP addresses or domains say for spam that when detected may invoke an action by the threat management facility such as dropping them immediately. By dropping the source before any interaction can initiate potential threat sources may be thwarted before any exchange of data can be made.

In embodiments information may be sent from the enterprise back to a third party a vendor or the like which may lead to improved performance of the threat management facility . For example the types times and number of virus interactions that a client experiences may provide useful information for the preventions of future virus threats. This type of feedback may be useful for any aspect of threat detection. Feedback of information may also be associated with behaviors of individuals within the enterprise such as being associated with most common violations of policy network access unauthorized application loading unauthorized external device use and the like. In embodiments this type of information feedback may enable the evaluation or profiling of client actions that are violations of policy that may provide a predictive model for the improvement of enterprise policies.

In an embodiment the security management facility may provide for the overall security of the enterprise facility network or set of enterprise facility networks may provide updates of malicious code information to the enterprise facility network and associated client facilities . The updates may be a planned update an update in reaction to a threat notice an update in reaction to a request for an update an update based on a search of known malicious code information or the like. The administration facility may provide control over the security management facility when updates are performed. The updates may be automatically transmitted without an administration facility s direct control manually transmitted by the administration facility or the like. The security management facility may include the management of receiving malicious code descriptions from a provider distribution of malicious code descriptions to enterprise facility networks distribution of malicious code descriptions to client facilities or the like. In an embodiment the management of malicious code information may be provided to the enterprise facility s network where the enterprise facility s network may provide the malicious code information through the enterprise facility s network distribution system.

The threat management facility may provide a policy management facility that may be able to block non malicious applications such as VoIP instant messaging peer to peer file sharing and the like that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility . The policy management facility may be a set of rules or policies that may indicate enterprise facility access permissions for the client facility such as access permissions associated with the network applications external computer devices and the like. The policy management facility may include a database a text file a combination of databases and text files or the like. In an embodiment a policy database may be a block list a black list an allowed list a white list or the like that may provide a list of enterprise facility external network locations applications that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . The policy management facility may include rules that may be interpreted with respect to an enterprise facility network access request to determine if the request should be allowed. The rules may provide a generic rule for the type of access that may be granted the rules may be related to the policies of an enterprise facility for access rights for the enterprise facility s client facility . For example there may be a rule that does not permit access to sporting websites. When a website is requested by the client facility a security facility may access the rules within a policy facility to determine if the requested access is related to a sporting website. In an embodiment the security facility may analyze the requested website to determine if the website matches with any of the policy facility rules.

The policy management facility may be similar to the security management facility but with the addition of enterprise facility wide access rules and policies that may be distributed to maintain control of client facility access to enterprise facility network resources. The policies may be defined for application type subset of application capabilities organization hierarchy computer facility type user type network location time of day connection type or the like. Policies may be maintained by the administration facility through the threat management facility in association with a third party or the like. For example a policy may restrict IM activity to only support personnel for communicating with customers. This may allow communication for departments requiring access but may maintain the network bandwidth for other activities by restricting the use of IM to only the personnel that need access to IM in support of the enterprise facility . In an embodiment the policy management facility may be a stand alone application may be part of the network server facility may be part of the enterprise facility network may be part of the client facility or the like.

In embodiments the threat management facility may provide configuration management which may be similar to policy management but may specifically examine the configuration set of applications operating systems hardware and the like and managing changes to their configurations. Assessment of a configuration may be made against a standard configuration policy detection of configuration changes remediation of improper configuration application of new configurations and the like. An enterprise may keep a set of standard configuration rules and policies which may represent the desired state of the device. For example a client firewall may be running and installed but in the disabled state where remediation may be to enable the firewall. In another example the enterprise may set a rule that disallows the use of USB disks and sends a configuration change to all clients which turns off USB drive access via a registry.

In embodiments the threat management facility may also provide for the removal of applications that may interfere with the operation of the threat management facility such as competitor products that may also be attempting similar threat management functions. The removal of such products may be initiated automatically whenever such products are detected. In the case where such applications are services are provided indirectly through a third party product the application may be suspended until action is taken to remove or disable the third party product s protection facility.

Threat management against a sometimes quickly evolving malware environment may require timely updates and the update management facility may be provided by the threat management facility . In addition a policy management facility may also require update management e.g. as provided by the update facility herein described as the enterprise facility requirements for policies change enterprise facility client facility server facility enterprise facility . The update management for the security facility and policy management facility may be provided directly by the threat management facility such as by a hosted system or in conjunction with the administration facility . In embodiments the threat management facility may provide for patch management where a patch may be an update to an operating system an application a system tool or the like where one of the reasons for the patch is to reduce vulnerability to threats.

In embodiments the security facility and policy management facility may push information to the enterprise facility network and or client facility the enterprise facility network and or client facility may pull information from the security facility and policy management facility network server facilities there may be a combination of pushing and pulling of information between the security facility and the policy management facility network servers enterprise facility network and client facilities or the like. For example the enterprise facility network and or client facility may pull information from the security facility and policy management facility network server facility may request the information using the security facility and policy management facility update module the request may be based on a certain time period by a certain time by a date on demand or the like. In another example the security facility and policy management facility network servers may push the information to the enterprise facility s network and or client facility by providing notification that there are updates available for download and then transmitting the information. The combination of the security management network server facility and security update module may function substantially the same as the policy management facility network server and policy update module by providing information to the enterprise facility network and the client facility in a push or pull method. In an embodiment the policy management facility and the security facility management update modules may work in concert to provide all the needed information to the enterprise facility s network and or client facility for control of application execution. In an embodiment the policy update module and security update module may be combined into a single update module.

As threats are identified and characterized the threat management facility may create definition updates that may be used to allow the threat management facility to detect and remediate the latest malicious software unwanted applications configuration and policy changes and the like. The threat definition facility may contain threat identification updates also referred to as definition files. A definition file may be a virus identity file that may include definitions of known or potential malicious code. The virus identity IDE definition files may provide information that may identify malicious code within files applications or the like. The definition files may be accessed by security management facility when scanning files or applications within the client facility for the determination of malicious code that may be within the file or application. The definition files may contain a number of commands definitions or instructions to be parsed and acted upon or the like. In embodiments the client facility may be updated with new definition files periodically to provide the client facility with the most recent malicious code definitions the updating may be performed on a set time period may be updated on demand from the client facility may be updated on demand from the network may be updated on a received malicious code alert or the like. In an embodiment the client facility may request an update to the definition files from an update facility within the network may request updated definition files from a computing facility external to the network updated definition files may be provided to the client facility from within the network definition files may be provided to the client facility from an external computing facility from an external network or the like.

In an embodiment a definition management facility may provide for the timely updates of definition files information to the network client facilities and the like. New and altered malicious code and malicious applications may be continually created and distributed to networks worldwide. The definition files that maintain the definitions of the malicious code and malicious application information for the protection of the networks and client facilities may need continual updating to provide continual defense of the network and client facility from the malicious code and malicious applications. The definition files management may provide for automatic and manual methods of updating the definition files. In embodiments the network may receive definition files and distribute the definition files to the network client facilities the client facilities may receive the definition files directly or the network and client facilities may both receive the definition files or the like. In an embodiment the definition files may be updated on a fixed periodic basis on demand by the network and or the client facility as a result of an alert of a new malicious code or malicious application or the like. In an embodiment the definition files may be released as a supplemental file to an existing definition files to provide for rapid updating of the definition files.

In a similar manner the security management facility may be used to scan an outgoing file and verify that the outgoing file is permitted to be transmitted per the enterprise facility rules and policies. By checking outgoing files the security management facility may be able discover malicious code infected files that were not detected as incoming files as a result of the client facility having been updated with either new definition files or policy management facility information. The definition files may discover the malicious code infected file by having received updates of developing malicious code from the administration facility updates from a definition files provider or the like. The policy management facility may discover the malicious code infected file by having received new updates from the administration facility from a rules provider or the like.

The threat management facility may provide for a way to control access to the enterprise facility networks. For instance the enterprise facility may want to restrict access to certain applications networks files printers servers databases or the like. In addition the enterprise facility may want to restrict user access under certain conditions such as the user s location usage history need to know job position connection type time of day method of authentication client system configuration or the like. Network access rules may be developed by the enterprise facility or pre packaged by a supplier and managed by the threat management facility in conjunction with the administration facility . Network access rules and control may be responsible for determining if a client facility application should be granted access to a requested network location. The network location may be on the same network as the facility or may be on another network. In an embodiment the network access control may verify access rights for client facilities from within the network or may verify access rights of computer facilities from external networks. When network access for a client facility is denied the network access control may send an information file to the client facility the information file may contain data or commands that may provide instructions for the remedial action facility . The information sent by the network access facility control may be a data file. The data file may contain a number of commands definitions instructions or commands to be parsed and acted upon through the remedial action facility or the like. The information sent by the network access facility control may be a command or command file that the remedial action facility may access and take action upon.

In an embodiment the network access rules may provide an information store to be accessed by the network access control. The network access rules facility may include databases such as a block list a black list an allowed list a white list an unacceptable network site database an acceptable network site database a network site reputation database or the like of network access locations that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . Additionally the network access rules facility may incorporate rule evaluation the rule evaluation may parse network access requests and apply the parsed information to network access rules. The network access rule facility may have a generic set of rules that may be in support of an enterprise facility s network access policies such as denying access to certain types of websites controlling instant messenger accesses or the like. Rule evaluation may include regular expression rule evaluation or other rule evaluation method for interpreting the network access request and comparing the interpretation to the established rules for network access. In an embodiment the network access rules facility may receive a rules evaluation request from the network access control and may return the rules evaluation to the network access control.

Similar to the threat definitions facility the network access rule facility may provide updated rules and policies to the enterprise facility . The network access rules facility may be maintained by the network administration facility using network access rules facility management. In an embodiment the network administration facility may be able to maintain a set of access rules manually by adding rules changing rules deleting rules or the like. Additionally the administration facility may be able to retrieve predefined rule sets from a provider that may provide a set of rules to be applied to an entire enterprise facility . The network administration facility may be able to modify the predefined rules as needed for a particular enterprise facility using the network access rules management facility .

When a threat or policy violation is detected by the threat management facility the threat management facility may provide for a remedial action facility . Remedial action may take a plurality of forms such as terminating or modifying an ongoing process or interaction sending a warning to a client or administration facility of an ongoing process or interaction executing a program or application to remediate against a threat or violation record interactions for subsequent evaluation or the like. Remedial action may be associated with an application that responds to information that a client facility network access request has been denied. In an embodiment when the data file is received remedial action may parse the data file interpret the various aspects of the data file and act on the parsed data file information to determine actions to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment when the data file is received remedial action may access the threat definitions to parse the data file and determine an action to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment the information received from the facility may be a command or a command file. The remedial action facility may carry out any commands that are received or parsed from a data file from the facility without performing any interpretation of the commands. In an embodiment the remedial action facility may interact with the received information and may perform various actions on a client requesting access to a denied network location. The action may be one or more of continuing to block all requests to a denied network location a malicious code scan on the application a malicious code scan on the client facility quarantine of the application terminating the application isolation of the application isolation of the client facility to a location within the network that restricts network access blocking a network access port from a client facility reporting the application to a administration facility or the like.

Remedial action may be provided as a result of a detection of a threat or violation. The detection techniques facility may include monitoring the enterprise facility network or end point devices such as by monitoring streaming data through the gateway across the network through routers and hubs and the like. The detection techniques facility may include monitoring activity and stored files on computing facilities such as on server facilities desktop computers laptop computers other mobile computing devices and the like. Detection techniques such as scanning a computer s stored files may provide the capability of checking files for stored threats either in the active or passive state. Detection techniques such as streaming file management may provide the capability of checking files received at the network gateway facility client facility and the like. This may provide the capability of not allowing a streaming file or portions of the streaming file containing malicious code from entering the client facility gateway facility or network. In an embodiment the streaming file may be broken into blocks of information and a plurality of virus identities may be used to check each of the blocks of information for malicious code. In an embodiment any blocks that are not determined to be clear of malicious code may not be delivered to the client facility gateway facility or network.

Verifying that the threat management facility is detecting threats and violations to established policy may require the ability to test the system either at the system level or for a particular computing component. The testing facility may allow the administration facility to coordinate the testing of the security configurations of client facility computing facilities on a network. The administration facility may be able to send test files to a set of client facility computing facilities to test the ability of the client facility to determine acceptability of the test file. After the test file has been transmitted a recording facility may record the actions taken by the client facility in reaction to the test file. The recording facility may aggregate the testing information from the client facility and report the testing information to the administration facility . The administration facility may be able to determine the level of preparedness of the client facility computing facilities by the reported information. Remedial action may be taken for any of the client facility computing facilities as determined by the administration facility remedial action may be taken by the administration facility or by the user of the client facility .

The threat research facility may provide a continuously ongoing effort to maintain the threat protection capabilities of the threat management facility in light of continuous generation of new or evolved forms of malware. Threat research may include researchers and analysts working on known and emerging malware such as viruses rootkits a spyware as well as other computer threats such as phishing spam scams and the like. In embodiments through threat research the threat management facility may be able to provide swift global responses to the latest threats.

The threat management facility may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility where the enterprise facility may include a plurality of networked components such as client facility server facility administration facility firewall gateway hubs and routers threat management appliance desktop users mobile users and the like. In embodiments it may be the end point computer security facility located on a computer s desktop which may provide threat protection to a user and associated enterprise facility . In embodiments the term end point may refer to a computer system that may source data receive data evaluate data buffer data or the like such as a user s desktop computer as an end point computer a firewall as a data evaluation end point computer system a laptop as a mobile end point computer a PDA as a hand held end point computer a mobile phone as an end point computer or the like. In embodiments end point may refer to a source or destination for data including such components where the destination is characterized by an evaluation point for data and where the data may be sent to a subsequent destination after evaluation. The end point computer security facility may be an application loaded onto the computer platform or computer support component where the application may accommodate the plurality of computer platforms and or functional requirements of the component. For instance a client facility computer may be one of a plurality of computer platforms such as Windows Macintosh Linux and the like where the end point computer security facility may be adapted to the specific platform while maintaining a uniform product and product services across platforms. Additionally components may have different functions to serve within the enterprise facility s networked computer based infrastructure. For instance computer support components provided as hubs and routers server facility firewalls and the like may require unique security application software to protect their portion of the system infrastructure while providing an element in an integrated threat management system that extends out beyond the threat management facility to incorporate all computer resources under its protection.

The enterprise facility may include a plurality of client facility computing platforms on which the end point computer security facility is adapted. A client facility computing platform may be a computer system that is able to access a service on another computer such as a server facility via a network. This client facility server facility model may apply to a plurality of networked applications such as a client facility connecting to an enterprise facility application server facility a web browser client facility connecting to a web server facility an e mail client facility retrieving e mail from an internet service provider s mail storage servers and the like. In embodiments traditional large client facility applications may be switched to websites which may increase the browser s role as a client facility . Clients may be classified as a function of the extent to which they perform their own processing. For instance client facilities are sometimes classified as a fat client facility or thin client facility . The fat client facility also known as a thick client facility or rich client facility may be a client facility that performs the bulk of data processing operations itself and does not necessarily rely on the server facility . The fat client facility may be most common in the form of a personal computer where the personal computer may operate independent of any server facility . Programming environments for fat clients may include CURI Delphi Droplets Java win32 X11 and the like. Thin clients may offer minimal processing capabilities for instance the thin client facility may primarily provide a graphical user interface provided by an application server facility which may perform the bulk of any required data processing. Programming environments for thin clients may include JavaScript AJAX ASP JSP Ruby on Rails Python s Django PHP and the like. The client facility may also be a mix of the two such as processing data locally but relying on a server facility for data storage. As a result this hybrid client facility may provide benefits from both the fat client facility type such as multimedia support and high performance and the thin client facility type such as high manageability and flexibility. In embodiments the threat management facility and associated end point computer security facility may provide seamless threat protection to the plurality of clients and client facility types across the enterprise facility .

The enterprise facility may include a plurality of server facilities such as application servers communications servers file servers database servers proxy servers mail servers fax servers game servers web servers and the like. A server facility which may also be referred to as a server facility application server facility operating system server facility computer or the like may be an application program or operating system that accepts client facility connections in order to service requests from clients . The server facility application may run on the same computer as the client facility using it or the server facility and the client facility may be running on different computers and communicating across the network. Server facility applications may be divided among server facility computers with the dividing depending upon the workload. For instance under light load conditions all server facility applications may run on a single computer and under heavy load conditions a single server facility application may run on multiple computers. In embodiments the threat management facility may provide threat protection to server facilities within the enterprise facility as load conditions and application changes are made.

A server facility may also be an appliance facility where the appliance facility provides specific services onto the network. Though the appliance facility is a server facility computer that may be loaded with a server facility operating system and server facility application the enterprise facility user may not need to configure it as the configuration may have been performed by a third party. In an embodiment an enterprise facility appliance may be a server facility appliance that has been configured and adapted for use with the threat management facility and located within the facilities of the enterprise facility . The enterprise facility s threat management appliance may enable the enterprise facility to administer an on site local managed threat protection configuration where the administration facility may access the threat resources through an interface such as a web portal. In an alternate embodiment the enterprise facility may be managed remotely from a third party vendor or the like without an appliance facility located within the enterprise facility . In this instance the appliance functionality may be a shared hardware product between pluralities of enterprises . In embodiments the appliance facility may be located at the enterprise facility where the enterprise facility maintains a degree of control. In embodiments a hosted service may be provided where the appliance may still be an on site black box to the enterprise facility physically placed there because of infrastructure requirements but managed by a third party vendor or the like.

Simple server facility appliances may also be utilized across the enterprise facility s network infrastructure such as switches routers wireless routers hubs and routers gateways print servers net modems and the like. These simple server facility appliances may not require configuration by the enterprise facility but may require protection from threats via an end point computer security facility . These appliances may provide interconnection services within the enterprise facility network and therefore may advance the spread of a threat if not properly protected.

One way for a client facility to be protected from threats from within the enterprise facility network may be a personal firewall. A personal firewall may be an application that controls network traffic to and from a client permitting or denying communications based on a security policy. Personal firewalls may be designed for use by end users which may result in protection for only the computer on which it s installed. Personal firewalls may be able to control network traffic by providing prompts each time a connection is attempted and adapting security policy accordingly. Personal firewalls may also provide some level of intrusion detection which may allow the software to terminate or block connectivity where it suspects an intrusion is being attempted. Other features that may be provided by a personal firewall may include alerts about outgoing connection attempts control of program access to networks hiding the client from port scans by not responding to unsolicited network traffic monitoring of applications that may be listening for incoming connections monitoring and regulation of incoming and outgoing network traffic prevention of unwanted network traffic from installed applications reporting applications that make connection attempts reporting destination servers with which applications may be attempting communications and the like. In embodiments the personal firewall may be provided by the threat management facility .

Another important component that may be protected by an end point computer security facility is a network firewall facility which may be a hardware or software device that may be configured to permit deny or proxy data through a computer network that has different levels of trust in its source of data. For instance an internal enterprise facility network may have a high level of trust because the source of all data has been sourced from within the enterprise facility . An example of a low level of trust is the Internet because the source of data may be unknown. A zone with an intermediate trust level situated between the Internet and a trusted internal network may be referred to as a perimeter network . Since firewall facilities represent boundaries between threat levels the end point computer security facility associated with the firewall facility may provide resources that may control the flow of threats at this enterprise facility network entry point. Firewall facilities and associated end point computer security facility may also be associated with a network node that may be equipped for interfacing between networks that use different protocols. In embodiments the end point computer security facility may provide threat protection in a plurality of network infrastructure locations such as at the enterprise facility network entry point i.e. the firewall facility or gateway at the server facility at distribution points within the network i.e. the hubs and routers at the desktop of client facility computers and the like. In embodiments the most effective location for threat detection may be at the user s computer desktop end point computer security facility .

The interface between the threat management facility and the enterprise facility and through the appliance facility to embedded end point computer security facilities may include a set of tools that may be the same for all enterprise implementations but allow each enterprise to implement different controls. In embodiments these controls may include both automatic actions and managed actions. Automatic actions may include downloads of the end point computer security facility to components of the enterprise facility downloads of updates to existing end point computer security facilities of the enterprise facility uploaded network interaction requests from enterprise facility components to the threat management facility and the like. In embodiments automatic interactions between the enterprise facility and the threat management facility may be configured by the threat management facility and an administration facility in the enterprise facility . The administration facility may configure policy rules that determine interactions such as developing rules for accessing applications as in who is authorized and when applications may be used establishing rules for ethical behavior and activities rules governing the use of entertainment software such as games or personal use software such as IM and VoIP rules for determining access to enterprise facility computing resources including authentication levels of access risk assessment and usage history tracking rules for when an action is not allowed such as whether an action is completely deigned or just modified in its execution and the like. The administration facility may also establish license management which in turn may further determine interactions associated with a licensed application. In embodiments interactions between the threat management facility and the enterprise facility may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility by managing the flow of network data into and out of the enterprise facility through automatic actions that may be configured by the threat management facility or the administration facility .

Client facilities within the enterprise facility may be connected to the enterprise facility network by way of wired network facilities A or wireless network facilities B. Client facilities connected to the enterprise facility network via a wired facility A or wireless facility B may receive similar protection as both connection types are ultimately connected to the same enterprise facility network with the same end point computer security facility and the same threat protected enterprise facility environment. Mobile wireless facility clients B F because of their ability to connect to any wireless B D network access point may connect to the Internet outside the enterprise facility and therefore outside the threat protected environment of the enterprise facility . In this instance the mobile client facility B F if not for the presence of the end point computer security facility may experience a malware attack or perform actions counter to enterprise facility established policies. In addition there may be a plurality of ways for the threat management facility to protect the out of enterprise facility mobile client facility D F that has an embedded end point computer security facility such as by providing URI filtering in personal routers using a web appliance as a DNS proxy or the like. Mobile client facilities D F that are components of the enterprise facility but temporarily outside connectivity with the enterprise facility network may be provided with the same threat protection and policy control as client facilities inside the enterprise facility . In addition mobile client facilities B F may receive the same interactions to and from the threat management facility as client facilities inside the enterprise facility where mobile client facilities B F may be considered a virtual extension of the enterprise facility receiving all the same services via their embedded end point computer security facility .

Interactions between the threat management facility and the components of the enterprise facility including mobile client facility B F extensions of the enterprise facility may ultimately be connected through the internet . Threat management facility downloads and upgrades to the enterprise facility may be passed from the firewalled networks of the threat management facility through to the end point computer security facility equipped components of the enterprise facility . In turn the end point computer security facility components of the enterprise facility may upload policy and access requests back across the internet and through to the threat management facility . The Internet however is also the path through which threats may be transmitted from their source. These network threats may include threats from a plurality of sources including websites e mail IM VoIP application software and the like. These threats may attempt to attack a mobile enterprise client facility B F equipped with an end point computer security facility but in embodiments as long as the mobile client facility B F is embedded with an end point computer security facility as described above threats may have no better success than if the mobile client facility B F were inside the enterprise facility .

However if the mobile client facility were to attempt to connect into an unprotected connection point such as at a secondary location that is not a part of the enterprise facility the mobile client facility may be required to request network interactions through the threat management facility where contacting the threat management facility may be performed prior to any other network action. In embodiments the client facility s end point computer security facility may manage actions in unprotected network environments such as when the client facility F is in a secondary location or connecting wirelessly to a non enterprise facility wireless internet connection where the end point computer security facility may dictate what actions are allowed blocked modified or the like. For instance if the client facility s end point computer security facility is unable to establish a secured connection to the threat management facility the end point computer security facility may inform the user of such and recommend that the connection not be made. In the instance when the user chooses to connect despite the recommendation the end point computer security facility may perform specific actions during or after the unprotected connection is made including running scans during the connection period running scans after the connection is terminated storing interactions for subsequent threat and policy evaluation contacting the threat management facility upon first instance of a secured connection for further actions and or scanning restricting access to network and local resources or the like. In embodiments the end point computer security facility may perform specific actions to remediate possible threat incursions or policy violations during or after the unprotected connection.

The secondary location may have no end point computer security facilities as a part of its computer components such as its firewalls B servers B clients G hubs and routers C D and the like. As a result the computer components of the secondary location may be open to threat attacks and become potential sources of threats as well as any mobile enterprise facility clients B F that may be connected to the secondary location s network. In this instance these computer components may now unknowingly spread a threat to other components connected to the network.

Some threats may not come directly from the Internet such as from non enterprise facility controlled mobile devices that are physically brought into the enterprise facility and connected to the enterprise facility client facilities . The connection may be made from direct connection with the enterprise facility s client facility such as through a USB port or in physical proximity with the enterprise facility s client facility such that a wireless facility connection can be established such as through a Bluetooth connection. These physical proximity threats may be another mobile computing device a portable memory storage device a mobile communications device or the like such as CDs and DVDs memory stick flash drive external hard drive cell phone PDAs MP3 players digital cameras point to point devices digital picture frames digital pens navigation devices appliances and the like. A physical proximity threat may have been previously infiltrated by network threats while connected to an unprotected network connection outside the enterprise facility and when connected to the enterprise facility client facility pose a threat. Because of their mobile nature physical proximity threats may infiltrate computing resources in any location such as being physically brought into the enterprise facility site connected to an enterprise facility client facility while that client facility is mobile plugged into an unprotected client facility at a secondary location and the like. A mobile device once connected to an unprotected computer resource may become a physical proximity threat . In embodiments the end point computer security facility may provide enterprise facility computing resources with threat protection against physical proximity threats for instance through scanning the device prior to allowing data transfers through security validation certificates through establishing a safe zone within the enterprise facility computing resource to transfer data into for evaluation and the like.

Now that the overall system has been described we turn towards a set of threat detection embodiments utilizing the accumulated detection of threat characteristics. It should be understood that the following embodiments may be managed through a threat management facility along with other services such as those described herein.

Referring to a system diagram embodiment of a threat detection technique is depicted where the technique utilizes the accumulation of threat detection characteristics in identifying a threat to a computing device such as one of the threats listed herein. In traditional on access malware detection every on access scan runs through a full set of threat characteristic identities also referred to herein as gene identities and then runs threat describing identities one by one. A threat characteristic or gene may be a code strand functionality property and the like piece of information collected on system objects that may be reused and combined in different threat detections. A threat may be identified by the presence of a particular set of genes that are indicative of the threat. The traditional approach is very sequential where an on access scan is triggered after any target computing device object changes and the system recalculates all the genes and checks all the threat descriptions to find out whether any given threat is active. This approach to threat identification is very inefficient and does not scale with the number of genes or threat descriptions. For instance calculating all the genes in each on access scan includes genes that are likely to not be relevant to the potential of a particular threat threat environment computing platform application and the like and running threat identities sequentially fails to preserve knowledge between identities.

In the present disclosure a threat detection facility is provided that allows dynamic detection of complex threats in a way that scales linearly with the number of threat descriptions and the number of computer system objects tracked. The threat detection facility may provide an algorithm to detect threats in a dynamic detection environment where threats are described as a list of threat characteristics e.g. genes that must be present and where the threat characteristics may be generated detected dynamically through behavioral detection. The threat detection facility may allow for the tracking of all known threats efficiently and only recalculate genes that may potentially provide new information. Through this process processing may be kept to a minimum allowing increased efficiency. The invention may provide for a scalable solution that is able to cope with a large number of threat descriptions. Benefits of the threat detection facility may include stopping threats earlier in the detection process an increase in the performance of the target computing device through decreased processing requirements from scanning reduced memory usage and the like all of which may be especially important in mobile and virtualization applications.

Referring again to the threat detection facility may be resident in or interfacing with a computing device such as a client A a wireless client B a server A a firewall A a gateway and the like such as in part of a computer security facility in association with the computing device as described herein. The computing device may include an operating system running a plurality of run time processes as computer system objects such as files processes registry keys and the like. The threat detection facility may monitor capture filter and the like system events on the computer objects through event capture functionality. For instance a system event may be a change to a system process that is run by the operating system e.g. FileOpen FileWrite RegistryWrite and the like . The detection of the event may then initiate a process that generates a list of threat characteristics associated with the object that has experienced the event where a threat characteristics detector produces the list. In embodiments an anti virus engine may provide the functionality of the threat characteristics detector . The list of threat characteristics associated with the event may then be passed to a threat detection analyzer for creation of or insertion into threat tables that keep an accumulated record of threat characteristics that have been associated with events to objects over time where there may be a separate threat table for each object that has experienced an event. A threat analyzer then monitors the content of each threat table to see if the accumulated set of threat characteristics detected in events of a particular object match a threat index that lists what threat characteristics constitute a given threat.

In an example and referring to the example threat index of Table 1 a threat T1 may be comprised of genes G1 G2 and G3 . That is when genes G1 G2 and G3 are detected in the same computer object by the threat analyzer the threat analyzer will have determined that the threat T1 has been detected in the object. In embodiments the threat analyzer may then update a threat status such as with a list of identified threats a clean system status and the like.

A detailed example of how the threat characteristics analyzer generates and maintains threat tables and finally how the threat analyzer identifies the presence of a threat will now be presented. This example is meant to be illustrative of the process for detection of a threat using the threat detection facility and is not meant to be limiting in any way including the use of the term gene to represent the more generic threat characteristic which includes sequences within the code of an object behavioral characteristics of an object occurrence of a change event with respect to the occurrence of another change event characteristics that are listed as part of a policy and the like.

In this example a first step in the process begins with the example threat index presented in Table 1 where three threats are listed along with the group of genes that when identified together in a particular object identify that threat as being present in that object. An inverted threat index is then generated such as provided in Table 2 as a result of inverting the threat index provided in Table 1. The inverted threat index provides what threats are associated with a particular gene from Table 1 and how many total number of genes are required to detect those threats. For instance the gene G1 in Table 2 shows that it is associated only with threat T1 and that there are three different genes required to identify threat T1. In another instance the gene G3 in Table 2 shows that it is associated with two threats T1 and T3 where again there are three different genes required to identify threat T1 and where there are two different genes required to identify threat T3.

A next step in the process is for the threat characteristics analyzer to generate a new threat table for each object for which an event has been detected. Table three provides an example of a blank set of threat tables where each row of Table 3 represents a separate threat table . In embodiments the threat characteristics analyzer may generate a new threat table as events dictate or may create a set of blank threat tables for a group of objects to be monitored. In this example threat tables for objects F1 F2 and F3 are listed in a blank set of threat tables .

The threat detection facility now waits for an event capture . In this example suppose that the object F1 is a run time process that experiences a change. The event is captured and the content is passed on to the threat characteristic detector . The threat characteristics analyzer than writes to the gene column of the threat table for the object F1. Referring to Table 4 the threat table for F1 shows that the threat characteristics analyzer has inserted the presence of the gene G1 from the event where G1 is one of the three genes that constitute the threat T1 hence the nomenclature T1 1 3 in added as a threat status indicator in the threats column of table 4 where T1 is the threat and 1 3 indicates that one of the three genes has been detected toward the identification of the threat T1 in the object F1. Note that for the sake of describing this example through the following tables new threat table entries from new event captures will be shown in bold.

The following tables will now depict a series of threat table updates resulting from a series of new events where the threat analyzer monitors the threats column of the threat table for conditions that indicate a threat is present such as in a threat status indicator of T 2 2 indicating that two of two genes for threat T has been found or T 3 3 indicating that three of three genes for threat T has been found.

Referring to Table 5 a new event is captured where the gene G31 is detected in object F2. No entry is entered under the threats column because G31 is not relevant to any of the threats listed in Table 1. In embodiments the threats included in a threat index may be limited to a subset of known threats include all known threats limited to threats relevant to a type of computing device e.g. laptop mobile phone enterprise server and the like.

Referring to Table 6 a new event is captured where gene G2 is detected in object F3. Gene G2 is relevant to both threat T1 and threat T2 and so threat status indicators are added to the threats column for object F3 to indicate that one of the three genes have been detected for T1 T1 1 3 and similarly that one of the three genes have been detected for T2 T2 1 3 .

Referring to Table 7 a new event is captured where the gene G10 is detected in object F1. No additional entry is entered under the threats column of any of the threat tables because G10 is not relevant to any of the threats listed in Table 1.

Referring to Table 8 a new event is captured where the gene G1 is detected in object F2 and a threat status indicator of T1 1 3 is entered into the column under threats for the object F2 indicating that one of the three genes required to identify threat T1 has been detected in the object F2.

Referring to Table 9 a new event is captured where gene G9 is detected in object F3. G9 is not relevant to the threats listed in Table 1.

Referring to Table 10 a new event is captured where gene G3 has detected object F1. Gene G3 is relevant to both threat T1 and threat T3. As a result the threat status indicator for T1 is changed from T1 1 3 to T1 2 3 to indicate that two of the three genes have been detected. Additionally a threat status indicator for T3 is added to indicate that one of the two genes for the threat T3 has been detected in the object F1.

Referring to Table 11 a new event is captured where gene G3 is now detected in object F2. Similar to the last event captured in object F1 the detection of gene G3 is added to the threat table for object F2 where the threat status indicator for T1 is changed from T1 1 3 to T1 2 3 to indicate that two of the three genes have been detected and additionally a status indicator for T3 is added to indicate that one of the two genes for the threat T3 has been detected in the object F1.

Referring to Table 12 a new event is captured where gene G6 is detected in object F3. Gene G6 is relevant to threat T2 and so the status indicator for threat T2 is incremented to indicate T2 2 3 showing that two of the three genes required to identify the threat T2 have been detected in object F3.

Referring to Table 13 a new event is captured where gene G5 is detected in object F1. Gene G5 is relevant to threat T3 and represents the second of the two required genes to identify threat T3 as being detected in object F1. The threat analyzer which as been monitoring the threat tables detects the threat and updates the threat status to indicate that the threat T3 has been detected in object F1. In embodiments the threat detection facility may act on this information in a plurality of ways such as alerting the user of the computer device alerting administration alerting security management taking remedial actions and the like.

The illustrative example presented in association with tables 1 13 are meant to show how an embodiment of the threat detection facility detects a threat through the accumulation of threat characteristics detected in events in processes run on a computing device . In this illustrative example events have been included to provide a fully illustrative example without undue complexity but with sufficient detail to show how the process may proceed. In embodiments the number of objects monitored and the number of threats considered may vary. They may be limited in some manner or they may be comprehensive to the extent of knowledge of the threat management facility . As stated one of the advantages of the threat detection facility may be the ability for the threat detection facility to scale to various applications and thereby provide match of the threat protection to the threat environment of the application and thus improved performance over traditional techniques. For instance threat protection and performance requirements may be very different between a mobile phone application and a desktop computer application and with the threat detection as described herein may be optionally scaled to match desired performance and threat detection criteria. In embodiments the threat tables used by the threat detection facility may be specific to the environment threat landscape such as for mobile desktop server email server gateway centralized network nodes and the like. In embodiments the threat detection facility may utilize threat tables in a hierarchical manner for improved detection such as in a hierarchy of desktop gateway enterprise and the like levels. In embodiments the threat detection facility may provide for multi object protection by having the threat analyzer compare across threat tables. For instance the multi object detection may require that several objects be infected together in order to detect a threat. In embodiments a multi object detection may be detected upon the full or partial detection of threats within each of the multiple objects. For instance the threat analyzer may be provided with an algorithm for determining the likelihood of a multi object threat based on the extent to which threats are completely detected. For example a complete detection in one object and partial detection in two other objects. In embodiments the threat detection facility may support the detection of threats based on not gene detection where the detection of a plurality of genes in combination with a non detection of a plurality of genes results in a detection of a threat. For instance the detection of threat T5 determined with the detection of genes G4 G10 and G42 in combination with the absence of the detection of gene G14.

Referring to an embodiment flow diagram for the current disclosure is provided. In a first step the process begins as a method of dynamic threat detection where the process may be dynamic due to the ability of the threat detection facility providing threat protection over time as threat characteristics are detected and accumulated to scale the use of threat tables for various computing platforms applications and threat environments and the like. In a second step providing a first database e.g. the inverted threat index that correlates a plurality of threat characteristics to a threat wherein a presence of the plurality of the threat characteristics confirms a presence of the threat. The inverted threat index may be stored in a database a listing a table and the like where the threat analyzer uses the content of the inverted threat index to update the threat tables as threat characteristics e.g. genes are detected and included into the threat tables from the threat characteristics analyzer. In a third step detecting a change event in a computer run time process wherein the detecting is provided by the event capture in the computing device and the run time process is run on the computer device such as where the run time process is a computer object run by the operating system . In a forth step testing the change event for a presence of one or more of the plurality of characteristics upon detection of the change event wherein the threat characteristics detector is extracting threat characteristics from the change event for possible insertion into threat tables . In a fifth step storing a detection of one of the plurality of characteristics in a second database that accumulates detected characteristics for the computer run time process where the second database is at least one threat table . In embodiments the threat analyzer may now be utilizing two databases for the detection of a threat where one database is the inverted threat index and the second database is the at least one threat table being updated by the threat characteristics analyzer as threat characteristics are detected in events. In a sixth step identifying the threat when each one of the plurality of characteristics appears in the second database. The threat analyzer monitoring the at least one threat table detects that a threat is present when the at least one threat table is updated to show a completed detected threat. For instance where all of the genes required for a threat to be present have been detected for a given computer object. The threat analyzer may then update the threat status and potentially other actions upon detection of a threat such as described herein.
