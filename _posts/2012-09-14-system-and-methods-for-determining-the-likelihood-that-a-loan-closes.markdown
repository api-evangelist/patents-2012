This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 231 327 filed Sep. 13 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 280 806 which is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 540 988 filed Aug. 13 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 108 302 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 700 045 filed Nov. 4 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 593 890 each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to financial systems and to systems and methods for processing financial information. More particularly the invention relates to systems and methods for determining the likelihood that a loan will result in a closing.

When a borrower submits a mortgage application to a lender or mortgage broker the borrower may be offered an interest rate for the mortgage loan. The interest rate is usually offered for a set period of time referred to as a lock period or lock in period such as a 30 day lock or a 45 day lock. During the lock in period the lender processes the mortgage loan application. The lender s process may include inter alia verifying borrower salary information verifying borrower credit history receiving a property valuation report and receiving a county title records search report that confirms ownership or identifies prior liens. This processing also referred to as workflow of the mortgage loan application may eventually culminate in a closing. In a real estate transaction closing also known as the close means the final procedure or meeting in which documents are executed which results in a completion of the loan transaction.

During the lock in period while the lender processes the mortgage loan application the borrower essentially waits for the closing. Although the borrower often has a guaranteed interest rate locked in for the closing current interest rates may fluctuate higher or lower in the period before the closing. If interest rates rise before the closing the borrower will be better off keeping the locked in interest rate and closing on the mortgage loan since a higher interest rate means the borrower pays more interest over the term of the mortgage loan. If interest rates drop before the closing the borrower might be tempted not to close with the locked in interest rate since a lower interest rate means that the borrower pays less over the life of the loan. On the other hand even when current interest rates drop the borrower may decide to forgo a lower interest rate for various reasons. For example if the lower interest rate is only marginally lower e.g. 0.1 the borrower may decide it is not worth the time and effort to pursue getting another mortgage loan with a minimally lower interest rate. When the borrower decides not to close the borrower s mortgage loan application is considered a fallout application since it falls out of the mortgage loan workflow.

When a borrower s mortgage loan application is a fallout application not closing the lender as well as the appraiser and title company would have expended resources to process the mortgage loan application up until the point it became a fallout application. When the volume of mortgage loan applications is heavy such as during a re financing surge a lender may turn away or delay the processing of other mortgage loan applicants to process a mortgage loan application that falls out. As such there is a need to determine whether a specific loan may fallout so that a lender may prioritize the workflow associated with mortgage loan applications. Similarly an appraisal firm title company or other entity doing work on the loan application may need to know the likelihood of fallout to prioritize its work. Further sometimes these entities are not paid for their work if the loan does not close.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to systems and methods for processing financial information and more particularly systems and methods for determining the likelihood that a loan will close.

A financial system consistent with the systems and methods of the present invention may receive application information such that the application information includes at least borrower information property information and a first interest rate receive home value information such that the home value information represents an estimated value of the property receive a second interest rate and determine the indication based on the received application information received home value information and received second interest rate such that the indication represents a likelihood that the mortgage loan may close.

In another embodiment of the invention systems and methods are provided for processing one or more mortgage loan applications based on a score. For example systems and methods consistent with the invention may receive information representative of a mortgage loan application for a property and determine the score based on the received information such that the score represents a likelihood that the mortgage loan application may close. Moreover in an aspect of the invention processing of the mortgage loan applications may be performed such that at least one of the mortgage loan applications is processed before another mortgage loan application based on the determined score for at least one mortgage loan application.

In yet another embodiment systems and methods consistent with the invention may be used in performing appraisals on one or more properties based on scores wherein each of the scores indicates whether a mortgage loan application is likely to result in a closing. For example systems and methods consistent with the invention may receive a first score for a first property of the one or more properties and receive a second score for a second property of the one or more properties. It may then perform a first appraisal of the first property before a second appraisal of the second property when the first score indicates a greater likelihood of closing than the second score.

In yet another embodiment systems and methods consistent with the invention may be used in performing title searches on one or more properties based on scores wherein each of the scores indicates whether a mortgage loan application is likely to result in a closing. For example systems and methods consistent with the invention may receive a first score for a first property of the one or more properties and receive a second score for a second property of the one or more properties. It may then perform a first title search of the first property before a second title search of the second property when the first score indicates a greater likelihood of closing than the second score.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the system and method particularly described in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as described. Further features and or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example the present invention may be directed to various combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed features and or combinations and subcombinations of several further features disclosed below in the detailed description.

Reference will now be made in detail to the invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

Systems and methods consistent with the invention permit an entity using a computing platform or computer to determine an indication of whether a mortgage loan application is likely to result in a closing. In one aspect of the invention the indication is determined in the form of a score also referred to herein as a Fallout Score . When a score is used a relatively low score may indicate that the mortgage loan application is less likely to result in closing of a mortgage while a relatively high score may indicate that the mortgage loan application is likely to result in closing. The determined indication or score may then be provided to any entity such as a lender appraiser or title company so that the entity may prioritize its resources when processing mortgage loan applications. For example the entity may prefer to first process loans that are more likely to close than loans that are less likely to close.

Lenders may include a financial entity such as a bank mortgage bank mortgage broker mortgage originator and or any other entity seeking an indication of whether a mortgage loan application is likely to result in a closing.

Appraisers may include an entity that estimates the value of a property. For example the appraiser may be an individual certified or registered to perform an appraisal of real property by inter alia visiting the property performing a market analysis and estimating its market value. Alternatively the appraiser may simply be a broker who provides his or her estimate of value known as a broker s price opinion or the appraised value might be derived from an automated valuation model.

Title companies may include an entity that performs a title search and or insures or warrants the title against defects in the title or encumbrances against the asset.

Information source s may include internal external proprietary and or public databases such as financial databases and demographic databases.

Moreover output module may be used to print or display any information received such as mortgage loan application information title information current interest rate information and or home valuation information. Although only illustrates a single output module a plurality of spatially separated output modules may be used.

For one or more mortgage loan applications database may store mortgage loan application information home value information and or other information . Moreover database may store information including financial information demographic information real estate information credit information and other public and or proprietary information that is kept within an entity or organization. For example database may store information received from information source s such as interest rate information points and fees paid at application and later credit history credit ratings or scores estimates of property values median and or average housing pricing in a region e.g. a street neighborhood ZIP code city county or state . The information stored in database may be received from any server including information source s and or entities . Although database is shown in as being located with computing platform a skilled artisan would recognize that the database or databases may be located anywhere or in multiple locations and connected to computing platform via direct links or networks.

To receive mortgage loan application information step processor may receive from an entity such as lender mortgage loan application information through communication channel . depicts database with an example of mortgage loan application information . Referring to mortgage loan application information also referred to as application level includes one or more of the following type of mortgage property information and loan purpose information borrower information employment information income and expense information assets and liability information transaction details and other information .

Type of mortgage information describes the type of mortgage and includes one or more of the following type of mortgage applied for such as Veterans Administration VA Fair Housing Administration FHA or conventional a lender case or tracking number interest rate information such as fixed or adjustable whether the loan amortizes or is interest only whether any credit enhancements are involved such as additional collateral or mortgage insurance.

Property information and loan purpose information describes the subject property and or the reason for the loan and includes one or more of the following address of the subject property year subject property was built number of units on the subject property address purpose of the loan such as whether the loan funds will be used to purchase refinance construct the property provide cash out from the equity or replace a construction loan with a permanent loan whether the subject property is the borrower s primary residence secondary residence or is held for investment the name s of proposed title holders of the subject property type of ownership interest such as fee simple or leasehold and source of down payment e.g. from savings and or from borrowed funds .

Borrower information generally describes the borrower s and includes one or more of the following borrower name Social Security Number phone number age years of school marital status number of dependents and address of borrower.

Employment information provides a borrower s employment information and includes one or more of the following current and prior employer names and addresses years with each employer positions or titles and borrower s current business phone.

Income and expense information describes any sources of gross income to borrower s and any sources of expense and includes one or more of the following base employment income income from overtime bonuses commissions professional fee income alimony dividend income interest income rental income rental expense current mortgage expense insurance fees real estate taxes home owner association dues and mortgage insurance.

Assets and liability information describes any assets held by the borrower s and any liabilities and includes one or more of the following cash deposits checking accounts savings accounts stocks bonds mutual funds life insurance net cash value real estate assets e.g. current market value vested interest in a retirement account mortgage liability loan balances credit card debt student loan alimony child support separate maintenance child care and union dues.

Transaction details describe the details of the real estate transaction and includes one or more of the following purchase price of the subject property loan amount term of loan alterations improvements repairs to the subject property land cost when purchased separately prepaid items points paid fees paid at application or to be paid at closing closing costs property mortgage insurance PMI discounts credits and cash from or to borrower.

Other information includes one or more of the following locked interest rate the number of days that the locked interest rate is guaranteed e.g. 30 day 45 day or 60 day lock and the proposed closing date or last day of lock in period for the mortgage application.

Referring again to to receive home value information step processor may receive home value information from information source s . Home value information may provide a valuation estimate of the subject property. The valuation estimate may be provided by any means including a conventional in person appraisal of the subject property a broker s opinion of the value also known as a broker s price opinion or by the use of an automated home valuation. An example of an automated home valuation estimator is Home Value Explorer which generates a property value estimate. Moreover the home value information may also include information concerning the value of homes surrounding the subject property. For example the median and or average estimated home price for a region such as a street neighborhood ZIP code city state or MSA metropolitan statistical area may be received by processor as home value information.

Examples of automated home valuation models may also be found in one or more of the following applications U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 730 289 filed Oct. 11 1996 entitled METHOD FOR COMBINING HOUSE PRICE FORECASTS U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 115 831 filed Jul. 15 1998 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING HOUSE PRICE FORECASTS BASED ON REPEAT SALES MODEL U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 134 161 filed Aug. 14 1998 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING PROPERTY VALUE ESTIMATES U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 728 061 filed Dec. 4 2000 entitled METHOD FOR FORECASTING HOUSE PRICES USING A DYNAMIC ERROR CORRECTION MODEL 

Although the home valuation estimates may be represented in dollars the home valuation estimates may alternatively be described as point values such as a combined point value or a zone point value. The combined point value provided by a home valuation estimator is a property value estimate based on factors that contribute to property value such as comparable housing sales number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. A higher combined point value thus represents a relatively higher valued home. Similarly the zone point value is an estimate of the average or median property value in a zone or region and is based on factors that contribute to average property value in an area or region such as comparable sales and median income. A higher zone point value also represents a relatively higher average or median property value for a region.

To receive other information step processor may receive through communication channel interest rate information. For example processor may receive daily current interest information for various mortgage products such as 30 year fixed rate mortgages 30 year jumbo fixed rate mortgages adjustable rate mortgages 15 year fixed mortgages 10 year fixed mortgages and or interest only mortgages. The current interest rate information may be received from a source of such information such as lenders and financial publications e.g. interest rates offered on a daily basis by a lender whether provided orally electronically or in tangible written form. In addition to current interest rates processor may also receive an indication of interest rate volatility described in greater detail below corresponding to the amount of interest rate fluctuation over a time period such as 30 or 60 days. Furthermore processor may receive an indication of workflow required for the mortgage loan application. For example processor may receive information indicating whether all required or necessary documents have been prepared or completed before closing whether the appraisal has been performed and whether a title search has been completed.

To determine a likelihood indication that the received mortgage loan application will close with the locked mortgage interest rate step processor may process the mortgage loan application information home value information and other information received in steps . In one embodiment processor determines the likelihood indication in the form of a score. The score also referred to herein as a Fallout Score provides an indication of whether the mortgage loan application may result in a closing with the locked mortgage interest rate. The score may further indicate whether closing will occur on or before a specified date such as a closing date or the last day of e.g. a 30 day lock period.

In one aspect of the invention the Fallout Score is scaled into a range of 300 to 900 such that a Fallout Score of 300 indicates a greater likelihood that a mortgage application will not close. On the other hand a Fallout Score of 900 would indicate that the mortgage application is likely to close. Alternatively the Fallout Score may be scaled into a range such that a lower score e.g. 300 indicates that a mortgage application will probably close while a higher score e.g. 900 indicates that it will probably not close.

In one aspect of the invention the Fallout Score is determined based on a model as well as the received mortgage loan application information received home value information and other received information . The information received in steps are used to initialize or set the values of variables in the model such as Fallout. Score model. Table 1 below lists exemplary variables that may be used in the Fallout Score model. To facilitate explanation of the model only a select number of variables are listed and described in Table 1. However a skilled artisan will recognize based on reading the detailed description herein that any number of variables may be used to determine a likelihood indication such as the Fallout Score.

The variable INTEREST RATE SPREAD corresponds to the difference between a currently available i.e. available as of the time of the analysis interest rate and the locked mortgage interest rate for the mortgage application. For example a borrower submits a mortgage application and is offered an interest rate e.g. 5 that is locked for 30 days so that if the borrower closes within 30 days the mortgage is financed at 5 . However during the 30 day period interest rates on mortgages may fluctuate above or below the locked mortgage interest rate. In this example the currently available interest rate interest may rise to 5.5 or fall to 4.5 . In the case when the currently available interest rate rises to 5.5 the INTEREST RATE SPREAD is equal to 0.5 locked in rate of 5.0 5.5 currently available interest rate . Here the borrower is better off keeping in the lower locked rate. In the case when the currently available interest rate falls to 4.8 the INTEREST RATE SPREAD is equal to 0.2 5 locked in interest rate 4.8 currently available interest rate . With a 0.2 lower interest rate the borrower may be tempted to abandon closing the loan transaction and thus fallout of the mortgage loan application process since interest rates are lower elsewhere. The value of INTEREST RATE SPREAD is just one of the factors or variables considered when determining the likelihood that a mortgage loan application will proceed to close or whether the loan will fall out not close .

The variable DAYS UNTIL CLOSE represents the number of days until the mortgage loan application closes. For example a mortgage with a 30 day lock may have 30 days or fewer days until closing so that on the day of closing the variable DAYS UNTIL CLOSE has a value of 0. 

The variable CS represents a credit score for the borrower and is expressed as an integer. For example a credit score may provide an indication of the credit risk associated with a borrower. A borrower that is a high credit risk more likely to default may have a low credit score e.g. 400. On the other hand a borrower that is a low credit risk may have relatively higher credit score e.g. 800. The variable MCRED corresponds to a value of 1 if a credit score is missing for the borrower otherwise MCRED has a value of 0.

The variable 30 day corresponds to a value of 1 if the mortgage loan application includes a 30 day lock on the interest rate offered to the borrower. Otherwise the value of the variable 30 Day is 0. The variable 60 day corresponds to a value of 1 if the mortgage application includes a 60 day lock on the offered interest rate and to a value of 0 otherwise. The variable FIXED corresponds to a value of 1 if the mortgage loan application is for a fixed rate mortgage type or to a value of 0 otherwise. The variable JUMBO corresponds to a value of 1 if the mortgage loan application is for a jumbo type mortgage e.g. higher valued mortgage loans or to a value of 0 otherwise. The variable ARM corresponds to a value of 1 if mortgage loan application is for an adjustable rate mortgage and otherwise to a value of 0. The variable 30 YEAR corresponds to a 1 if the mortgage loan application is for a 30 year mortgage and otherwise to a value of 0. The variable 15 YEAR corresponds to a 1 if the mortgage loan application is for a 15 year mortgage and to a 0 otherwise.

The variable COMBINED POINT VALUE provides a loan level factor in determining the Fallout Score. The variable COMBINED POINT VALUE represents a valuation estimate of the subject property. Although the valuation estimate may be represented in dollars it may be normalized on a point scale such as 1 to 1000. For example the COMBINED POINT VALUE of a 1 bedroom home with 1 bathroom may be 500 while the COMBINED POINT VALUE of a higher value 5 bedroom 4 bath home may be 600. The COMBINED POINT VALUE thus represents a property s estimated market value.

The variable ZONE POINT VALUE corresponds to the median or average valuation estimate for properties in a region associated with the subject property. Although the median or average valuation estimate for a region may be represented in dollars the ZONE POINT VALUE may be normalized on a point scale such as 1 to 1000. Returning to the above example the ZONE POINT VALUE for the region associated with the two properties above may be 650.

The purpose of the loan such as whether the loan is for a purchase refinance or cash out mortgage may also be considered. For example the variable PURCHASE is set to a value of 1 if the mortgage loan purpose is for a home purchase and otherwise to a value of 0. The variable REFINANCE corresponds to a value of 1 if mortgage loan purpose is for a refinance and otherwise to a value of 0. The variable CASH OUT corresponds to a value of 1 if mortgage loan purpose includes cash paid to the borrower and otherwise to a value of 0.

The variable NUMBER POINTS PAID corresponds to the number of points paid if any by the borrower at closing.

The variable FEEPCT corresponds to the amount of fees paid by the borrower at loan application as a percentage of the loan amount. Alternatively the dollar amount of fees may be used as a variable.

The value of the variable LTV loan to value may correspond to the ratio of the loan amount to the fair market value of the property multiplied by 100. For example a mortgage of 100 000 on a property valued at 200 000 would have an LTV of 50. The LTV ratio may also be expressed as a decimal. In this case the LTV ratio would be 0.50.

The variable VOLATILITY represents the standard deviation or variance associated with mortgage interest rates over a time period. For example the standard deviation of mortgage interest rates may be determined over a 30 day period. In this example if mortgage interest rates fluctuate very little or not at all over the 30 days the standard deviation will be relatively low. If the mortgage rates fluctuate considerably over the 30 days the standard deviation may be relatively higher when compared to the case when it changes very little or not at all . Larger values of the standard deviation represent a larger amount of interest rate volatility. As such when the variable VOLATILITY is relatively low interest rates are stable i.e. not volatile while a relatively higher value of VOLATILITY represents a higher degree of interest rate volatility.

The variable DOCS DRAWN corresponds to a value of 1 if the lender has completed or drawn all necessary pre closing documents and otherwise to a value of 0. The DOCS DRAWN variable represents an event in the workflow associated with processing a mortgage loan application. Although the documents drawn event is described herein any other workflow events may be used instead of or in addition to DOCS DRAWN such as the appraisal completion date or title search completion date.

With the Fallout Score determined processor may provide the determined Fallout Score to an entity such as lender through network interface and communication channel step . The Fallout Score may be provided though a network interface such as a web browser.

In some instances processor may determine the Fallout Score repeatedly until the mortgage loan application closes step . In one embodiment processor may repeat steps on a daily basis until the loan closes. In another case processor may perform an initial Fallout. Score determination and then determine another Fallout Score 15 days before the proposed mortgage closing date or the end of the lock in period .

In one embodiment an appraiser may receive one or more scores for properties requiring an appraisal. The appraiser may then perform the appraisals based on the Fallout Score. For example the appraiser may prioritize completion of the appraisal of a property that is more likely to result in a closing based on the Fallout Score than another property that is less likely to result in a closing.

In another embodiment a title company may receive one or more scores for properties requiring title searches and then perform the title searches based on the Fallout Score. For example the title searcher may first perform title searches on properties that are more likely to result in a closing based on the Fallout Score than on those properties that are less likely to result in closings.

In one embodiment processor or computing platform therein may also generate the Fallout Score model. Although the Fallout Score model is described any type of model or mathematical transform may be used instead. shows a flowchart depicting the steps associated with generating the Fallout Score model. Computing platform may receive reference also referred to by those of ordinary skill as historical or truth information step determine one or more coefficients or weights for the Fallout Score model based on the received reference information step and then provide the Fallout Score model step so that it can be used to generate Fallout Scores.

Computing platform may receive from information source s or database reference information for one or more mortgage loan applications also referred to herein as reference mortgage applications step . The reference information may include mortgage loan application information home value information and any other information such as interest rate information available before the mortgage loan closed. In addition the reference information identifies whether each of the reference mortgage applications closed. For example a reference mortgage application may include a 30 day lock the corresponding locked mortgage interest rate the closing date and daily interest rate information for each of the 30 days leading up to closing. The reference information may include information that is considered reliable and preferably verified e.g. truth data .

To determine the coefficients step computing platform may process the reference information received in step based on statistical techniques such as a logistic regression. By using statistical techniques computing platform may determine the corresponding coefficients or weights of the Fallout Score model such that the model can determine a Fallout Score. Referring again to the exemplary Fallout Score model lists coefficients including the following 600 500 50 1 0.5 5 1 10 20 3.5 5 20 100 100 3 20 10 10 10 2 20 and 100. Computing platform thus uses a statistical technique to determine each of these coefficients.

In one embodiment computing platform may use a statistical technique referred to as logistic regression to determine the coefficients of step . Logistic regression models may be used to examine how various factors influence a binary outcome. An event or result that has two possible outcomes is a binary outcome e.g. good bad or close not close . Logistic modeling is available with many statistical software packages. For example the commercially available statistical packages offered by SAS Institute Inc. include logistic regression modeling tools.

To determine the outcome for each of the reference mortgage loan applications included in the reference information step computing platform may determine whether the mortgage loan application closed or not i.e. was a fallout . When a mortgage loan application closes computing platform may set the outcome to a value of 1. When a mortgage loan does not close computing platform may set the outcome to a 0. 

Alternatively the outcome may be defined as whether the mortgage closes within a time period such as within 15 days. For example for each of the loans included as reference information if the loan closes within 15 days of specified date then the outcome is set to a 1 indicating a closing. When a loan fails to close within those 15 days the outcome is set to a 0. 

Referring again to computing platform may determine the likelihood or odds for each of the possible outcomes step . To determine the likelihood computing platform may further process the reference information using a logistic regression to determine the odds that an outcome is possible. For example the computing platform may determine the likelihood that a mortgage application closes or alternatively falls out based on the following variables or factors INTEREST RATE SPREAD VOLATILITY CREDIT SCORE COMBINED POINT VALUE and DOCS DRAWN.

In one embodiment computing platform uses the following equation to determine the odds or likelihood that an outcome such as a faulty appraisal is possible Log 1 INTEREST RATE SPREAD VOLATILITY CREDIT SCORE COMBINED POINT VALUE DOCS DRAWN other variables Equation 1 where Log p 1 p represents the log odds also referred to as LOGIT that the reference mortgage loan application is likely to close p represents the probability of a reference mortgage loan application having a 0 outcome or a 1 outcome a b b . . . brepresent the initial coefficients of the Fallout Score model and n 1 represents the number of coefficients used in the Fallout Score model. Before computing platform utilizes a logistic regression the values of a b b . . . b and p may be unknown.

In this example the computing platform uses six coefficients i.e. n 6 corresponding to an intercept and the following five variables INTEREST RATE SPREAD VOLATILITY CREDIT SCORE COMBINED POINT VALUE and DOCS DRAWN. Although this example uses six coefficients a skilled artisan would recognize that additional coefficients and corresponding variables may be used instead. Indeed any other variables or factors may be used that serve as an indication of whether a mortgage application is likely to close or not. The five variables described herein are only a select few of the many that can be used and the selection of these five is only exemplary to facilitate explanation herein. Examples of other factors that may be used in the model include the variables of the Table 1 above or any other information included in or related to a mortgage loan application.

Although p is an unknown value at the start of the logistic regression p may conform to the following equation 1 1 Equation 2 where is the following INTEREST RATE SPREAD VOLATILITY CREDIT SCORE COMBINED POINT VALUE DOCS DRAWN . . . Other variable s . Equation 3

Computing platform may then determine an estimate of the coefficients of the Fallout Score model step . That is the computing platform may solve for an estimate of a b b. . . busing equations 1 3.

Although computing platform may utilize a logistic regression approach as described in this example a skilled artisan would recognize that any other approach may be used instead to determine the coefficients such as the Probit regression approach available from SAS Institute Inc. standard regression neural networks classification trees and any other statistical or quantitative approach that may provide coefficients based on reference information or truth data .

Referring again to to adjust the one or more of the coefficients determined in step computing platform may scale the coefficients a b b . . . b step . In one embodiment computing platform may scale the coefficients by multiplying each coefficient by the following equation actual coefficient initial coefficient 60 ln 2 Equation 4 where ln is a natural logarithm. By using equation 4 computing platform may scale the initial coefficients such that every 60 Fallout Score points doubles the odds that a mortgage application is likely to close. The scaled coefficients may be used as the actual coefficients used in the Fallout Score model such as the model illustrated in . Accordingly computing platform may determine one or more coefficients for the Fallout Score model based on a logistic regression approach using reference information see e.g. step that describes one or more reference mortgage loan applications. Computing platform may then use the Fallout Score model to determine the Fallout Score.
