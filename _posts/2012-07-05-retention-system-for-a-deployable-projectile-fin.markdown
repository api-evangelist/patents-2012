The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates to a fin retention system for a projectile having deployable fins to hold the fins in their undeployed position until after launch.

Many projectiles such as mortars missiles and the like have deployable fins i.e. fins that are movable between an undeployed position and a deployed position. In their undeployed position the fins are folded or pivoted towards the projectile thus reducing the overall diameter of the projectile around its fins. Conversely upon deployment the fins pivot or fold outwardly to their deployed position thus increasing the overall circumference of the projectile around the fins i.e. super caliber fins .

In practice the fins are maintained in their undeployed position all the way through the launch of the projectile from a launch tube. It is only after the projectile exits from the launch tube that the projectile fins move to their deployed position. Any conventional means such as springs or simply the inertia of the fins may be used to move the fins to their deployed position immediately after exiting from the launch tube.

There have been previously known methods and devices to hold the fins in their undeployed position until immediately after launch. For example there have been previously known active electric or mechanical actuators which move the fins from their undeployed and to their deployed position immediately after launch. These systems however are relatively expensive and heavy in construction. Furthermore since these systems are active systems the failure of the fin deployment system can occur possibly with catastrophic results.

Still other systems such as Kevlar strings and passive bore guides similar to a sabot have also been previously known to hold the fins in their undeployed position until immediately after launch. These previously known systems have all suffered various disadvantages such as high cost and insufficient reliability.

The present invention provides an externally mounted fin retention system for a projectile having deployable fins which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices.

In brief the fin retention system of the present invention comprises a plurality of identical fin retention units wherein each fin retention unit is associated with one of the deployable fins of the projectile and whereby each fin deploys independently of the others. Thus a projectile having three independently deploying fins will have three fin retention units a projectile having four independently deploying fins will have four fin retention units and so forth.

Each fin retention unit includes an alignment device and a pair of generally planar span arms. The span arms protrude laterally outwardly from opposite sides of the alignment device.

An attachment device is positioned adjacent to a free end of one of the span arms for each retention unit while a cooperating attachment device is positioned adjacent to a free end of the other of the span arms. Each attachment device is dimensioned to lock with its cooperating attachment device and preferably the attachment device and cooperating attachment device are snap locks.

With the fins of the projectile in an undeployed position one alignment device is aligned with each fin. Simultaneously the attachment device of each retention unit is attached to the cooperating attachment device of the adjacent retention unit. This locks the retention units in place surrounding both the projectile and the undeployed fins. A pin on each alignment device preferably engages a receiving notch in the projectile fin so that with the fin retention units positioned around the undeployed fins and locked together the fin retention system is not only locked against axial movement relative to the projectile but also holds the undeployed fins in their undeployed position.

In order to launch the projectile the projectile with its attached fin retention unit is positioned within the launch tube. Separating the fin retention system from the projectile immediately after launch i.e. upon exiting from the launch tube may be achieved in different fashions. For example the fin retention units may be constructed of a combustible material so that during launch the combustion products from the projectile launch also combust the fin retention system to such a degree that any remaining remnants of the fin retention units after launch will be separated from the projectile by inertial and or aerodynamic drag forces. Alternatively the fin retention units may be constructed of a flame retardant material and simply separate from the projectile immediately after launch by breaking away from the projectile through inertial and or aerodynamic drag forces.

The fin retention system of the present invention enjoys low cost and high reliability due in large part to its simplicity lack of moving parts and suitability for being mass produced. The fin retention system of the present invention relies solely upon existing events during the launch of the projectile in order to separate the fin retention system from the projectile.

With reference first to a projectile having deployable fins only one shown in is illustrated. The projectile may be of any conventional construction such as a mortar missile or the like.

The deployable fins are movable from their undeployed position illustrated in phantom line in and their deployed position illustrated in solid line in . When the fins are in their undeployed position the overall diameter of the projectile is reduced thus facilitating not only shipping and storage of the projectile but also enabling the projectile with its undeployed fins to be positioned within a launch tube .

The number of fins may vary for different projectiles . However typically each projectile includes at least three fins and usually not more than four or five. Additionally the fins are usually equidistantly circumferentially spaced around the projectile .

With reference now to a fin retention system is shown for retaining the fins of the projectile in an undeployed position until immediately after exiting the launch tube after launch. The fin retention system includes a plurality of substantially identical fin retention units wherein one fin retention unit is associated with each fin on the projectile .

With reference now to a single fin retention unit is shown it being understood that a like description shall also apply to the other fin retention units . The fin retention unit includes an alignment member having a slot dimensioned to receive its associated fin when its associated fin is in its undeployed position. At least a portion of the alignment member physically or mechanically engages its associated fin when undeployed to thereby hold that fin in its undeployed position.

A pair of span arms and respectively extends outwardly from opposite sides of the alignment member . Each span arm and furthermore is substantially planar and the span arms and intersect each other at an angle equal to 60 90 and 108 degrees for a typical projectile with 3 4 or 5 fins respectively. Each span arm and also includes a pair of struts which reduces the weight of the retention unit .

An attachment device is positioned adjacent a free end of the span arm while a cooperating attachment device is positioned adjacent a free end of the other span arm . The attachment devices and selectively lock together in order to secure the adjacent retention units together as shown in . Although any conventional mechanism may be used to secure the attachment devices and together preferably the attachment device is a snap lock where the attachment device is a snap pin and the attachment device is a snap hole complementary in shape but slightly smaller than the snap pin .

With reference now to and with the fin retention unit positioned over its associated fin when the fin is in an undeployed position a pin on the alignment device registers with and is received within a receiving notch on the projectile fin . The mechanical interaction between the pin and the notch on the fin creates a mechanical lock which not only holds the fin in its undeployed position but also locks the fin retention unit against axial movement relative to its associated fin .

In operation the fin retention units are positioned over their associated fins and locked together as shown in . The projectile together with the fin retention system can be loaded into the launch tube . Preferably an outer periphery of the alignment device is rounded in order to prevent damage to the launch tube if the alignment device is made of a material of greater hardness than the launch tube.

For most efficient use the fin retention system should separate from the projectile immediately after exiting from the launch tube. In order to achieve the separation two different systems may be used.

First the fin retention units which are preferably of a one piece construction may be constructed of a flammable material which ignites during the launch of the projectile and burns through at least the struts on the span arms or before exiting from the launch tube. Thus upon launch any remaining portions of the fin retention system will merely separate from the projectile due to inertial and or aerodynamic drag forces.

Alternatively the fin retention units may be constructed of an inert and flame retardant material. In this case the inertial forces acting on the fin retention unit during the launch will cause the fin retention units to separate from each other and or fragment. In either case the fin retention units will separate from the projectile immediately after launch as desired.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple external fin retention unit for use with a projectile having deployable fins. Since the fin retention system of the present invention utilizes no moving parts it enjoys high reliability in operation. Furthermore the fin retention units which form the fin retention system may be mass produced thus reducing the overall cost of the fin retention system.

Having described my invention many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
