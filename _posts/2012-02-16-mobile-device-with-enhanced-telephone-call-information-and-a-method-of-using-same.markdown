The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 366 745 entitled A MOBILE DEVICE WITH ENHANCED TELEPHONE CALL INFORMATION AND A METHOD OF USING SAME which was filed Feb. 6 2009 and is incorporated herein.

The present disclosure relates generally to mobile communications and more particularly to a mobile device with enhanced telephone call information and a method of using same.

Mobile telephones and other mobile communication devices such as smartphones are increasingly provided with greater onboard information and greater access to wireless services and information. However for the most part the information available to mobile telephones is not used to enhance telephone calls. For instance when an incoming call is received from an unknown caller mobile telephones typically provide no mechanism to identify the caller before answering the call. Similarly when a telephone user is seeking to make an outgoing call from a phone application mobile telephones typically require the user to input the telephone number or for the telephone number to be present in a local address book of the mobile telephone. Thus there remains a need for mobile devices with enhanced telephone call information and methods of using the same.

The present disclosure provides in some embodiments a mobile device with a phone application having integrated reverse telephone number lookup for incoming calls and possibly forward telephone number lookup for making outgoing calls. In other embodiments there is provided a mobile device with an email application having a directory service for email address lookups.

Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public Internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly as indicated by the dashed line of via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be required . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email communications to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email server having a global address book a directory service having a contact database and other servers such as a content server for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization s internal servers and an application server for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications to mobile communication devices . While only one directory service is shown it is contemplated that several directory services may be connected to the network in some embodiments.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records created and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The directory service is implemented by a server which may or may not be part of the network . The directory service may be maintained by an individual or enterprise for profit or made freely available. In some embodiments the directory service may be a proprietary contact directory provided by the enterprise which manages the network which is separate from the messaging server . The directory service maintains a contact database which comprises electronic contact records for one or both of individuals and organizations such as businesses .

The contact database comprises at least a name and telephone phone number and possibly other contact information such as one or more of a street address email address Skype address IM address or identifier SIP URI Session Initiation Protocol Uniform Resource Identifier and other contact information or personal details which may be stored in a notes details or equivalent field storing so called extended contact information. The contact database may be provided by or be based on information from publicly listed records from wired telephone carriers e.g. Plain Old Telephone Service POTS carriers Voice Over IP VOIP or wireless telephone carriers. The contact database may be supplemented with provided by or based on contact information provided by alternative contact information sources which may provide more detailed contact information such as social networking services business directory services and the like. Typically the contact information provided by such alternative contact information sources requires the consent of the respective individual or organization e.g. businesses before contact information is made available to the directory service . The directory service in at least some embodiments provides reverse lookup functionality.

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server content server or application servers to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth special interest group or IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or other PAN connection.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a mobile device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device in various embodiments the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The device may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile device is intended to operate.

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software software applications comprising a phone application an email messaging application email application and a personal address book .

The personal address book comprises electronic contact records created by the device user which are stored on the mobile device in memory and possibly in memory of the messaging server . A local copy of the personal address book on the mobile device may be synchronized with a network or enterprise copy maintained by the messaging server so that the personal address book may be accessed by the device user on either the mobile device or an enterprise computer or another computer with remote access to the network .

The phone application email application and personal address book may among other things be implemented through a stand alone software application or combined together in one or more of the operating system and applications . In some example embodiments the functions performed by each of the phone application email application and personal address book may be realized as a plurality of independent elements rather than single integrated elements and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The software applications may include a range of applications including for example an address book application a messaging application a calendar application and or a notepad application. In some embodiments the software applications include an email message application a push content viewing application a voice communication i.e. telephony application a map application and a media player application. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application.

In some embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational tool input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device also includes a removable memory card typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile device stores data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The serial data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system not shown . The serial data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In some embodiments the mobile device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the mobile device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

In the shown embodiment the dialing screen also includes a status bar which displays information such as the current date and time icon based notifications device status and or device state. While the status bar is shown at the top of the dialing screen in the illustrated embodiment in other embodiments the status bar may be located elsewhere such as at the bottom of the dialing screen or may be omitted. The status bar is typically non selectable.

The dialing field in at least some embodiments concurrently interprets both letter and number text inputs. In some embodiments inputs in the dialing field will be interpreted as numbers in a phone number for direct dialing unless a key outside of a number area of the keyboard is depressed i.e. unless a key which is not associated with a number is depressed . For example some mobile devices have full keyboards in which some keys are associated with a number and one or more letters and some keys are associated with one or more letters but no number but possibly a symbol or function or other input . In such embodiments the dialing field may interpret both letter and number inputs as possibilities until there is a sufficient number of characters input to determine whether a telephone number or contact name is being input into the dialing field .

In some embodiments where the keys of the mobile device have at least one number and at least one letter the dialing field prefers numbers to letters and interprets all characters input in the field as numbers until a key which is not associated with a number e.g. a letter key is depressed. In other embodiments the dialing field could prefer letters to numbers with the opposite result.

In yet other embodiments the dialing field could interpret all inputs as alphanumeric inputs. That is all numbers and letters associated with the depressed keys are considered as possibilities. In some embodiments this alternative mode can be initiated using the key combination of ALT letter in the dialing field . This key combination instructs the dialing field and telephone application that the input comprises numbers and letters i.e. 1800BLACKBERRY . Alternatively in yet other embodiments the alternative mode could be initiated using a menu option via corresponding interaction with a menu of the user interface or could be initiated using a hot key a predefined key which triggers an alternative function when held down for a predetermined duration .

The manner in which the dialing field interprets inputs may be based on a preference setting on the mobile device and may be changed by the user during use for example by using a predetermined key combination while the dialing field is active. That is the user can switch between any two or more of the described input modes of the dialing field based on corresponding input. Touchscreen based devices having a similarly configured virtual keyboard may operate in a similar fashion when corresponding virtual keys are activated.

The dialing screen also includes a contact window which displays a list of contacts which match the input in the dialing field . The number of contacts which match the input in the dialing field may exceed the number of references which can fit within the window . In such cases the contact window may be scrollable so that contact records which are not shown in the contact window can be displayed and reviewed by the device user. A scroll bar not shown may be provided as an indication of the availability of scrolling as well as providing a scrolling mechanism and an indication of the relative size of the list of contacts .

The phone application performs a local lookup operation in which the input of the dialing field is compared to electronic contact records in a personal address book stored in memory . As the input in the dialing field changes e.g. more characters are added or characters are removed or changed the phone application re compares the input in the dialing field to the electronic contact records in the personal address book to dynamically generate the list of contacts based on the input in the dialing field . As noted above the personal address book comprises electronic contact records each comprising one or more fields. The personal address book is created by the device user and stored in the memory of the mobile device and possibly in memory of the messaging server . The local copy of the personal address book on the mobile device may be synchronized with a network or enterprise copy maintained by the messaging server .

The contact window also includes a lookup field for performing a lookup of one or both of a global address book also referred to as a network or enterprise address book and a directory service depending on the embodiment and the services available to the network . As noted above the global address book comprises electronic contact records each comprising one or more fields. The global address book is created and maintained by an IT administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . The directory service maintains a contact database which comprises electronic contact records each comprising one or more fields for one or both of individuals and organizations such as businesses .

The lookup field in at least some embodiments is automatically populated with the input from the dialing field the input H is illustrated in . In some embodiments the lookup field requires input to perform a lookup operation. That is while the input from the dialing field is automatically populated in the lookup field the lookup operation itself is not performed without input to perform the operation. In some embodiments the user can change the active field to be the lookup field by corresponding navigational input via the navigational input device for example by moving a scroll wheel or trackball downwards towards the lookup field from the dialing field or using corresponding directional input via a touchscreen. In other embodiments the input of the lookup field must be input directly via respective user input.

In some embodiments activating or selecting the active highlighted lookup field instructs the mobile device to perform a lookup operation on the input in the lookup field the contact name Heather in in the global address book and or using the directory service .

In performing the lookup operation the mobile device may query one or both of the global address book of the messaging server or the contact database of the directory service depending on the system configuration and the settings. When performing a lookup of the global address book the mobile device contacts the messaging server and requests that it compare the lookup field input to the contact records in the global address book determine which contact records match the lookup field input and return contact information to the mobile device about the contact records in the global address book which match the lookup field input. The comparison may be based on one or more of the fields of the contact records in the global address book . The comparison is typically based on at least the name field of the contact records but could also be performed on other fields of the contact records such as organization company.

When performing a lookup of the contact database of the directory service the mobile device contacts directory service and requests that it compare the lookup field input to the contact records in the contact database determine which contact records match the lookup field input and return contact information to the mobile device about the contact records in the contact database which match the lookup field input. The comparison may be based on one or more of the fields of the contact records in the contact database . The comparison is typically based on at least the name field of the contact records but could also be performed on other fields of the contact records such as organization company.

The directory service may be a reverse lookup directory service or reverse lookup such as 411.com or 411.ca any other address directory service for individual businesses or both. The directory service is preferably a telephone directory service for telephones whether cellular POTS landline or VoIP phones but may be any other business or individual contact directory maintaining a listing of individuals and or business having at least name and telephone numbers.

As seen in the returned contact information from the messaging server and or directory service comprises at least the name and telephone number of the matching records and possibly supplemental information such as a department or title company or organization address or other contact information. The returned contact information may be in the form of contact records which may be a reduced or optimized format of the contact records in the global address book or contact database which is suitable for and compatible with the personal address book . Alternatively the returned contact information may be the same format as that in the global address book or contact database or may be unformatted e.g. plain text information.

In some embodiments the returned contact information may be added to the personal address book via respective user input. The returned contact information may create a new contact record if one already exists in the personal address book replace the existing contact record or update the existing contact record to include the new or different information. A prompt may be provided when a contact record already exists in the personal address book . The prompt requests user input as to which one of any two or more of following operations should be performed replacing the contact record updating the contact record adding a new contact record cancelling the operation.

The name and possibly additional contact information returned from the remote lookup operation is displayed in the contact window . illustrates two different embodiments of a dialing screen with returned contact information from a remote lookup operation. illustrates the returned contact information in the contact window in combination with the list of contacts from the personal address book . illustrates the returned contact information in the contact window on its own without the list of contacts from the personal address book . In both additional contact information in the form of a location of the contact is displayed in the form of city province state in the shown embodiment . In other embodiments other or different additional contact information or no additional contact information may be used. The additional contact information provides additional information from which the user can select from the contact information returned from the lookup operation of the remote external contact sources.

In some embodiments the returned contact information may include an indication of the source of the contact information for example as being either from the personal address book or a remote contact resource or providing an indication of whether the source is the personal address book global address book or contact database . The indication may be provided by any suitable means such as a text label and or by using a suitable colour coding scheme for the background and or text of the respective fields. In some embodiments each contact name is highlighted with a different colour which represents the source of the contact name. One colour may be used to highlight contact names from the personal address book so that the user knows the contact is already a stored contact and there is no need to add the contact to the personal address book . A different colour may be used to highlight contact names from the remote contact sources possibly using a different colour for the global address book and contact database .

From the user interface screens of either or D the user can select a contact record in the contact window as the active field by corresponding navigational input via the navigational tool for example by moving a scroll wheel or trackball downwards towards the desired field or using corresponding directional input via a touchscreen. Activating or selecting the active highlighted contact record from the contact window instructs the mobile device to initiate an outbound call to the respective contact. illustrates the selection of the contact Heather Barron of Oakville Ontario from the screen of . A contact could also be selected from the dialing screen of in a similar manner. In other embodiments the contacts could be listed with a corresponding number beside or otherwise associated with the displayed contact names. The phone application is configured so that the phone number associated with a displayed contact name can be selected and dialled by depressing the number key for the number of one of the displayed contact names. For example the following could be presented in the contact window 

In some embodiments if the mobile device has a GPS subsystem for example as part of the auxiliary I O subsystems upon receiving an instruction to perform an external lookup operation the mobile device may determine its current location using the GPS subsystem and send the location information to the messaging server and or directory service with the input of the lookup field to be used in combination when determining which contacts in the global address book and contact database match. That is the location information is used as a secondary criteria or filter. The location information is compared to address information about the contacts in the global address book and or contact database so that only contacts in the same location of the mobile device are selected and returned. The criteria for same location could be the same city same state or province or within a predetermined distance from the current location for the mobile device for example within 40 km. The city associated with the contact may be a convenient and easy to use criterion for determining whether the contact record matches the location of the mobile device . The criteria may be definable and or selectable by the user.

It will be appreciated that the above described embodiments reduce data charges by performing remote lookup operations only when requested based on user input. In other embodiments the remote lookup operation may be performed automatically without user input while the user enters input in the dialing field . This increases the amount of contact information available to the user before making an outgoing call however this requires performing the requisite mobile data access before each call. In such embodiments the returned contact information may be displayed in the contact window in combination with the list of contacts from the personal address book similar to the dialing screen shown in .

Referring now to an example method of providing enhanced telephone call information for an outgoing call in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. Operations of the method are carried out by the processor of the mobile device under the instruction of the phone application module when the phone application is the active application on the device . The dialing screen shown above is the main default screen of the phone application when invoked when there is no incoming call.

The phone application receives an input in the dialing field step via respective input via one or more input devices. The phone application populates the lookup field with the input of the dialing field and performs a local lookup operation of the personal address book step using the lookup field input as the search term. The contact information about contact records in the personal address book which match the search term are then displayed in the contact window see for example .

Next the phone application receives an input request to perform a remote lookup operation on the input of the lookup field step . Optionally in some embodiments if the mobile device has a GPS subsystem the mobile device determines its current location using the GPS subsystem step . As noted above in other embodiments the remote lookup operation may be performed automatically without user input while the user enters input in the dialing field in the same manner as with the personal address book .

Next a lookup operation of the remote contact sources i.e. the global address book and or contact database is performed step . As described this step comprises the processor instructing the messaging server and or directory service to perform a lookup of the respective contact information stores. The instructions include at least the input in the lookup field as the basis for the search lookup. If the mobile device has a GPS subsystem and the mobile device determined its current location using the GPS subsystem in step the instructions also include the location information. Other sources of location information such as triangulation via base stations or location services may be used in other embodiments.

Next the remote contact sources i.e. the messaging server and or directory service perform a lookup operation using the lookup field input and optionally location information as search terms. The remote contact sources then determine which contact records match the lookup field input and optionally location information.

Next contact information from contact records in the global address book and or contact database which match the search criteria are returned to the mobile device . The returned contact information is then displayed in the contact window typically with the list of contacts from the personal address book step .

It will be appreciated that more than one contact name can be found. The multiple contact names can come from the personal address book the remote contact sources or both. When multiple contact names are identified from the personal address book and or remote contact sources the multiple contact names are displayed in an order selected in accordance with a predetermined rule. The predetermined rule may be that the contact names are displayed in descending order based on the closest match based on name comparison based on the most commonly used based on a usage log maintained by the mobile device or other basis. A preference setting may also be provided for the user to specify his or her preferences.

When an outgoing call is placed by selecting a contact from the contact window for example from the list of contacts from the personal address book or returned contact information and corresponding input to place a call to the selected destination number the outgoing call is initiated and a calling user interface screen not shown is displayed on the display screen step . The input to place a call to the highlighted selected contact may be depressing a call or dial button not shown or causing a phone application menu to appear and selecting a menu item requesting the mobile device to place a call to the highlighted selected contact. The calling user interface screen is similar to the incoming call screen shown in with a different notification in the notification field i.e. including a notification in the notification field that an outbound call is in progress such as the text Calling and includes call information in a call information field which comprises at least the telephone number and name . When the contact is from the returned contact information the telephone number and name are that obtained from the remote contact sources.

Next the caller information is optionally added to the call log step . This step is optional and need not be performed in all embodiments.

Next the caller information is optionally added to the personal address book step typically in response to corresponding user input such as causing a phone application menu to appear and selecting a menu item requesting the mobile device to add the contact to the personal address book . This step is optional and need not be performed in all embodiments.

It will be appreciated that in the operations contact information is only returned to the phone application when a phone number is defined for a contact record regardless of whether other contact information such as the contact name matches the search terms used in the lookup. This applies to both local lookup operations and remote lookup operations.

When an incoming call is received on the mobile device the incoming phone number is provided to the mobile device in the radio layer by the wireless network . If call identification ID blocking has been applied to the incoming call by the caller the mobile device is prevented from displaying the telephone number or using the telephone number in which case no telephone number or name are displayed. Typically the mobile device is configured not to display the telephone number when caller ID blocking is in effect to comply with legal requirements rather than being technically incapable of doing so. When incoming call name is private or not known or when call ID blocking has been applied to the incoming call Private Private Name or similar text may be displayed in the incoming call user interface screen .

The name of the caller may be omitted from the radio layer for one or more of several reasons which are not relevant to the present disclosure. In some embodiments the processor under the instructions of the phone application performs a lookup in the personal address book when no name is provided with the incoming call. Alternatively in other embodiments a lookup may be performed on the personal address book regardless of whether a name is provided with the incoming call. These embodiments allow contact information in the personal address book to override any name provided with the incoming call so that the displayed name matches personal preferences of the device user as evidence by the name in the contact record.

The lookup comprises comparing the telephone number provided with the incoming call e.g. in the radio layer to phone numbers stored in the contact records of the personal address book . When a contact record which matches the telephone number is found in the personal address book the corresponding name of a contact record is displayed in the incoming call screen possibly along with extended contact information i.e. contact information in addition to the phone number and name .

As described above the extended contact information may comprise any one or more of a street address email address Skype address IM address or identifier SIP URI or other contact information or details. The extended contact information may be obtained from the personal address book or from the global address book or contact database maintained by the directory service in response to a remote lookup described below.

In some embodiments when there is no matching record in the personal address book a remote lookup is performed on one or both of the global address book maintained by the messaging server and the contact database maintained by the directory service . The directory service used in combination with an incoming call is typically a reverse lookup directory service such as www.411.com or www.411.ca etc. . In some embodiments a remote lookup is performed on the global address book only when there is no matching record in the personal address book . Only when there is no matching record in the global address book a remote lookup is performed on the contact database maintained by the directory service .

As with lookups performed from the dialing screen when performing a lookup in response to an incoming call the mobile device contacts messaging server and or directory service and requests that it compare the telephone number to the contact records in the global address book and contact database respectively determine which contact records match the telephone number and return contact information to the mobile device about the contact records in the global address book and or contact database which match the telephone number . The comparison may be based on one or more of the telephone fields of the contact records.

In some embodiments the remote contact sources i.e. the global address book and or contact database may be used to supplement verify or update contact information provided with the incoming call e.g. in the radio layer and or personal address book . In some embodiments when the name is available from the radio layer and or personal address book the remote contact sources are accessed to obtain additional contact information about the caller which may be displayed in the extended contact information . In such embodiments the remote lookup may be performed using one or both of the phone number and name . The types of missing information which triggers a remote lookup may be stored as a setting on the device or wireless connector system .

In some embodiments the additional contact information is obtained from the remote contact sources when one or more predetermined types of extended contact information are not provided with the incoming call or in the personal address book . For example the additional contact information may be obtained when one or more predetermined fields of the corresponding contact record in the personal address book are empty. For example if the contact record for the caller in the personal address book does not include an email address a lookup may be performed on the global address book and or contact database to obtain the email address from one of those resources if available. The operations can be performed when any predetermined type of contact information is missing from the contact records in the personal address book .

As above the returned contact information from a remote lookup may be added to the personal address book via respective user input.

It will be appreciated that performing a lookup of the global address book or contact database maintained by the directory service consumes battery power via accessing the radio etc. memory and processing resources and typically incurs data transmission charges. The above described embodiments describe alternatives which reduce the number of lookups performed on the global address book and using the directory service by performing lookups on these external resources only when the caller name is not provided with the incoming call e.g. in the radio layer and is not present in the local personal address book . Reducing the number of lookups performed on the global address book and or contact database of the directory service reduces the constraints imposed on device resources but at the expense of access to additional contact information.

In other embodiments lookups may be automatically performed on the global address book and or contact database of the directory service for each incoming call. In yet other embodiments lookup settings on the mobile device or the wireless connector system may by used by the lookup module to determine whether to perform a lookup on the global address book and or the contact database of the directory service for each incoming call or whether lookups are to be performed only when the name or other contact information is not provided with the incoming call and is not present in the local personal address book .

Referring again to the incoming call screen also includes an answer button and ignore button . Highlighting and selecting the answer button via respective user input e.g. highlighting via the navigational tool and selecting the highlighted button by depressing the ENTER key or depressing the navigational tool or depressing an answer key not shown of the mobile device will answer the incoming call. Highlighting and selecting the ignore button via respective user input or depressing an ignore key not shown of the mobile device will ignore the incoming call.

In some embodiments the incoming call information is added to a call log in the form of a call record entry. The call record comprises the telephone number and name and possibly the extended contact information . The call record may be added when an incoming call is answered missed or ignored. In some embodiments outgoing calls may be added to the call log. The call records for outgoing calls may include the same type of information as for incoming calls. The call records in the call log in at least some embodiments expire after a predetermined duration such as after 30 days from the date the call occurred or the incoming call was received. The call log expiry conserves local memory on the mobile device . The predetermined duration is typically set so that any important call information will be added by the user to the personal address book within the predetermined duration.

The incoming phone number and name displayed in the call information field of the call in progress screen are the same as that of the incoming call screen . In particular the phone number is the number previously obtained from the radio layer and the name is the name previously obtained from the radio layer or determined from the personal address book global address book or contact database . Extended contact information associated with the respective contact and incoming phone number may be displayed in the incoming call screen in some embodiments. The extended contact information may be displayed even if not previously displayed in the incoming call screen . The extended contact information may be determined prior to the call being answered even if this information is not displayed in the incoming call screen . However if the extended contact information was not determined prior to the call being answered it must be determined after the call is answered as described above if it is to be displayed in the call in progress screen .

It will be appreciated that other user interface elements may be displayed in the incoming call screen and the call in progress screen in other embodiments. For example while not shown the call in progress screen may include a user interface element providing an indication of the current speaker volume and possibly a user interface element which provides the ability to adjust the speaker volume.

Referring now to an example method of providing enhanced telephone call information for an incoming call in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. Operations of the method are carried out by the processor of the mobile device under the instruction of the phone application module .

The phone application receives an incoming call from a telephone number step of a calling phone which could be a landline or POTS phone VoIP phone wireless telephone or cellular telephone. Next the phone application determines whether caller ID blocking has been applied to the incoming call or other restrictions which prevent the phone application from displaying the phone number and or name associated with the incoming call step . This step is typically performed by analysing information contained in the radio layer as would be understood by persons skilled in the art. If caller ID blocking has been applied to the incoming call or other restrictions which prevent the phone application the operations end. Otherwise the operations continue to step .

Next the phone application determines whether a name is associated with the incoming call step typically by analysing information contained in the radio layer as would be understood by persons skilled in the art. If no name is associated with the incoming call operations proceed to step . If a name is associated with the incoming call the operations end. In other embodiments depending on predetermined settings applied by the phone application typically stored in memory on the mobile device or wireless connector system operations may proceed to step where the name provided with the incoming call is to be replaced with or supplemented by contact information from other sources optional step .

Next a lookup operation of the local address book is performed step to determine the name and optionally extended contact information.

Next if the local address book does not contact a contact record which matches the incoming phone number or name in some embodiments e.g. when the operations proceed via step a lookup operation of the remote contact sources i.e. the global address book and or contact database is performed step to determine the name and optionally extended contact information. As described this step comprises the processor instructing the messaging server and or directory service to perform a lookup of the respective contact information stores. The instructions include at least the incoming phone number and possibly the name. Next the remote contact sources perform a lookup operation using the incoming phone number and possibly the name as search terms. The remote contact sources then determine which contact records match the incoming phone number and possibly the name. Next contact information from contact records in the global address book and or contact database which match the search criteria are returned to the mobile device . If contact information is available from more than one source rules defining which contact information is to be used are applied by the processor .

One or more rules may be defined to resolve conflicts where contact information from more than one contact source exists. The rules may define i a preference associated with the contact sources e.g. personal address book information provided with the incoming call and remote contact sources in decreasing order of preference ii the contact information from the contact record having the most recent up to date contact information is to be used which may for example be determined by comparing respective dates associated with the creation revision modification of the respective contact records or iii the contact record having the most contact information is to be used. The rules for resolving conflicts are typically stored in the memory of the mobile device .

In some embodiments if there is any ambiguity as to which contact information should be used e.g. for example which contact information is the most recent a window or dialog box may be displayed on the display screen which prompts the user to confirm via corresponding input which contact information should be used e.g. which contact information is the correct information or most up to date . The default may be that the closest match is displayed based on name comparison or that the most commonly used based on a usage log maintained by the mobile device is displayed. A preference setting may also be provided for the user to specify his or her preferences.

Next the caller information i.e. contact information is displayed in an incoming call screen on the display screen step . If the call is answered the caller information is displayed in a call in progress screen on the display screen step . In other embodiments the caller information is displayed only in the call in progress screen .

Next the caller information is optionally added to the call log step . The caller information may be added to the call log regardless of whether the call is answered in some embodiments. This step is optional and need not be performed in all embodiments.

Next the caller information is optionally added to the personal address book step typically in response to corresponding user input such as causing a phone application menu to appear and selecting a menu item requesting the mobile device to add the contact to the personal address book . This step is optional and need not be performed in all embodiments.

It will be appreciated that the operations are performed automatically by the processor without any user input with the possible exception of step which may require user input to add the caller information to the personal address book in some embodiments. However input from settings may be used in determining whether some of the steps in the operations are determined for a particular incoming call.

When one of the address fields is active i.e. when one of the To CC or BCC fields is active entry of an input causes the processor to perform a local lookup operation of the input in the respective field to contact records in the personal address book to determine if the input matches any contacts records. The lookup operation comprises comparing the input to one or more fields of the contact records. Typically the fields used in comparison comprise at least the name field but may also comprise one or more of the company organization field title department field email address field or other text fields of the contact records in the personal address book . Typically the results of the lookup operation are displayed in a pop up window adjacent to the address field which overlays a portion of the user interface screen . In other embodiments the results could be integrated within the user interface screen rather than displayed in a pop up window .

The pop up window is populated with a list of contact names of the contact records which match the input in the address field. Additional information may be included with the name in some embodiments. The additional information may comprise an organization business a location associated with the contact record such as a street address city or city and state. In other embodiments the pop up window may be populated with a list of email addresses of the contact records which match the input in the address field. The type and nature of the displayed information in the pop up window may be determined in accordance with predetermined settings.

The pop up window may also include a lookup field similar to the lookup field . Alternatively the lookup field may be invoked from the screen for example from the address field by causing an email application menu to appear and selecting a corresponding menu item requesting the lookup field to be displayed.

When activated selected for example in the manner described above in connection with the lookup field the lookup field performs a lookup on the global address book and or contact database of the directory service to find contact records which match the input in the address field. Upon receiving input to perform a lookup the processor instructs the messaging service and or directory service and requests the lookup field input be compared to the contact records in the global address book and or contact database as the case may be determines which contact records match the lookup field input and returns contact information to the mobile device about the contact records that match the lookup field input. The comparison may be based on one or more of the fields of the contact records in the global address book and or contact database . The comparison is typically based on at least the name field of the contact records but could also be performed on other fields of the contact records such as organization.

Referring now to an example method of providing enhanced email information in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. Operations of the method are carried out by the processor of the mobile device under the instruction of the email application module . The message composition screen shown above is the default screen of the email application .

In the first step the email application receives an input in an address field e.g. To CC or BCC field in the address portion of the screen via respective input via one or more input devices. Next the processor performs a local lookup operation of the personal address book step using the input in the address field as the search term. The contact information about contact records in the personal address book which match the search term are then displayed in a pop up window step or possibly within the address field for example if there is only one matching record .

Next the email application receives an input request to perform a remote lookup operation on the input of the address field step . Optionally in some embodiments if the mobile device has a GPS subsystem the mobile device determines its current location using the GPS subsystem step .

Next a lookup operation of the remote contact sources i.e. the global address book and or contact database is performed step . As described this step comprises the processor instructing the messaging server and or directory service to perform a lookup of the respective contact information stores. The instructions include at least the input in the lookup field as the basis for the search lookup. If the mobile device has a GPS subsystem and the mobile device determined its current location using the GPS subsystem in step the instructions also include the location information. Other sources of location information such as triangulation via base stations or location services may be used in other embodiments.

Next the remote contact sources i.e. the messaging server and or directory service perform a lookup operation using the lookup field input and optionally location information as search terms. The remote contact sources then determine which contact records match the lookup field input and optionally location information. Next contact information from contact records in the global address book and or contact database which match the search criteria are returned to the mobile device . The returned contact information is then displayed in the pop up window or possibly address field. The returned contact information may be displayed with the contact names of contact records from the personal address book step which match the input in the address field. If contact information is available from more than one source rules defining which contact information is to be used are applied by the processor .

The user can then add further contacts in one or more address fields add a subject in the subject field and add a message body in the body portion in the normal way. Further contact names can be looked up in the same manner as described above. After the completion of the message composition the device user can send the message to the selected recipients contacts specified in the address field s using the wireless network in the normal way. The device user could also at any time select to save the message as a draft in at least some embodiments or possibly cancel the message composition and discard the input data and any contact information which was obtained from the lookup operations.

Next the contact information is optionally added to the personal address book step typically in response to corresponding user input such as causing an email application menu to appear and selecting a menu item requesting the mobile device to add the contact to the personal address book . This step is optional and need not be performed in all embodiments.

It will be appreciated that in the operations contact information is only returned to the email application when an email address is defined for a contact record regardless of whether other contact information such as the contact name matches the search terms used in the lookup. This applies to both local lookup operations and remote lookup operations.

While the operations and have been described as occurring in a particular order it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. For example the contact information may be added to the personal address book at any time after it has been returned to the mobile device . Furthermore some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub steps in other embodiments.

While the operations and have been described as being performed by the phone application or email application the integrated lookup field described herein can be applied to the contact input field of any communication application e.g. any voice or text based communication . For example the integrated lookup field could be used for text messaging e.g. SMS or MMS instant messaging IM and chats or conversations or in the contact input edit fields of the personal address book . Accordingly the present disclosure also provides a method of providing enhanced contact information on an electronic device comprising displaying a user interface screen of an application on a display screen of the electronic device the user interface screen including a contact input field receiving input via the contact input field determining if a contact name in an address book stored in a memory of the device matches the input in the contact input field determining if a contact name in a remote contact source matches the input in the contact input field and displaying one or more contact names which match the input in the user interface screen.

The electronic device may be a mobile communication device such as a handheld communication device. The user interface screen may be for a communication application which in some embodiments could be a text messaging application for sending SMS MMS or other text messages an IM application chat application or a personal address book. In some embodiments the input in the contact input field is compared automatically to the personal address book and or the remote contact source to identify any matching contacts without user input. In some embodiments the input in the contact input field is compared automatically to the personal address book without user input however corresponding input is required to compare the input in the contact input field to the remote contact source to identify any matching contacts.

In some embodiments the application is an email messaging application the user interface screen being an email composition user interface screen and the contact input field being the address field of the email composition user interface screen wherein the remote contact source is only checked to determine if any contact names match the input in the contact input field in response to respective input. In some embodiments the identified contact names are displayed together in a pop up window which overlays at least a portion of the email composition user interface. In some embodiments the remote contact source is a directory service. In some embodiments two or more remote contact sources are searched the remote contact sources comprising i a global address book of a messaging server of a wireless connector system associated with the device and ii a directory service.

While the operations and have been described as being performed by the phone application or email application the local aspects of the lookup operations of these methods may be performed by a separate lookup module not shown stored in memory of the device while the other aspects of the method may be performed by the phone application or email application as the case may be. The lookup module may be part of the operating system in some embodiments. Moreover a single lookup module may be used by the operations and in some embodiments in particular a single lookup module may be used by both the phone application and email application . In such embodiments the lookup module provides centralized lookup capabilities for contact information for the mobile device . This may increase computational efficiency by reducing the processing required by the device at least in part by delegating responsibilities to aspects of the device software which are below the application level such as to the operating system .

While reference has been to example user interface screens it will be appreciated that additional fields and content may be added to the illustrated and described user interface screens in other embodiments of the present disclosure. Such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure.

While directory services such as forward and reverse lookup services are known these services have not been integrated with the functionality of a phone application to provide enhanced telephone call information or an email application to provide enhanced email information. Known prior art solutions require the user to exit the respective application open an Internet browser access a directory service by the browser search for the desired contact information review the search results and determine which records are relevant record the relevant contact information or commit it to memory which could be contact information for more than one individual or business and re open the application and then enter the information in the respective phone or email application. This solution is time consuming and requires many more steps and much more processing by the processor of the mobile device. In addition this solution requires the user to record the relevant contact information typically on paper or commit it to memory. This causes inconvenience on the part of the user and creates the possibility that the contact information may be lost forgotten or improperly recorded. Further still this solution does not present the user with any option to identity a user of an incoming call.

While some mobile devices such as GSM and CDMA enabled mobile phones can send name information with incoming calls this feature is a pay service which has an associated fee charged by the respective wireless and landline carriers of the incoming telephone number. The present disclosure provides a solution which can be used with all wireless voice networks as the contact information is obtained by accessing contact resources available over a wireless data network rather than relying on information contained in the radio layer which may be missing incorrect or incomplete and which may be used to verify and or supplement the information which is available via the radio layer and personal address book.

While the present disclosure is primarily described in terms of methods a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus such as a handheld electronic device including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods be it by way of hardware components software or any combination of the two or in any other manner. Moreover an article of manufacture for use with the apparatus such as a pre recorded storage device or other similar computer readable medium including program instructions recorded thereon or a computer data signal carrying computer readable program instructions may direct an apparatus to facilitate the practice of the described methods. It is understood that such apparatus articles of manufacture and computer data signals also come within the scope of the present disclosure.

The term computer readable medium as used herein means any medium which can store instructions for use by or execution by a computer or other computing device including but not limited to a portable computer diskette a hard disk drive HDD a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM or flash memory an optical disc such as a Compact Disc CD Digital Versatile Disc DVD or Blu ray Disc and a solid state storage device e.g. NAND flash or synchronous dynamic RAM SDRAM .

The various embodiments presented above are merely examples and are in no way meant to limit the scope of this disclosure. Variations of the innovations described herein will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art such variations being within the intended scope of the present application. In particular features from one or more of the above described embodiments may be selected to create alternative embodiments comprised of a sub combination of features which may not be explicitly described above. In addition features from one or more of the above described embodiments may be selected and combined to create alternative embodiments comprised of a combination of features which may not be explicitly described above. Features suitable for such combinations and sub combinations would be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art upon review of the present application as a whole. The subject matter described herein and in the recited claims intends to cover and embrace all suitable changes in technology.
