This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 61 449 816 filed on Mar. 7 2011 which provisional application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used imported sold and or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for U.S. Government purposes without the payment or any royalty thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to thermal indicating compositions and more specifically to such compositions containing one or more polydiacetylenes PDAs plus an oxide such as ZnO alloyed with a transition metal oxide such as ZrOand or TiO wherein such composition will respond repeatedly to thermal stimuli at a desired trigger temperature or wherein such compositions can be used to establish the cumulative time of exposure to a given thermal stimuli level based upon the resulting chromaticity thereof.

Materials that change color in response to external stimuli are known as chromic materials . Such chromic materials may radiate lose color or change properties induced by external stimuli. Different stimuli result in different responses in the material being affected. Chromic is a suffix that means color so chromic materials are named based on the stimuli energy affecting them for example 1 photochromic light or 2 thermochromic heat or 3 piezorochromic pressure or 4 solvatechromic liquid or 5 electrochromic electricity voltage conflicts.

An example of a commercial utilization of thermochromic paint was the paint introduced by Mattel Toy Corp. in the 1980 s applied to their Hot Wheels Color Racers and Color FX cars. These cars were painted with temperature sensitive paint which changed colors when placed in icy cold or warm tap water. These convention types of chromic paints change color upon exposure to certain temperatures then change back to their initial state and exhibit their original color once the stimuli i.e. temperature is removed in this example the temperature of the paint returns to room temperature i.e. reversibly.

Polydiacetylenes PDAs are a series of conjugated polymers which can undergo thermochromic transitions when exposed to temperature stimuli. This chromic change as illustrated in is caused by decrease of the conjugation length of the polymeric backbone due to strain induced by breaking of hydrogen bonds on the side groups. Therefore the thermochromic transition temperature is a function of the side groups on the polymeric backbone structures. By changing the side groups repeatable response to set stimuli are possible allowing these materials to function as sensors. There are several applications of such PDAs particularly in the form of coatings or films as chromic sensors for temperature chemical and stress. These polymers are tailored to create inks paints and coatings that will for example with an irreversible color change indicate that an object has been exposed to a high temperature so as to impact its functionality.

The monomers making up the PDAs are typically colorless and become increasingly colored with polymerization. Color in PDAs occurs as a result of to electronic transitions associated with the C C C C diacetylene backbone. Reversible changes in the color of the polymer occur due to molecular conformational changes resulting from modifications of the side chain packing ordering and orientation. This also means that these PDAs will undergo phase changes in two stable states the low temperature blue state and the high temperature red state. Complete thermochromic reversibility from the red to the blue phase is known to take place in PDAs where sufficiently strong hydrogen bonding interactions exist and are recovered on cooling from the high temperature red state. Recovery of the hydrogen bonding interactions can also be induced by the addition of specific organic molecules. It was therefore surprising that the addition of the inorganic compound ZnO to the PDAs induced chromatic reversibility and a large upshift of the chromatic transition temperature. By contrast it has been published that the addition of TiOand ZrOdid not affect the chromatic transition parameters.

Cost effective commercially available PDA monomers provide irreversible blue to red transitions at temperatures ranging from about 145 to about 172 degrees F. some examples being 

However there are applications where it is necessary to significantly increase these temperature ranges. An important example is what occurred during Desert Storm where the U.S. forces faced operational temperatures inside munitions containers exceeded 190 F. i.e. far in excess of the design limits of about 145 to about 165 F. for such munitions.

It is further critical to understand how long a particular munition has been subjected to elevated temperatures over the design limitation thereof as there are thermal stabilizer s provided in military munitions which are depleted over time by such exposure and as when such stabilizer s is depleted the munition can go critical. Current U.S. Army requirements would have such a means identify remember indicate when over any 3 days an aggregate of 2 hours exposure above 160 F. has occurred. Currently there is no simple economical means to know that such a period what temperature exposure has occurred with respect to fielded munitions.

Finally as munitions are stored for extended periods often greater than 20 years as well as being subjected to prolonged and repeated periods of transportation the use of powered devices and electronics is impractical for temperature monitoring. Further as stated above current PDAs are limited with respect to indicating high trigger temperatures and are not known to be capable of identifying a period of exposure to any given temperature level. Therefore having a non powered cost effective reliable and easily readable means to measure and indicate exposure to higher temperature levels and to the duration thereof of a munition is critical to understand if that munition has been compromised and may represent a deadly hazard.

The present invention addresses the above stated need by providing a PDA based thermochromic compositions that will trigger at higher temperatures than conventional PDA formulations and that will provide a chromaticity i.e. vividness or dullness of color indication at desired thermal bands. The present invention selectively uses one or a combination of PDAs therein which provide thermochromatic indications of temperature bands above the normal thermochromatic temperature of the PDAs themselves and which thermochromic compositions can be easily incorporated into paints inks and other coatings using known technology. Depending upon the cumulative time of exposure of the subject inventive thermochromic compositions to particular temperature band the resulting chromaticity of the inventive indicator formulation is indicative of the elapsed time of exposure to the particular thermal band. This resulting chromaticity of a thermal coating incorporating the inventive thermochromic composition is measurable and provides an empirical means to determine the cumulative thermal dwell or soak time at the particular temperature band. The subject PDA based thermochromic compositions including 

In a preferred embodiment the one or more polydiacetylenes are one or more of 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid or PCDA 10 12 tricosadiynoic acid or TCDA and 10 12 docosadiynedioic acid or Bis 1 .

Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

As mentioned above the present invention provides a thermal indicating composition comprising one or more polydiacetylenes and an oxide comprising ZnO which is alloyed with one or more metal oxides wherein the ZnO and metal oxide s used are in the form of micro scale or smaller particles. Such a composition is preferably incorporated into the form of an ink paint spray or other type of coating for application and use. Accordingly any conventional components required for the production of such coating may be included such as polymeric binders plasticizers UV absorbents etc.

Preferably the polydiacetylenes are present in an amount of 1 to 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the composition. More preferably the polydiacetylenes are present in an amount of 2.0 to 3.0 weight percent. An important factor in choosing the particular PDA or combination thereof is the phase reversibility desired. Chemical methods can be used to control the reversibility of thermochromic materials. In PDAs the aromatic interactions between the head groups can be modified to control the amount of reversibility of the polymers or even make the polymer irreversible if desired which is an object of the present invention. Strong head group interactions involving both H bonding and aromatic bonding lead to reversibility. Accordingly this issue is addressed by the present invention.

In a preferred embodiment the composition comprises one or more of CH CH C C C C CH COOH 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid also referred to as PCDA CH CH C C C C CH COOH 10 12 tricosadiynoic acid also referred to as TCDA and HOOC CH C C C C CH COOH 10 12 docosadiynedioic acid also referred to as Bis 1 . PCDA and TCDA were found to show a blue to red transition with brighter contrast in the polymer phase compared with Bis 1. PCDA and TCDA were therefore incorporated in most of the exemplary and test formulations prepared. However Bis 1 was added to either PCDA or TCDA in the higher temperature formulations to fine tune the transition temperature. It should be noted that the composition may also comprise unpolymerized diacetylene monomers.

With regards to the oxide alloy component of the composition the oxide alloy is present in an amount of from 0.01 to 2.0 weight percent and is defined by the following formula MetZnO wherein Met is a transition metal and x is a natural number from 0.2 to 0.6. Preferably Met is one or more of Zr and Ti. Preferably the oxide is nanoparticle ZnO having an average particle size of 20 400 nm more preferably 100 300 nm. Likewise the ZrOand or TiOare microsized particles preferably nanocrystalline particles with an average particle size of 100 300 nm.

With regards to the ZnO and oxide alloy containing same the present inventors found that ZnO uniquely forms a weak complex with acidic diacetylenes containing carboxylic groups such as 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid PCDA 10 12 docosadiynedioic acid DCDA and 10 12 tricosadiynoic acid TCDA mentioned above resulting in reversal of the chromatic blue to red transition. However it was unexpectedly discovered that this reversibility characteristic is slowed down by mixing the PDA with an alloy of ZnO with ZrO i.e. the oxide alloy claimed herein. Accordingly importantly it was unexpectedly discovered that combining an oxide alloy with one or more PDAs enables the mixed oxide PDA compositions of the present invention to function as elapsed time temperature indicators.

More specifically it should be noted that pure ZrOor TiOdoes not affect the irreversibility of the chromatic transition but thermally alloying ZrOwith ZnO was unexpectedly found to substantially slow down the rate of color change i.e. the conversion of the red to the blue phase. Initial x ray studies indicated no change in crystal structure of ZnO on thermal treatment with ZrO. The effect observed may therefore be due to an increase in particle size of ZnO with thermal treatment resulting in a decrease of the interaction of ZnO with the PDA molecule.

Synthesis of the polydiacetylene and alloyed ZnO ZrOcompositions of the present invention were carried out on a laboratory scale. A representative process involved the preparation of a PCDA ZnO and ZrOcomposition of the present invention. Wherein PCDA was purchased from GFS Chemicals Powell Ohio and nanocrystalline nc powders of ZnO and ZrOfrom Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. A mixture of nominal composition ZnZrOwas finely ground using a mortar and pestle transferred to a ceramic boat and heated in a furnace in air at 1100 C. for about 7 hrs. The heat treated ZnO ZrOmixture was then ground into a fine powder and mixed with PCDA monomer to prepare composites of PCDA by suspension in chloroform. The PCDA ZnO ZrOsuspension was sonicated in water bath at room temperature for about 30 min and drops of suspension were deposited on a glass slide followed by solvent evaporation to form thin films which were polymerized to blue phase Poly PCDA ZnO ZrOcomposites by irradiating with a 254 nm wavelength UV source.

In a preferred embodiment nanosized zinc oxide ZnO or a heat treated oxide alloy of ZnO and zirconium oxide ZrO is mixed into the thermal indicating coating composition to control the reversibility of the chromatic transition. In particular reversing of the red phase to the blue phase can be slowed down by using a mixed oxide of zinc and zirconium ZnO ZrO preferably thermally alloyed in compositions near ZrZnOwhere x 0.4. This interaction is believed to lead to the reversibility of the red phase and sizeable increase of the chromatic transition temperature in the poly PCDA ZnO nanocomposites.

To prove the cumulative time indication ability of formulations of the present invention a PDA was combined with an alloyed zinc and zirconium composition of the formula ZrZnO where x 0.4 i.e. ZrZnO which combination was mixed with a PMMA a polymer and a commercial white paint to form low 145 F. to 164 F. and mid temperature 165 F. to 184 F. cumulative time indicating formulations. The inventive composition used in the low range was 40.39 by weight exterior base commercial paint 2.83 diacetylene 10 12 tricosadiynoic acid 28.27 PMMA 10.11 PACBCS 14.13 PVA 4.40 Cerium Oxide and 0.08 mixture of oxides ZnO and ZrO 0.08 HAL hindered amine light stabilizer and diluted with acetone or similar solvent to 100 ml of paint. The inventive composition used in the mid temperature range was 40.39 by weight exterior base commercial paint 2.83 diacetylene 10 12 pentacosadiynoic acid 28.27 PMMA 10.11 PACBCS 14.13 PVA 4.40 Cerium Oxide and 0.08 mixture of oxides ZnO and ZrO 0.08 HAL and diluted with acetone or similar solvent to 100 ml of paint. The chromaticity values measured by an X Rite Model 518 Optical Densitometer X Rite Corporation Grand Rapids Mich. versus cumulative time in the low and mid temperature ranges are shown in . The chromaticity values obtained being proportional to how close the color is to either a gray or pure hue of the original color.

In contrast a high temperature range above 185 F. indictor was formed using a higher concentration of ZnO in the alloy with the ZrO because a shorter soak time at the elevated temperature is required. The composition comprising 40.39 by weight of exterior base commercial paint 2.83 mixture of diacetylenes 10 12 nanocosadiynoic acid and 10 12 docosadiynoic acid 28.27 PMMA 10.11 PACBCS 14.13 PVA 4.40 Cerium Oxide 0.08 mixture of oxides ZnO and ZrO and 0.08 HAL and diluted with acetone or similar solvent to 100 ml of paint. The chromaticity values at the high temperature range are shown in .

As mentioned above in addition to the two inventive components any additional paint coating spray additives may be included in the composition as long as they do not interfere with the thermal indicating characteristics of the composition. In a preferred embodiment the thermal indicating composition comprise one or more of polyurethane polyvinyl alcohol PVA polyvinyl pyrollidone PVP polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF and polymethylmethacrylate PMMA cellulose aluminum oxide titanium oxide fuming silica barium sulfate and cyclodextrin. PVA polyvinyl alcohol PVP polyvinyl pyrollidone or polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF to control the temperature of the chromatic blue to red transition via hydrogen bonding interactions. PMMA polymethylmethacrylate was added for uv protection of the formulation. A sprayable blend was fabricated by formulating the thermochromic PDA precursor mixed with PVA PVP or PVDF with a commercial white paint.

The transition temperature ranges of the thermal indicating compositions are mainly controlled by the types of polydiacetylenes PDAs included in the thermal indicating composition which change in each temperature band range . Further varying the proportions of the oxide alloy within the composition affects all the three factors i.e. irreversibility reversibility and indicating range. And each type of polydiacetylene interacts differently with the oxide alloy. Moreover the amount of alloy with respect to PDA significant affects the characteristics of the thermal indicating composition.

In summary it is believed that the type of polydiacetylene is what sets the initial temperature trigger ranges. Adding ZnO thereto causes reversibility by repairing the hydrogen bonds but by itself ZnO functions merely to enable reversible color change as well as an upshift in temperature trigger range when added in certain concentrations. However it was unexpectedly discovered that the addition of an oxide comprised of ZnO form of micro scale or smaller particles alloyed with a transition metal oxide such as ZrOand or TiO form of micro scale or smaller particles slows the ZnO induced reversibility and provides control over the soak times.

0.08 wt HAL hindered amine light stabilizer and diluted to 100 ml of paint used to stabilize the color of the paint.

Note Two classes of hindered amine light stabilizers HALS can be used to stabilize the color of the paints including i poly 6 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl amino s triazine 2 4 diyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl imino hexamethylene 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl imino HAL 1 and ii Bis 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl sebacate HAL 2 . Anti oxidant AO also used for stabilization was 1 5 8 12 Tetrakis 4 6 bis N butyl N 1 2 2 6 6 pentamethyl 4 iperidylamino 1 3 5 triazin 2 yl 1 5 8 12 tetraazadodecane. And U V protection and maintenance of the gloss of the paint were achieved by inclusion of PMMA PVA and PACBCS in the inventive paint formulation.

Generally preparation of a thermal indicating paint of the present invention as a coating paint was conducted in the following steps 1 an exterior paint is first diluted with methylene chloride via conventional methods such as ultra sonication for about 5 minutes 2 then the paint is further diluted by adding acetone thereto and mixing the paint and acetone 3 the polymers PMMA PVA and PACBCS are mixed into the diluted paint obtained above and then the paint is further thinned down by adding additional acetone and 5 finally the polydiacetylenes the oxide alloy such as ZnO ZrO as described above HALS and cerium oxide are added to the diluted and thinned paint and mixed therein using a magnetic stirrer for about two days or more to obtain satisfactory homogeneity and viscosity thereby forming a thermal indicating coating composition.

To form a thermal indicating test strip test plate about 10 ml of the thermal indicating coating composition as described above is spread on metal panels by using a paint sprayer. The solvent is then allowed to evaporate at room temperature. The resulting dried paint coating on the metal panels is then UV irradiated for a few minutes to cause the paint to enter the blue phase.
