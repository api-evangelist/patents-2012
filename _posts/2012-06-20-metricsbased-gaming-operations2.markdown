The present application is a divisional and claims the priority benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 283 854 filed Sep. 15 2008 and entitled Metrics Based Gaming Operations the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to electronic gaming. More specifically the present invention relates to metrics based gaming operations in electronic games.

As electronic gaming and networking technologies have become more advanced the complexity of games has increased accordingly. As a result there may be more complex storylines game play objectives missions and tasks capabilities associated with game play avatars and scoring. Scoring may occur and be weighted in various ways and likewise be determined in various categories or on an individual or team basis.

Many games are also network or community based with multiple players located around the country or around the world. Such games may involve the multiple players playing competitively and or cooperatively in teams amongst each other. Some games such as Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games MMORPGs may allow for hundreds if not thousands of players to interact with one other. While the ability to interact and compete with so many other players may increase user enjoyment and challenges certain complexities in dealing with so many players inevitably arise.

One example may involve evaluating players and their game play. A player may wish to evaluate other players for various reasons including team building community building or finding a mentor trainer. While some games allow users to view scoring information certain information associated with the scoring information may not be readily available or available in sufficient detail to allow for adequate evaluation of game play. For example a user may wish to find a player who is particularly strong in a certain aspect of the game. Where raw scores fail to convey such information a user may have to obtain such information by observing the game play of multiple candidates over multiple gaming sessions. Such an undertaking may be extremely time consuming inefficient and produce results that may very quickly become obsolete.

The significance of the aforementioned problems only increases as the complexity of electronic games increases. Modern video game systems are able to accommodate and provide for an increasing number of players and gaming statistics on each player. Thus it is becoming even more difficult and complex for game players to evaluate themselves and each other. Consequently it would enrich the video game experience to allow for complex analysis of game play information. Such information may also be used to customize gaming operations. There is therefore a need for methods and systems for metrics based gaming operations.

The present invention provides for methods and systems for metrics based gaming operations. Information concerning game play for each play may be received and stored. Such information may be used to generate certain metrics. The generated metrics in turn may be used to determine how to customize a game operation. Such game operations may include providing training to a player matching a player up with another player or with a team adjusting a game event etc.

Various embodiments of the present invention include methods for metrics based gaming operations. Such methods may include receiving information about game play in a game session providing the information to a database for storage generating metrics based on the received information determine instructions for customizing a game operation based on the game metrics and providing the instructions for use in customization. Some embodiments may further include determining a training curriculum for a player creating or adjusting training videos based on the determined curriculum and matching the player with a trainer based on the curriculum. Further embodiments may include matching the player with another player or group of other players for team play. Still further embodiments may include adjusting game events based on game metrics.

Some embodiments of the present invention include systems for metrics based gaming operations. Such systems may include a database for storing information concerning game play of a player in a game session a processor for generating metrics based on analysis of at least the stored information and for determining instructions for customizing a game operation based on the metrics and a network interface for providing information for use in customizing game operations. Further embodiments may include a repository for training videos a training video module a matching tool and a report generator.

Embodiments of the present invention may further include computer readable storage media having embodied thereon programs that when executed by a computer processor device perform methods for metrics based gaming operations.

The present invention provides for methods and systems for metrics based gaming operations. Information concerning game play for each player may be received and stored. Such information may be used to generate certain metrics. The generated metrics in turn may be used to determine how to customize a game operation. Such game operations may include providing training to a player matching a player up with another player or with a team or adjusting a game event in light of player capabilities.

The elements identified throughout are exemplary and may include various alternatives equivalents or derivations thereof. Various combinations of hardware software and computer executable instructions may be utilized. Program modules and engines may include routines programs objects components and data structures that effectuate the performance of particular tasks when executed by a processor which may be general purpose or application specific. Computer executable instructions and associated data structures stored in a computer readable medium represent examples of programming means for executing the steps of the methods and or implementing particular system configurations disclosed herein.

The client may be representative of a game console such as a PlayStation 3. Laptop computing devices a portable game device such as the PlayStation Portable a desktop computing device a cellular telephone or any other device capable of executing the network game and connecting to the network or alternatively an ad hoc network are further examples of client . The client may be identified by an identification number such as a client ID or an address mechanism such as an IP address. A user of the client may also sign on to a network with a user name and or password which may be temporarily or permanently associated with the client .

In some embodiments the server may host the network game . The clients may access the network game on the server via the network . The network game on the server may be the entire game a portion of the game data related to the game or simply a node allowing for the pass though observation and or collection of data related to the network game as the network game is played by users in the game community. The network game may be similarly organized at various clients e.g. portions of the game or game data related to the game . Network game may also be provided through for example a third party content library server.

It should be understood that the reference to a client and a server is merely for the convenience of understanding various embodiments of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in the context of a peer to peer network a client server network or within a peer group e.g. a specified group of peers . Therefore in some instances a client may function as a server and vice versa depending on the timing and the nature of a data exchange. For example various clients in a peer to peer network may each host a portion of a network game or data related to that network game and may send and receive the same. As such any reference to a client or a server is meant to be inclusive of operations performed by one or both computing entities unless specified otherwise by a specific limitation in the claims. In some instances a device with client server functionality may be referred to by the generic moniker network node computing node or network device. In that regard client and server may both be considered network or computing nodes or a network device.

The network game may include software that may be processed on or by the client and or that allows for or facilitates communication and data exchanges with the other clients and server via the network . The network may include for example the Internet. Other proprietary or closed networks may be used either exclusively or in conjunction with the Internet. Certain security protocols e.g. SSL or VPN or encryption methodologies may be used to ensure the security of data exchanges over network especially if the network is a publicly accessible network such as the Internet.

Users associated with each of the clients may interact with other users playing the network game . Accordingly the users at each of the clients may compete with one another despite not being physically present with one another or sharing a common gaming device or console.

In one exemplary embodiment the server may monitor the users playing the network game via the network . The clients may request data from the server such as information pertinent to the particular network game being played. Any type of communication exchange between the clients and the server is within the scope of the various embodiments of the present invention. Further in some embodiments more than one server may be connected to the network for the purpose of communicating with the clients . For example back up or redundancy servers as well as servers with particular tasks such as storing identification information or preferences related to a particular user as well as servers tasked with certain DRM advertising or payment responsibilities.

Memory may be specifically configured to include any type and or combination of databases and software modules in addition to being generally configured for storing information. Memory may reside on and be integrated with server or be housed separately. In the instance of memory being separately housed the various components of server may be communicatively coupled to and provide information to various other components of network .

Processor may be configured to execute various modules e.g. metric generation customization matching and training and retrieve data from various databases e.g. game play and metrics . Processor may be a multi core chip like the Cell Broadband Architecture Engine CBEA from Sony Computer Entertainment Toshiba and IBM the STI Alliance . The CBEA includes a Power Processing Element PPE and multiple e.g. eight Synergistic Processing Elements SPE . The PPE and SPEs are linked together by an internal high speed bus an Element Interconnect Bus EIB . The PlayStation 3 from Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. implements the CBEA.

Execution of certain modules may involve processor using information stored in a database of memory for various analyses undertaken by one or more other modules. A module or application as referenced in the present invention is inclusive of a collection of routines that perform various functions when executed. A module may be dynamically loaded and unloaded by hardware and device drivers as required. The modular software components described herein may also be incorporated as part of a larger software platform or integrated as part of an application specific component.

Game play database may be configured to store information concerning game play of a player during a game session. Such information may be defined by certain benchmarks or trigger events. These definitions may be determined by a game developer of a particular game a system or network administrator or a combination of the foregoing.

Information stored in game play database may be generated and or retrieved from a game utilizing extensible markup language XML or a variant thereof. Through the use of XML a game developer or system administrator e.g. an administrator for a network or service maintaining game metric information may define individual elements e.g. the aforementioned trigger events in game play. The developer or administrator may further allow an information processing system like that of to structure and manipulate that data as defined by the XML tags. Any variety of conforming processor and or validating processor modules may be implemented and executed with respect to processing well formed and or semantically valid sets of data in an effort to extract information for subsequent storage and metric generation.

The foregoing may pertain to games developed and authored with a metrics based game play system in mind. Embodiments of the present invention may further be implemented in certain legacy games. Legacy games may include those games that were developed and distributed prior to implementation of a metrics based game play system as described herein.

In one embodiment of legacy game title metric processing certain information or sets of information may be extracted with or without the like of XML tags and translated into data that may be of use to the presently described metrics based game play system. For example the particular adeptness at which a game player achieved certain tasks in a multi staged gaming environment may not be available in a legacy title e.g. how quickly were the goals achieved or how many lives did it take to achieve those goals . Notwithstanding data may be extracted or otherwise identified reflecting that the various stages were nevertheless completed. By completing these levels a determination may be made that a game player has some fundamental level of game play skill. Such an embodiment may be more easily implemented but the accuracy of game data derived may be in limited.

In a second embodiment a software patch or emulator may be introduced with respect to certain legacy titles. Through the patch or emulator more accurate game play data may be extracted for subsequent metric generation in that the patch or emulator acts as a bridge requesting and receiving legacy data and translating it into information that may be better understood by the presently disclosed invention. Such a patch or emulator application may be time consuming or difficult to author depending on the particularities of the legacy title.

Game play information may be generated at the client in and provided over communications network to game play database . Game play database may further include information from multiple players over multiple game sessions. In some embodiments game play database allow for indexing of such information so that particular information may be easily and quickly identified and retrieved by processor for subsequent analysis and or reporting. Retrieval of information from game play database by processor may occur in response to a request automatically or at periodic intervals.

Metric generation module is a software module that may be executed by processor in response to data provided by one or more databases in memory . Metric generation module upon execution by the processor may analyze data stored in game play database to generate various reporting metrics for a particular player particular team particular game particular game session and so forth. Such reporting metrics may be generated by metric generation module using various algorithms and formulas. Certain reporting metrics may be generated automatically. Alternatively some metrics may be generated upon request.

Metrics may also be generated by particular users through a software development kit SDK and or application programming interface API allowing for such interaction and integration with the server . In some embodiments metric generation module may allow for actual report generation so that specific reports concerning specific players teams and metrics as may be generated through execution of the metric generating module . These reports may be displayed to a user through a user interface generated by game server and that allows for user access and review of such metrics. The reporting metrics generated by metric generation module may further be provided to metrics database for storage and subsequent access and evaluation.

Processor may further execute customization module which provides instructions for adjusting various game operations based on certain metrics i.e. metrics stored in metrics database . Reporting metrics provided by metrics database or generated and accessed directly from metric generation module may indicate that a player has a certain weakness or strength in game play. For example the metrics may indicate that certain game events make a game too easy or too difficult for game players. Either situation can lessen enjoyment of any game. When metrics indicate that such a situation has arisen therefore customization module may generate instructions to adjust or avoid such a situation.

Customization module may allow for manipulation of certain portions of a game or game environment to address that weakness such that the game is not overly challenging whereby a player becomes frustrated and loses interest. Similarly the customization module may determine that a player has particular strengths or is adept at certain tasks and may increase the difficulty of certain game play operations so that the game player does not become bored and complacent.

For example a game player may be particularly adept in a fighter pilot game and engaging enemy targets one on one. Reporting metrics may reflect this ability through for example an indication of a high kill ratio or elimination of all enemy targets in a very short period of time. In response to the reporting metrics and analysis of the same the customization module may upon execution by processor temporarily introduce code or other game play variable recognizable and subject to processing by a video game such that targets now swarm the players whereby one on one interactions are left to a minimum and the game player is engaging at least two enemy targets at all times. Code may be access from a library of predefined customization code not shown generated on the fly or utilize code generated by third party developers. Fees may be imposed for use of the customizable game environment such as an ongoing subscription fee. Fees or other objects of valuable e.g. objects or weapons for use in an environment credits for micro transactions and so forth may be awarded to developers of code that allow for modification of a game play environment.

Processor may also execute a matching module in an effort to engage in team building and or team management. A player in response to reporting metrics generated by execution of the metric generation module and or retrieved from metrics database may be matched with other players or teams based on reported skill levels or abilities. Matching may occur with an aim toward matching similarly skilled players in head to head competition. Alternatively matching may occur with respect to creating teams or clans whereby players skills are complimentary to one another.

For example a game may require achieving certain tasks including overtaking a heavily guarded fortress. Overtaking said fortress may involve isolating the fortress from reinforcements taking out perimeter sentries and then eliminating the resistance inside the fortress. Each of those tasks may require particularized or specialized skills. For example a demolitions expert may be needed to destroy a bridge that serves as a route for arrival of reinforcements. A communications expert may likewise be needed to jam enemy communications calling for those reinforcements. A sniper may be needed to eliminate the perimeter sentries from a safe distance and then a skilled tactical assault team to forcefully take the facility.

A team composed solely of demolitions experts would likely fail in this mission. As such a team may be created through identifying a team the needs of that team with respect to manually generated requests e.g. the equivalent of a help wanted advertisement or alternatively a mercenary for hire or the particulars of a predefined mission and then matching game players that are available for joining a team and that possess the requisite skills needed by that team. Information concerning the abilities of players may be maintained in metrics database and information concerning the needs of a team may likewise be maintained in this or another database of information. Information concerning the particulars of a game environment e.g. the tasks requires to be executed may be maintained in game play database or another database of information. All of the aforementioned information may be taken into account when processor executes the matching module .

Execution of the matching module may likewise include routines for allowing players to meet up communicate with one another and determine if a team should be created. In this regard certain chat and or messaging capabilities may be built into the module or some other aspect of the system. Certain fees may be incurred to utilize the matching capabilities of the system.

Processor may also execute training module with an aim to creating a training curriculum for a user. Such a training curriculum may include creating a training video exercise adjusting an existing training video program in the instance that a user is given a series of videos for training or pairing a user with other users e.g. mentors and mentees to address game play weaknesses and or strengths. In the latter cases training module may operate in conjunction with the matching module to allow for such pairings.

Reporting metrics may indicate that a user is particularly weak with the use of a given weapon or object. In light of this information training module may select a video from a pre prepared library of training videos not shown such that a user may observe the video mimic and learn particular maneuvers and become more adept at use of the weapon. The video may be selected for the user or the user may be provided with a list of available videos in the library.

Reporting metrics may likewise indicate that a user is particularly adept with use of an object or weapon. Game play of that user utilizing that weapon or object may be recorded and maintained in a library for the purpose of creating a training video. The skilled user may be given the opportunity through a separate process to annotate that video with voice over textual instructions and or images of controller manipulation as they pertain to use of a weapon or object. U.S. patent publication Ser. No. 11 986 356 for a System and Method of Rendering Controller Information Ser. No. 11 986 551 for a System and Method of Providing Assistance Through Incentives Ser. No. 11 986 436 for a System and Method of Providing Assistance over a Network and Ser. No. 11 848 451 for Video Game Recording and Playback with Visual Display of Game Controller Manipulation are all illustrative in this regard with respect to training videos as they pertain to in game player activity and incorporated herein by reference.

The training module too may interoperate with matching module to allow for actual pairing of game players in a particular game environment. Thus instead of merely watching a video an unskilled player can interact with another player of superior skill in a one on one fashion in a mentor mentee relationship. The two players may meet in an on line networked game environment for an in person training session. The communications and messaging components referenced with respect to matching module may likewise be utilized in the context of the training module . Training module may also be used to respond to manual requests for assistance and or offers for the same. Certain incentives may be extended to mentors e.g. objects of value and or credits for micro transactions and costs incurred by mentees to utilize such functionality.

Network interface may be any of a variety of hardware and or software components configured to allow for communication between the host and other computing devices in the network. Network interface may include components for communicating over wired wireless and or Internet based communications networks. Network interface further allows for server to communicate with the others over network . Network interface may include for example a Network Interface Card NIC or a modem that permits communications over a variety of networks.

In step information concerning game play is received. During a game session a player may accumulate various statistics meet various benchmarks or trigger certain events related to game play. Some statistics benchmarks and trigger events may be provided as scoring information. Game play information may however include more than scoring information or win loss records. Depending on the game such information may include details on how a player fared in response to certain game events in certain game environments or while interacting with certain team members. Such information is generated during game play and may be communicated to server over communications network following or during the game session.

In step the game play information is stored. A game play database like game play database of may receive and store data concerning game play. Game play database may reside on server as illustrated in or be housed separately including by a third party or even the party generating game play data. In the instance that the server does not store the information game information received by server may be provided to one or more remote game play databases for storage.

In step a reporting metric is generated based on the game play information. Metric generation module may be executed by processor to access game play information e.g. from game play database and analyze such game play information to generate at least one metric for reporting. Some reporting metrics may be generated by metric generation module based on the game play information concerning a player from a game session. Some metrics may be further based on game play information concerning other players from multiple game sessions. In some instances a series of metrics e.g. different metrics for different tasks and even from different players and or in different games may be analyzed collectively and or combined to develop a more complex reporting metric reflective of various sub sets of information.

In step the reporting metrics are analyzed. Analysis of the metrics may indicate that a particular player is well versed in certain areas of game play or lacking in others. Analysis may also indicate that a particular player performs well with particular objects weapons or tools during the course of game play. Analysis may likewise indicate that a particular player performs well when working with other players players with certain skills and or under certain game conditions.

In step instructions for customizing game operations are determined. Instructions for such game operations may be determined by execution of the customization module by processor based on reporting metrics generated in step . Such instructions allow for various game operations to be customized to the ability and skill level of any particular player s . The instructions may be implemented on server and or provided over communications network to one or more clients . The instructions may be used to customize various game operations in ongoing or future game play of network game . In this way game play does not become too difficult or too easy for a player of the game.

It is noteworthy that any hardware platform suitable for performing the processing described herein is suitable for use with the invention. Computer readable storage media refer to any medium or media that participate in providing instructions to a CPU for execution. Such media can take many forms including but not limited to non volatile and volatile media such as optical or magnetic disks and dynamic memory respectively. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk a hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM disk digital video disk DVD any other optical medium RAM PROM EPROM a FLASHEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge.

Various forms of transmission media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a CPU for execution. A bus carries the data to system RAM from which a CPU retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by system RAM can optionally be stored on a fixed disk either before or after execution by a CPU.

While various embodiments have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. The descriptions are not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular forms set forth herein. Thus the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments.
