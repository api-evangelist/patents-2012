The present disclosure relates generally to techniques in devices configured for wireless communications and more particularly to techniques for use in negotiating a group owner GO in a Wi Fi Peer to Peer P2P network having a data connection to an external network e.g. the Internet .

A wireless communication device such as a portable wireless telephony device or smartphone may be configured to communicate in wireless communication networks. For example such a device may communicate in cellular telecommunications networks and or wireless local area networks WLANs in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards. Such a device may additionally communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example being certified as a Wi Fi Direct device in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification.

There is a need for efficiently controlling connectivity to such wireless networks in these and similar environments.

Techniques in a wireless device for use in negotiating a group owner with another wireless device for establishing a wireless Peer to Peer P2P network having a connection to an external network are described herein. The wireless device identifies whether it is operating for communications via a home network or a non home network. The wireless device sets its group owner intent value to an increased value when it is identified to be operating for communications via the home network or to a decreased value when it is identified to be operating for communications via a non home network. The wireless device then sends to the other wireless device a message which includes the group owner intent value for the wireless device. Once the group owner is determined the wireless device will connect with the other wireless device for establishing the wireless P2P network having the connection to the external network.

To illustrate one environment within which the techniques of the present disclosure may be practiced illustrates a wireless communication device which may communicate in a communication system . In the communication system wireless device may communicate with one or more wireless communication networks. For example wireless device may communicate with a wireless communication network which is a wireless local area network WLAN . Here wireless network and wireless device may operate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards.

In this example wireless network has a plurality of wireless access points APs and for wireless communications with wireless device . WLANs may be identified by a wireless device with use of a wireless network identifier which is communicated from the WLAN. The wireless network identifier may be for example a Set Service Identifier SSID or Homogeneous Extended SSID HESSID . In this example wireless network includes one or more servers a redirect server and a gateway . Server may provide data applications and or functionality for communication services for wireless device .

Wireless network may be a public Wi Fi hotspot for public use and include what may be referred to as a hotspot 2.0 Passpoint captive portal or walled garden. For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway is configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality as well as to permit or deny external access outside of wireless network to Internet . To do this gateway has a set of IP address filters which define a set of addresses that are permissible impermissible if any at all for access by devices. Access by a device depends on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization.

Typically when a request by a device in wireless network is made prior to proper authorization gateway is configured to redirect the request to redirect server . In response redirect server is configured to respond to wireless device to provide data for producing information e.g. Web page information which is rendered in a user interface UI e.g. a display of wireless device via a Web browser application. The information may solicit a user response. For example the information may solicit a user registration or login with user fields for entering a user name and or password information. Gateway identifies whether the received user response is sufficient e.g. whether the user name and password match prestored user name and password information whether the user payment is accepted whether the user acceptance is confirmed etc. . If the user response is deemed sufficient gateway permits access to the data applications and or functionality in or outside of wireless network .

Wireless device may also operate for communications in other different wireless networks such as a wireless network which is also a WLAN. In this example wireless network is a private communication network of an enterprise e.g. an organization a company a corporation etc. of wireless device . Similar to wireless network wireless network has a plurality of wireless APs and one or more servers and a gateway . For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway may be configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality offered via wireless network depending on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization. For devices attempting to access wireless network via Internet gateway is configured to permit or deny internal access to the data applications and or functionality in wireless network .

Such wireless networks e.g. infrastructure WLANs may provide or allow access to various data and communication services to its terminals. For example the wireless networks may provide for communication access to Internet via the Web browser application or voice telephony communication service with use of Voice over IP VoIP communication or other communication services. For push type data or message synchronization services for example wireless device may be enabled to maintain data synchronization with a server e.g. server for user data of an application associated with a user account. The application of wireless device and the server may be or include for example an electronic mail e mail application program for the communication of e mail messages.

Also wireless device may be additionally configured to access communication services via a Public Land Wireless Network PLMN e.g. a cellular telecommunications network other type of wireless wide area network WWAN . PLMN includes a core network a plurality of base station controllers such as a base station controller BSC coupled to core network and a plurality of base stations such as a base station BS and a base station coupled to associated BSCs . Core network BSC and BS operate in a conventional fashion as well documented. Other PLMNs in the environment have a similar or the same architecture as PLMN . For communication with PLMNs wireless device may be configured in accordance with one or more cellular telecommunication standards such as Global Systems for Mobile GSM and or General Packet Radio Service GPRS technologies. Such wireless device may additionally or alternatively operate in accordance with other such cellular standards such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Long Term Evolution LTE or EVolution Data Only EV DO for CDMA technologies as a few examples or even wireless broadband standards such as IEEE 802.16 WiMAX IEEE 802.20 and IEEE 802.22.

In addition to being operative for communications with infrastructure WLANs e.g. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLANs wireless device additionally or alternatively communicates using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device. Accordingly illustrating further in wireless device and one or more other wireless devices and in may be operative to establish Wi Fi P2P network connections with each other in a Wi Fi P2P network. Here one of the communicate devices may be configured to enter into an AP mode of operation so that other communication devices may associate with them for direct RF communications therebetween. An AP mode of operation which may be referred to as a wireless AP mode or the like provides a benefit due to the high data rates available over WLAN links. Here again data may be communicated directly between the wireless devices without the data traversing any wireless network infrastructure where one of the devices is set to operate or serve as an AP switching operation from as an end terminal and the other device operates as an end terminal to associate and connect with the AP i.e. wireless device operating as an AP for communications. Wireless device may operate such that when in the AP mode of operation with other communication devices and it also operates as a client with another AP.

In the wireless device generally operates to perform functions for group formation and specifically for negotiating a group owner in a P2P network. The group formation may be for the purpose of communicating over a data connection via a wireless network e.g. a cellular network to an external network e.g. the Internet . For example the group formation may be for communications with a mobile hotspot for communications via the Internet.

Beginning at a start block the wireless device produces and sends a group owner negotiation request to another wireless device step of . The group owner negotiation request includes a group owner intent value or intent of the wireless device to become the group owner in the Wi Fi P2P network. The group owner intent value or intent may be a value within a range of 0 to 15. The group owner intent value may be determined based on the flowchart of which is described later below.

The other wireless device receives this group owner negotiation request and in response produces and sends to the wireless device a group owner negotiation response. Accordingly the wireless device receives a group owner negotiation response from the other wireless device step of . The group owner negotiation response includes a group owner intent value or intent of the other wireless device to become the group owner in the Wi Fi P2P network. The group owner intent value or intent may be a value within a range of 0 to 15. Again the group owner intent value may be determined based on the flowchart of which is described later below.

The group owner is then determined based on the group owner intent values of the wireless devices. For example the group owner may be determined to be the wireless device having a group owner intent value that is greater than the group owner intent value of the other wireless device.

The wireless device then produces and sends a group owner confirmation to the wireless device step of . Thereafter the wireless devices may establish a Wi Fi P2P network where one of the devices is the group owner with external connectivity step of . The wireless devices may communicate over the data connection via the wireless network to the external network. Here the group owner may operate as a mobile hotspot so that the one or more other wireless devices may access the Internet via the wireless network.

With respect to generally the wireless device operates to perform functions for group formation and specifically for determining its group owner intent value for the negotiation of a group owner in a Wi Fi P2P network. The group owner intent value or intent may be a value within a range of 0 to 15. Upon group formation the wireless device will communicate in the network with use of its first wireless transceiver e.g. its WLAN transceiver operative in accordance with IEEE 802.11 . If the wireless device becomes the group owner it will operate to route data communications for the one or more other connected wireless devices over a data connection established via a wireless network with use of its second wireless transceiver e.g. its cellular transceiver in communications with a cellular telecommunications network .

Beginning at a start block of the wireless device identifies whether the request for the group formation indicates or relates to a need a desire or a preference to have a data connection to an external network step of . The external network may be any suitable communication network that is external to the network being formed. The external network may be a public communication network such as the Internet. The data connection may involve packet data communications where the identification in step may involve identifying whether the wireless device has a packet data service established with the wireless network. The need desire or preference to have the data connection to the external network may be explicit or implicit. The request may for example indicate a need desire or preference to establish communications with a mobile hotspot for communications via the Internet.

If the connection to the external network is not needed desired or preferred as identified in step then processing continues based on other considerations step of where steps of are bypassed.

Otherwise if the data connection to the external network is needed desired or preferred as identified at step then the wireless device identifies whether it currently has or is able to currently obtain a data connection with a wireless network step of . The wireless network may be a cellular telecommunications network such as a public land mobile network PLMN or the like. The wireless device may communicate with a wireless network with use of a second wireless transceiver which may be a cellular radio transceiver for communications with a cellular telecommunications network.

If the wireless device identifies that it does not have or is unable to obtain a data connection with a wireless network in step then the wireless device sets its group owner intent value to zero 0 step of . In this case the wireless device may not be registered with any suitable wireless network for data service. Accordingly the wireless device will set its group owner intent value to zero 0 because it will not be able to serve as the group owner for the purposes of routing data communications for one or more other wireless devices over a data connection via a wireless network. The wireless device may not currently have or be unable to currently obtain a data connection with a wireless network for a variety of different reasons such as being out of coverage with any suitable wireless network not having a valid subscription for services with any suitable wireless network not having a second wireless transceiver for communications via a wireless network etc.

If the wireless device identifies that it does currently have or is able to currently obtain a data connection with a wireless network in step e.g. it is currently registered with a suitable wireless network for data service then the wireless device identifies whether the wireless network is a home network or a non home network step of . A home network may be a network that is owned and or affiliated with e.g. through agreement or contract the carrier for which the user has obtained a subscription for communication services. A non home network is not a home network and may be or be referred to as a visiting network. A home network may have preferred or better services than those made available by a non home network and or may make services available at a cost that is lower than the cost of the services in a non home network e.g. where the wireless device is roaming .

In this step the wireless device may maintain storage of a list of one or more home network identifiers in its memory. The wireless device may receive a network identifier which identifies the wireless network with which it is registered and compare this received network identifier with the one or more home network identifiers stored in memory. If there is a match between the received network identifier and any one of the home network identifiers then the wireless network is identified to be its home network. Otherwise if the received network identifier fails to match any of its home network identifiers then the wireless network is identified to be a non home network.

Additionally or alternatively the wireless device may maintain in its memory an indicator of whether or not it is currently registered with a home network. Upon registration with a wireless network the wireless device will set the indicator in memory as non home network e.g. set bit indicator to 0 or home network e.g. set bit indicator to 1 . In step the wireless device merely tests the stored indicator to identify whether the current wireless network is a home network or a non home network.

The network identifiers may be or include network identifiers of cellular networks or PLMNs which are identified by Mobile Country Code MCC and Mobile Network Code MNC pairs for example. Here the one or more home networks may be stored in memory as one or more Home PLMN HPLMN identifiers for example in an HPLMN list. Also non home networks may be any networks not identified as the stored HPLMN identifier or in the HPLMN list and or be identified in a preferred PLMN PPLMN list of the wireless device.

If the wireless device identifies that the wireless network is a home network step of then the wireless device may set its group owner intent value to an increased value step of . On the other hand if the wireless device identifies that the wireless network is a non home network in step then the wireless device may set its group owner intent value to decreased value step of .

Step may involve increasing a previous nominally set value to obtain an increased value whereas step may involve decreasing the previous nominally set value to obtain a decreased value. Alternatively step may involve increasing the previous nominally set value to obtain an increased value whereas step may involve maintaining the same previous nominally set value as previously set. Also alternatively step may involve maintaining the same previous nominally set value as previously set whereas step may involve decreasing the previous nominally set value to obtain a decreased value. In any case the resulting value from step operating in home network will be greater than the resulting value set in step operating in non home network where the wireless device indicates a greater intent to become the group owner when operating in a home network.

The wireless device then sends to the other wireless device a message which includes its group owner intent value see e.g. the discussion in relation to . For example the group owner intent value may be included as a Peer to Peer P2P information element IE in a group owner negotiation request e.g. see step of or a group owner negotiation request e.g. see step of .

The group owner will be determined or selected based on the group owner intent values of the wireless devices. For example the group owner may be selected by selecting as the group owner the wireless device having a group owner intent value that is greater than the group owner intent value of the other wireless device. The determination and selection of the group owner may be performed by one of the wireless devices e.g. the wireless device which responds to the group owner negotiation request . After the group owner is selected the Wi Fi P2P network having the connection to the external network is established. The group owner may serve as a mobile hotspot to route data communications for the one or more other connected wireless devices to access the Internet over the data connection via the wireless network.

Thus techniques in a wireless device for use in negotiating a group owner with another wireless device for establishing a wireless peer to peer P2P network having a connection to an external network have been described. The wireless device identifies whether it is operating for communications via a home network or a non home network. The wireless device sets its group owner intent value to an increased value when it is identified to be operating for communications via a home network or to a decreased value when it is identified to be operating for a non home network e.g. a visiting network . The wireless device then sends to the other wireless device a message which includes the group owner intent value for the wireless device. Once the group owner is determined the wireless device will connect with the other wireless device for establishing the wireless P2P network having the connection to the external network.
