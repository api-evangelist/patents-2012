U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 426 764 filed on even date herewith titled EVENT MONITORING IN A SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY OBTAINING AND MANAGING PHYSICAL LAYER INFORMATION USING A RELIABLE PACKET BASED COMMUNICATION which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Communication networks typically include numerous logical communication links between various items of equipment. Often a single logical communication link is implemented using several pieces of physical communication media. For example a logical communication link between a computer and an inter networking device such as a hub or router can be implemented as follows. A first cable connects the computer to a jack mounted in a wall. A second cable connects the wall mounted jack to a port of a patch panel and a third cable connects the inter networking device to another port of a patch panel. A patch cord cross connects the two together. In other words a single logical communication link is often implemented using several segments of physical communication media.

A network or enterprise management system generally referred to here as a network management system or NMS is typically aware of the logical communication links that exist in a network but typically does not have information about the specific physical layer media that are used to implement the logical communication links. Indeed NMS systems typically do not have the ability to display or otherwise provide information about how logical communication links are implemented at the physical layer level.

Physical layer management PLM systems do exist. However existing PLM systems are typically designed to facilitate the adding changing and removing of cross connections at a particular patch panel or a set of patch panels at a given location. Generally such PLM systems include functionality to track what is connected to each port of a patch panel trace connections that are made using a patch panel and provide visual indications to a user at a patch panel. However such PLM systems are typically patch panel centric in that they are focused on helping a technician correctly add change or remove cross connections at a patch panel. Any intelligence included in or coupled to the patch panel is typically only designed to facilitate making accurate cross connections at the patch panel and troubleshooting related problems for example by detecting whether a patch cord is inserted into a given port and or by determining which ports are coupled to one another using a patch cord .

Moreover any information that such PLM systems collect is typically only used within the PLM systems. In other words the collections of information that such PLM systems maintain are logical islands that are not used at the application layer level by other systems. Though such PLM systems are sometimes connected to other networks for example connected to local area networks or the Internet such network connections are typically only used to enable a user to remotely access the PLM systems. That is a user remotely accesses the PLM related application layer functionality that resides in the PLM system itself using the external network connection but external systems or networks typically do not themselves include any application layer functionality that makes use of any of the physical layer related information that resides in the PLM system.

One exemplary embodiment is directed to a connector assembly. The connector assembly comprises a port having a media interface configured to interface with a storage device interface of a connector. The connector is attached to a segment of physical communication media. The connector also includes a storage device. The connector assembly also comprises a programmable processor configured to execute software that stores information to the storage device using a plurality of redundant storage operations by which a plurality of copies of the information is sequentially stored in the storage device.

Each segment of physical communication media is attached to a respective port . Each port is used to connect two or more segments of physical communication media to one another for example to implement a portion of a logical communication link . Examples of connector assemblies include for example rack mounted connector assemblies such as patch panels distribution units and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media wall mounted connector assemblies such as boxes jacks outlets and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media and inter networking devices such as switches routers hubs repeaters gateways and access points .

At least some of the connector assemblies are designed for use with segments of physical communication media that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. The identifier and attribute information is stored in or on the segment of physical communication media in a manner that enables the stored information when the segment is attached to a port to be read by a programmable processor associated with the connector assembly . Examples of information that can be stored in or on a segment of physical communication media include without limitation an identifier that uniquely identifies that particular segment of physical communication media similar to an ETHERNET Media Access Control MAC address but associated with the physical communication media and or connector attached to the physical communication media a part number a plug or other connector type a cable or fiber type and length a serial number a cable polarity a date of manufacture a manufacturing lot number information about one or more visual attributes of physical communication media or a connector attached to the physical communication media such as information about the color or shape of the physical communication media or connector or an image of the physical communication media or connector and other information used by an Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system or inventory control system. In other embodiments alternate or additional data is stored in or on the media segments. For example testing or media quality or performance information can be stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. The testing or media quality or performance information for example can be the results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured.

Also as noted below in some embodiments the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated. For example the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated to include the results of testing that is performed when a segment of physical media is installed or otherwise checked. In another example such testing information is supplied to an aggregation point and stored in a data store maintained by the aggregation point both of which are described below . In another example the information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media includes a count of the number of times that a connector not shown attached to a segment of physical communication media has been inserted into port . In such an example the count stored in or on the segment of physical communication media is updated each time the connector is inserted into port . This insertion count value can be used for example for warranty purposes for example to determine if the connector has been inserted more than the number of times specified in the warranty or for security purposes for example to detect unauthorized insertions of the physical communication media .

In the particular embodiment shown in each of the ports of the connector assemblies comprises a respective media interface via which the respective programmable processor is able to determine if a physical communication media segment is attached to that port and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached segment if such information is stored therein or thereon . The programmable processor associated with each connector assembly is communicatively coupled to each of the media interfaces using a suitable bus or other interconnect not shown .

In the particular embodiment shown in four exemplary types of connector assembly configurations are shown. In the first connector assembly configuration shown in each connector assembly includes its own respective programmable processor and its own respective network interface that is used to communicatively couple that connector assembly to an Internet Protocol IP network .

In the second type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are physically located near each other for example in a bay or equipment closet . Each of the connector assemblies in the group includes its own respective programmable processor . However in the second connector assembly configuration some of the connector assemblies referred to here as interfaced connector assemblies include their own respective network interfaces while some of the connector assemblies referred to here as non interfaced connector assemblies do not. The non interfaced connector assemblies are communicatively coupled to one or more of the interfaced connector assemblies in the group via local connections. In this way the non interfaced connector assemblies are communicatively coupled to the IP network via the network interface included in one or more of the interfaced connector assemblies in the group. In the second type of connector assembly configuration the total number of network interfaces used to couple the connector assemblies to the IP network can be reduced. Moreover in the particular embodiment shown in the non interfaced connector assemblies are connected to the interfaced connector assembly using a daisy chain topology though other topologies can be used in other implementations and embodiments .

In the third type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are physically located near each other for example within a bay or equipment closet . Some of the connector assemblies in the group also referred to here as master connector assemblies include both their own programmable processors and network interfaces while some of the connector assemblies also referred to here as slave connector assemblies do not include their own programmable processors or network interfaces . Each of the slave connector assemblies is communicatively coupled to one or more of the master connector assemblies in the group via one or more local connections. The programmable processor in each of the master connector assemblies is able to carry out the processing described below for both the master connector assembly of which it is a part and any slave connector assemblies to which the master connector assembly is connected via the local connections. As a result the cost associated with the slave connector assemblies can be reduced. In the particular embodiment shown in the slave connector assemblies are connected to a master connector assembly in a star topology though other topologies can be used in other implementations and embodiments .

Each programmable processor is configured to execute software or firmware shown in that causes the programmable processor to carry out various functions described below. The software comprises program instructions that are stored or otherwise embodied on an appropriate non transitory storage medium or media such as flash or other non volatile memory magnetic disc drives and or optical disc drives . At least a portion of the program instructions are read from the storage medium by the programmable processor for execution thereby. The storage medium on or in which the program instructions are embodied is also referred to here as a program product . Although the storage medium is shown in as being included in and local to the connector assembly it is to be understood that remote storage media for example storage media that are accessible over a network or communication link and or removable media can also be used. Each connector assembly also includes suitable memory not shown that is coupled to the programmable processor for storing program instructions and data. In general the programmable processor and the software executing thereon determines if a physical communication media segment is attached to a port with which that processor is associated and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segment if the segment includes such information stored therein or thereon using the associated media interface .

As shown in in the first second and third configurations and each programmable processor is also configured to communicate physical layer information to devices that are coupled to the IP network . The physical layer information PLI includes information about the connector assemblies associated with that programmable processor also referred to here as device information as well as information about any segments of physical media attached to the ports of those connector assemblies also referred to here as media information The device information includes for example an identifier for each connector assembly a type identifier that identifies the connector assembly s type and port priority information that associates a priority level with each port. The media information includes identity and attribute information that the programmable processor has read from attached physical media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on it. The media information may also include information about physical communication media that does not have identifier or attribute information stored in or on it. This latter type of media information can be manually input at the time the associated physical media segments are attached to the connector assembly for example using a management application executing on the programmable processor that enables a user to configure and monitor the connector assembly .

In the fourth type of connector assembly configuration a group of connector assemblies are housed within a common chassis or other enclosure. Each of the connector assemblies in the configuration includes their own programmable processors . In the context of this configuration the programmable processors in each of the connector assemblies are slave processors . Each of the slave programmable processor is also communicatively coupled to a common master programmable processor for example over a backplane included in the chassis or enclosure . The master programmable processor is coupled to a network interface that is used to communicatively couple the master programmable processor to the IP network . In this configuration each slave programmable processor is configured to determine if physical communication media segments are attached to its port and to read the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segments if the attached segments have such information stored therein or thereon using the associated media interfaces . This information is communicated from the slave programmable processor in each of the connector assemblies in the chassis to the master processor . The master processor is configured to handle the processing associated with communicating the physical layer information read from by the slave processors to devices that are coupled to the IP network .

The system includes functionality that enables the physical layer information that the connector assemblies capture to be used by application layer functionality outside of the traditional physical layer management application domain. That is the physical layer information is not retained in a PLM island used only for PLM purposes but is instead made available to other applications. In the particular embodiment shown in the system includes an aggregation point that is communicatively coupled to the connector assemblies via the IP network .

The aggregation point includes functionality that obtains physical layer information from the connector assemblies and other devices and stores the physical layer information in a data store.

The aggregation point can be used to receive physical layer information from various types of connector assemblies that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. Examples of such connector assemblies are noted above. Also the aggregation point can also be used to receive physical layer information from other types of devices that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media. Examples of such devices include end user devices such as computers peripherals such as printers copiers storage devices and scanners and IP telephones that include functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media.

The aggregation point can also be used to obtain other types of physical layer information. For example in this embodiment the aggregation point also obtains information about physical communication media segments that is not otherwise automatically communicated to an aggregation point . One example of such information is information about non connectorized physical communication media segments that do not otherwise have information stored in or on them that are attached to a connector assembly including for example information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network as well as media information about the segment . Another example of such information is information about physical communication media segments that are connected to devices that are not able to read media information that is stored in or on the media segments that are attached to their ports and or that are not able to communicate such information to the aggregation point for example because such devices do not include such functionality because such devices are used with media segments that do not have media information stored in or on them and or because bandwidth is not available for communicating such information to the aggregation point . In this example the information can include for example information about the devices themselves such as the devices MAC addresses and IP addresses if assigned to such devices information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network for example other connector assemblies and information about the physical media attached to the ports of the devices. This information can be provided to the aggregation point for example by manually entering such information into a file such as a spreadsheet and then uploading the file to the aggregation point for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. Such information can also for example be directly entered using a user interface provided by the aggregation point for example using a web browser .

The aggregation point can also obtain information about the layout of the building or buildings in which the network is deployed as well as information indicating where each connector assembly physical media segment and inter networking device is located within the building. This information can be for example manually entered and verified for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. In one implementation such location information includes an X Y and Z location for each port or other termination point for each physical communication media segment for example X Y and Z location information of the type specified in the ANSI TIA EIA 606 A Standard Administration Standard For The Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure .

The aggregation point can obtain and maintain testing media quality or performance information relating to the various segments of physical communication media that exist in the network. The testing media quality or performance information for example can be results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured and or when testing is performed when a particular segment of media is installed or otherwise checked.

The aggregation point also includes functionality that provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point . This access can include retrieving information from the aggregation point as well as supplying information to the aggregation point . In this embodiment the aggregation point is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the PLI maintained by the access point . Because the aggregation point aggregates PLI from the relevant devices on the IP network and provides external devices and entities with access to such PLI the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the IP network that provide PLI nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The aggregation point in the embodiment shown in implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API. Also in those embodiments where the connector assemblies include one or more light emitting diodes LEDs for example where each port has an associated LED the API and aggregation point can include functionality that enables application layer functionality to change the state of such LEDs using the API.

For example as shown in a network management system NMS includes physical layer information PLI functionality that is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and provide it to the other parts of the NMS for use thereby. The NMS uses the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more network management functions for example as described below . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in the PLI functionality of the NMS retrieves physical layer information from the aggregation point using the API implemented by the aggregation point . The NMS communicates with the aggregation point over the IP network .

As shown in an application executing on a computer can also use the API implemented by the aggregation point to access the PLI information maintained by the aggregation point for example to retrieve such information from the aggregation point and or to supply such information to the aggregation point . The computer is coupled to the IP network and accesses the aggregation point over the IP network .

In the embodiment shown in one or more inter networking devices used to implement the IP network include physical layer information PLI functionality . The PLI functionality of the inter networking device is configured to retrieve physical layer information from the aggregation point and use the retrieved physical layer information to perform one or more inter networking functions. Examples of inter networking functions include Layer 1 Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the OSI model inter networking functions such as the routing switching repeating bridging and grooming of communication traffic that is received at the inter networking device. In one implementation of such an embodiment the PLI functionality uses the API implemented by the aggregation point to communicate with the aggregation point .

The PLI functionality included in the inter networking device can also be used to capture physical layer information associated with the inter network device and the physical communication media attached to it and communicate the captured physical layer information to the aggregation point . Such information can be provided to the aggregation point using the API or by using the protocols that are used to communicate with the connector assemblies .

The aggregation point can be implemented on a standalone network node for example a standalone computer running appropriate software or can be integrated along with other network functionality for example integrated with an element management system or network management system or other network server or network element . Moreover the functionality of the aggregation point can be distributed across many nodes and devices in the network and or implemented for example in a hierarchical manner for example with many levels of aggregation points .

Moreover the aggregation point and the connector assemblies are configured so that the aggregation point can automatically discover and connect with devices that provide PLI to an aggregation point such as the connector assemblies and inter network device that are on the network . In this way when devices that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point such as a connector assembly or an inter networking device are coupled to the IP network an aggregation point is able to automatically discover the connector assembly and start aggregating physical layer information for that connector assembly without requiring the person installing the connector assembly to have knowledge of the aggregation points that are on the IP network . Similarly when an aggregation point is coupled to the IP network the aggregation point is able to automatically discover and interact with devices that are capable of providing PLI to an aggregation point without requiring the person installing the aggregation point to have knowledge of the devices that are on the IP network . Thus the physical layer information resources described here can be easily integrated into the IP network .

The IP network can include one or more local area networks and or wide area networks including for example the Internet . As a result the aggregation point NMS and computer need not be located at the same site as each other or at the same site as the connector assemblies or the inter networking devices .

Various conventional IP networking techniques can be used in deploying the system of . For example conventional security protocols can be used to secure communications if they are communicated over a public or otherwise unsecure communication channel such as the Internet or over a wireless communication link .

In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector assembly each port of each connector assembly and each media segment is individually addressable. Where IP addresses are used to individually address each connector assembly a virtual private network VPN dedicated for use with the various connector assemblies can be used to segregate the IP addresses used for the connector assemblies from the main IP address space that is used in the IP network .

Also power can be supplied to the connector assemblies using conventional Power over Ethernet techniques specified in the IEEE 802.3af standard which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In such an implementation a power hub or other power supplying device located near or incorporated into an inter networking device that is coupled to each connector assembly injects DC power onto one or more of the wires also referred to here as the power wires included in the copper twisted pair cable used to connect each connector assembly to the associated inter networking device. The interface in the connector assembly picks the injected DC power off of the power wires and uses the picked off power to power the active components of that connector assembly . In the second and third connector assembly configurations and some of the connector assemblies are not directly connected to the IP network and therefore are unable to receive power directly from the power wires. These connector assemblies receive power from the connector assemblies that are directly connected to the IP network via the local connections that communicatively couple such connector assemblies to one another. In the fourth configuration the interface picks the injected DC power off of the power wires and supplies power to the master processor and each of the slave processors over the backplane.

In the particular embodiment shown in the system also supports conventional physical layer management PLM operations such as the tracking of moves adds and changes of the segments of physical media that are attached to the ports of the connector assemblies and providing assistance with carrying out moves adds and changes. PLI provided by the aggregation point can be used to improve upon conventional guided MAC processes. For example information about the location of the port and the visual appearance for example the color or shape of the relevant physical media segment or connector attached thereto can be communicated to a technician to assist the technician in carrying out a move add or change. This information can be communicated to a computer or smartphone used by the technician. Moreover the PLI functionality that resides in the system can also be used to verify that a particular MAC was properly carried out by checking that the expected physical media segment is located in the expected port . If that is not the case an alert can be sent to the technician so that the technician can correct the issue.

The PLM functionality included in the system can also support conventional techniques for guiding the technician in carrying out a MAC for example by illuminating one or more light emitting diodes LEDs to direct a technician to a particular connector assembly and or to a particular port or by displaying messages on a liquid crystal display LCD included on or near the connector assemblies .

Other PLM functions include keeping historical logs about the media connected to the connector assembly. In the embodiment shown in the aggregation point includes PLM functionality that implements such PLM functions. The PLM functionality does this using the physical layer information that is maintained at the aggregation point .

The IP network is typically implemented using one or more inter networking devices. As noted above an inter networking device is a type of connector assembly and a particular implementation of an inter networking device is referenced separately in for ease of explanation only . Generally an inter networking device can be configured to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its ports and to communicate the media information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the inter networking device itself to an aggregation point like any other connector assembly described here.

In addition to connector assemblies the techniques described here for reading media information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media can be used in one or more end nodes of the IP network . For example computers such as laptops servers desktop computers or special purpose computing devices such as IP telephones IP multi media appliances and storage devices can be configured to read media information that is stored in or on the segments of physical communication media that are attached to their ports and to communicate the media information they read from the attached segments of media as well as information about the devices themselves to an aggregation point as described here.

In one implementation of the system shown in the ports of each connector assembly are used to implement the IP network over which each connector assembly communicates physical layer information associated with that connector assembly . In such an implementation such physical layer information is communicated over the IP network just like any other data that is communicated over the IP network . As noted below the media interface determines if a physical communication media segment is attached to the corresponding port and if one is reads the identifier and attribute information stored in or on the attached segment if such information is stored therein or thereon without affecting the normal data signals that pass through that port . Indeed such physical layer information may actually pass through one or more of the ports of connector assemblies in the course of being communicated to and or from a connector assembly aggregation point network management system and or computer . By using the IP network to communicate physical layer information pertaining to it a separate network need not be provided and maintained in order to communicate such physical layer information. However in other implementations and embodiments the physical layer information described above is communicated using a network that is separate from the network to which such physical layer information pertains.

Each port comprises a first attachment point and a second attachment point . The first attachment point is used to attach a first segment of physical communication media to the port and the second attachment point is used to attach a second segment of physical communication media to the port .

In the particular embodiment shown in the first attachment point is located near the rear of the connector assembly. As a consequence the first attachment point and the first segment of physical media attached thereto are also referred to here as the rear attachment point and the rear media segment respectively. Also in this embodiment the rear attachment point is configured to attach the rear media segment to the port in a semi permanent manner. As used herein a semi permanent attachment is one that is designed to be changed relatively infrequently if ever. This is also referred to sometimes as a one time connection. Examples of suitable rear connectors include punch down blocks in the case of copper physical media and fiber adapters fiber splice points and fiber termination points in the case of optical physical media .

In the embodiment shown in the second attachment point is located near the front of the connector assembly . As a consequence the second attachment point and the second segment of physical media are also referred to here as the front attachment point and the front media segment respectively. In the embodiment shown in the front attachment point for each port is designed for use with connectorized front media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. As used herein a connectorized media segment is a segment of physical communication media that includes a connector at at least one end of the segment. The front attachment point is implemented using a suitable connector or adapter that mates with the corresponding connector on the end of the front media segment . The connector is used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the front media segment to the port . Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible modular jacks or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors or adapters . The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Each port communicatively couples the respective rear attachment point to the respective front attachment point . As a result a rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point is communicatively coupled to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point . In one implementation each port is designed for use with a rear media segment and a front media segment that comprise the same type of physical communication media in which case each port communicatively couples any rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point at the physical layer level without any media conversion. In other implementations each port communicatively couples any rear media segment attached to the respective rear attachment point to any front media segment attached to the respective front attachment point in other ways for example using a media converter if the rear media segment and the front media segment comprise different types of physical communication media .

In the exemplary embodiment shown in the port is configured for use with front media segments that include a storage device in which the media information for that media segment is stored. The storage device includes a storage device interface that when the corresponding connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to a front attachment point of the port communicatively couples the storage device to a corresponding media interface so that the associated programmable processor can read the information stored in the storage device . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector itself houses the storage device . In another implementation of such an embodiment the storage device is housed within a housing that is separate from the connector . In such an implementation the housing is configured so that it can be snapped onto the media segment or the connector with the storage device interface positioned relative to the connector so that the storage device interface will properly mate with the media interface when the connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to the front attachment point . Although in the exemplary embodiment shown in only the front media segments include storage devices it is to be understood that in other embodiments connector assemblies and or other devices are configured to read storage devices that are attached to or otherwise included with rear media segments and or any auxiliary media segments for example media segments coupled to the network interface .

In some implementations at least some of the information stored in the storage device can be updated in the field for example by having an associated programmable processor cause additional information to be written to the storage device or changing or deleting information that was previously stored in the storage device . For example in some implementations some of the information stored in the storage device cannot be changed in the field for example identifier information or manufacturing information while some of the other information stored in the storage device can be changed in the field for example testing media quality or performance information . In other implementations none of the information stored in the storage device can be updated in the field.

Also the storage device may also include a processor or micro controller in addition to storage for the media information. In which case the micro controller included in the storage device can be used to execute software or firmware that for example controls one or more LEDs attached to the storage device . In another example the micro controller executes software or firmware that performs an integrity test on the front media segment for example by performing a capacitance or impedance test on the sheathing or insulator that surrounds the front physical communication media segment which may include a metallic foil or metallic filler for such purposes . In the event that a problem with the integrity of the front media segment is detected the micro controller can communicate that fact to the programmable processor associated with the port using the storage device interface . The micro controller can also be used for other functions.

The port connector storage device and media interface are configured so that the information stored in the storage device can be read without affecting the communication signals that pass through the media segments and .

Examples of such fiber patch cords and connectors are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 252 386 filed on Oct. 16 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY IN FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS AND METHODS THEREOF also referred to here as the 386 application U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 303 961 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled FIBER PLUGS AND ADAPTERS FOR MANAGED CONNECTIVITY the 961 application and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 303 948 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled BLADED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM the 948 application . The 386 application the 961 application and the 948 application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In some implementations of the patch cords and each plug or connector itself houses the respective storage device and storage device interface. In implementations each storage device and corresponding storage device interface are housed within a housing that is separate from the corresponding plug or connector. In such implementations the housing is configured so that it can be snapped onto or otherwise attached to the cable or the plug or connector with the storage device interface positioned relative to the plug or connector so that the storage device interface will properly mate with the relevant media reading interface when the plug or connector is inserted into the front connector of the corresponding port.

As described above in some embodiments the information that is stored in the storage device can be updated when the associated connector to which that storage device is attached is inserted into a port of a connector assembly . However it is possible for that connector to be removed from the port while a write operation is being performed to update the information stored in the storage device . This can cause the data that was stored in the storage device to become corrupted. describe one approach to addressing this issue.

For ease of explanation certain processing relating to one or more connector assemblies is described below in connection with as being performed by the programmable processor and the software executing on programmable processor . However it is to be understood that all or part of the processing described below as being performed by processor and the software could also be performed by other processors and software associated with each connector assembly . For example all or some of such processing can but need not be performed by a master processor and the software executing thereon where a master slave configuration is used. Also a particular connector assembly can also include more than one processor for example where required by the port density of the connector assembly .

Moreover functionality described here as being implemented in software executing on a programmable processor can be implemented in other ways. For example such functionality can be implemented in hardware using discrete hardware application specific integrated circuits ASICS programmable devices such as field programmable gate arrays FPGAs or complex programmable logic devices CPLDs and or combinations of one or more of the foregoing and or combinations of one or more of the foregoing along with software executing on one or more programmable processors. For example the detection of the insertion of a connector into a port of a connector assembly and or the reading of information from any storage device attached to the connector can be implemented in hardware for example using one or more programmable devices and or an ASIC in addition to or instead of being implemented as software.

The read write section of the storage device is configured to store two copies of the read write information. As shown in first and second copies and respectively of the read write information is stored in the read write section of the storage device . In the particular exemplary embodiment shown in the first copy of the read write information comprises a data part also referred to here simply as data that includes the read write information itself and a checksum that is generated from the data in the first copy of the read write information. Also the second copy of the read write information comprises a data part also referred to here simply as data that includes the read write information itself and a checksum that is generated from the data in the second copy of the read write information.

In this exemplary embodiment the software is configured to only allow write operations to update overwrite or erase one of the first copy and the second copy at a time. In addition the software is further configured so that both the first copy and the second copy cannot be updated overwritten or erased by a single write operation. These features ensure that if an error occurs during a write operation to one of the first copy and the second copy the other copy remains intact. In some example implementations of such an embodiment the processor reads and writes from and to the storage device using a serial protocol which by its nature ensures that the write operations occur sequentially and not in parallel. In some implementations the storage device itself and or the media interface is configured to preclude simultaneous writes to the first copy and the second copy .

The techniques described here in connection with can be used for updating any information that is stored in storage device . For example as noted above the information stored in the storage device can include information indicative of the number of times that a particular connector has been inserted into port also referred to there as an insertion count . As noted above in such an example the insertion count stored in storage device is updated each time the connector to which the storage device is attached is inserted into a port . This insertion count value can be used for example for warranty purposes for example to determine if the connector has been inserted more than the number of times specified in the warranty or for security purposes for example to detect unauthorized insertions of the physical communication media . As shown in the insertion count can be stored in the read write section of the storage device . A first copy of the insertion count is included in the data stored in the first copy of the read write information stored in the storage device . Also a second copy of the insertion count is included in the data stored in the second copy of the read write information stored in the storage device . The exemplary embodiments shown in are described here in connection with updating an insertion count although the techniques described here in connection with can be used for updating any information that is stored in the storage device .

Method comprises detecting an insertion of the connector into the port block . Insertion of the connector can be detected using various approaches such as by detecting connection of the media interface with the storage device interface through completion of a circuit between the power leads and the ground leads of the media interface and the storage device interface using a pull up resistor. Examples of such approaches are described in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 353 906 titled SWITCH STATE INFORMATION AGGREGATION filed on Jun. 11 2010 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the software executing on the programmable processor associated with the port is informed of the insertion of the connector into the port .

After the insertion of the connector is detected an insertion count for the connector is determined from at least some of the information stored in the storage device attached to the connector block . In one implementation of this embodiment the software executing on the processor associated with the port into which the connector was inserted reads at least one of the copies and of the insertion count that is stored in the read write section of the storage device . The processor and the software executing thereon uses the media interface associated with the port into which the connector is inserted to interact with the storage interface of the storage device in order to read at least one copies and of the insertion count from the storage device . The software determines if the one or more of the copies and of the insertion count read from the storage device are valid. If one of the copies and of the insertion count read from the storage device is valid the software uses the insertion count included in that valid copy or as the current insertion count for the connector . The valid copy or of the insertion count read from the storage device that is used as the current insertion count for the connector is also referred to here as the primary copy of the insertion count stored on the storage device and the copy or of the read write information in which the primary copy of the insertion count is included is also referred to here as the primary copy of the read write information stored on the storage device . Likewise the other copy or of the insertion count which is not used as the current insertion count is also referred to here as the secondary copy of the insertion count stored on the storage device and the copy or of the read write information in which the secondary copy of the insertion count is included is also referred to here as the secondary copy of the read write information stored on the storage device . An example embodiment of a method of determining the current insertion count for a connector referenced in block is described below with reference to .

After determining the current insertion count for the connector the current insertion count is incremented block . In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the software executing on the processor associated with the port into which the connector was inserted increments the insertion count value by one. In other embodiments the insertion count may be incremented by another value or decremented from a number of insertion counts remaining.

After the insertion count is incremented the updated insertion count is stored in the storage device using a plurality of sequential storage operations block . In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the software executing on the processor associated with the port into which the connector was inserted uses the media interface associated with that port to interact with the storage device interface for the storage device in order to first overwrite the secondary copy or of the insertion count stored in the storage device with the updated insertion count and then overwrite the primary copy or of the insertion count stored in storage device with the updated insertion count. An example embodiment of a method for performing the sequential storage operations referenced in block is described below with reference to . In other embodiments the updated insertion count is redundantly stored in other ways.

Method comprises reading the first copy of the insertion count from the read write section of the storage device block . Method also comprises reading the second copy of the insertion count from the read write section of the storage device block . While the read operations referenced at block and block are shown in as individual and sequential operations those read operations can also be implemented together in a single read transaction and or can also be implemented as two parallel read transactions. Moreover the reading of the second copy of the insertion count can be delayed until after it is determined that the first copy of the insertion count is not valid as described below in connection with block .

In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the software executing on the processor associated with the port into which the connector is inserted reads all the information stored in the storage device including the first and second copies and of the read write information stored in the read write section and the read only information stored in the read only section in one read transaction. As noted above the first and second copies and of the read write information stored in the read write section of the storage device include respective first and second copies and of the insertion count as well as respective checksums and . In other embodiments the first and second copies and of the insertion count can be read from the storage device in other ways. For example the first copy or a portion thereof such as the first copy of the insertion count and or the checksum can be read from the storage device in a read transaction that is separate from the read transaction in which the second copy or a portion thereof such as the second copy of the insertion count and or the checksum is read from the storage device and or one or both of the first and second copies and or portions thereof can be read from the storage device in one or more read transactions that are separate from the one or more read transactions in which the read only information or portions thereof is read from the storage device .

Method also comprises validating the first copy of the insertion count read from the storage device block . In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the checksum associated with the first copy of the insertion count comprises a cyclic redundancy check CRC code that is calculated based on the data portion of the first copy of the read write information. In this example embodiment the data portion of the first copy of the read write information read from the storage device is used to calculate a checksum more specifically a CRC value . In other embodiments a CRC or other checksum could be calculated at other stages such as during or immediately after the read operation referenced at block . This calculated checksum is compared against the first checksum included in the first copy of the read write information read from the storage device in order to determine if these checksums are equal. If the calculated checksum is equal to the first checksum read from the storage device the first copy of the read write information including the first copy of the insertion count and the first checksum is considered valid. If the first copy of the insertion count read from the storage device is valid block then the value for the insertion count stored in the first copy is used as the current insertion count of the connector block .

If the first copy of the insertion count read from the storage device is not valid then the second copy read from the storage device is validated block . In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with the data portion of the second copy of the read write information read from the storage device is used to calculate a checksum more specifically a CRC value . In other embodiments a CRC or other checksum could be calculated at other stages such as during or immediately after the read operation referenced at block . This calculated checksum is compared against the second checksum included in the second copy of the read write information read from the storage device in order to determine if these checksums are equal. If the calculated checksum is equal to the second checksum read from the storage device the second copy of the read write information including the second copy of the insertion count and the second checksum is considered valid. If the second copy of the insertion count from the storage device is valid block then the value for the insertion count stored in the second copy is used as the current insertion count of the connector block .

If the second copy of the insertion count read from the storage device is not valid then the method enters an error condition block . In some embodiments the error condition indicates that the insertion count for the currently inserted connector has been lost or corrupted. In some embodiments a user is notified of the error and instructed to perform appropriate tasks in response such as replacing the connector. In other example embodiments method is repeated at least one additional time to ensure the error condition is correct. In other embodiments other actions can be taken by the system or user to resolve the error condition.

As noted above the valid copy or of the insertion count read from the storage device that is used as the current insertion count for the connector is also referred to here as the primary copy of the insertion count stored on the storage device and the copy or of the read write information in which the primary copy of the insertion count is included is also referred to here as the primary copy of the read write information stored on the storage device . Likewise the other copy or of the insertion count which is not used as the current insertion count is also referred to here as the secondary copy of the insertion count stored on the storage device and the copy or of the read write information in which the secondary copy of the insertion count is included is also referred to here as the secondary copy of the read write information stored on the storage device .

In the embodiment described here in connection with method is performed after the connector has been inserted into a port of a connector assembly and an insertion count has been determined for the connector as described above in connection with . Method comprises calculating an updated checksum associated with the incremented insertion count block . As described above in connection with block the current insertion count for the connector is determined from the data part or of a valid copy or of the read write information stored in the storage device . This data part or is referred to here as the valid data part or . In the exemplary embodiment described here in connection with an updated checksum is calculated by first updating the valid data part or by replacing the copy or of the insertion count read from the storage device with the incremented insertion count and then calculating the checksum for the updated data part or for example by calculating a CRC code for the updated data part .

Then the secondary copy or of the read write information stored in the storage device is updated to include the incremented insertion count and the updated checksum block . In one implementation of this embodiment the secondary copy or of the read write information that is stored in the storage device is completely overwritten with the updated data part which includes the incremented insertion count as well as any other read write information and the updated checksum calculated from that updated data part. In another implementation of this embodiment the secondary copy or of the insertion count stored in the storage device is overwritten with the incremented insertion count but the other read write information if any is not changed and the associated checksum or is overwritten with the updated checksum calculated for the updated data part.

As noted above in connection with in the absence of any errors the content of the primary copy or of the read write information stored in the read write section of the storage device should be the same as the content of the secondary copy or of the read write information stored in the read write section of the storage device . Thus after the secondary copy or of the read write information is updated to include the incremented insertion count and the updated checksum the primary copy or of the read write information is updated to include the incremented insertion count and the updated checksum block . In some implementations of the embodiment described here in connection with the primary copy or of the read write information is updated to include the incremented insertion count and the updated checksum in the same way the secondary copy or is updated though in other implementations and embodiments the primary copy or of the read write information is updated to include the incremented insertion count and the updated checksum in a way that differs from how the secondary copy or is updated .

As noted above with reference to the read write section is configured to allow only one of the first copy and the second copy to be updated overwritten or erased at a time and by using a single write operation at a time. Thus the distinct write operations described at blocks and do not overlap in time. Because the storage operations do not overlap in time and by updating the secondary copy or of the read write information first in the event that the updating of the secondary copy or fails or corrupts the value of the incremented insertion count stored in the secondary copy or for example because the connector is pulled out of a port while such operation is still being performed the primary insertion count and the primary copy or in which it is included should still be valid. Similarly in the event that the updating of the primary copy or fails or corrupts the value of the incremented insertion count stored in the primary copy or for example because the connector is pulled out of a port while such operation is still being performed the secondary insertion count and the secondary copy or in which it is included should be valid. In this way there should always be a valid copy of the incremented insertion count even if either of the storage operations described at blocks and fails or corrupts the value of the incremented insertion count stored in either the first copy or the second copy . As long as one of the first copy and the second copy is valid and not corrupted the insertion count will be recoverable upon the next insertion of the connector into the port though the insertion count may be off by one .

While the storage operations referenced at block and block are described as individual operations in the particular embodiment shown in method of in other example embodiments the first copy and the second copy are stored during a single transmission or session in which multiple storage transactions occur one or more storage transactions for updating the first copy and one or more other storage transactions for updating the second copy . Still the actual storage of the first copy and the second copy occur sequentially and do not overlap in time.

While the embodiments described above only describe two copies of the incremented insertion count being read and stored using two sets of read operations and two sets of storage operations more than two redundant sets of storage operations may be used in other embodiments. While the embodiments described above describe the insertion of the connector into the port it is understood that the insertion count can be updated on the storage device of the connector by other compatible ports and that the port can update the insertion count on other compatible connectors.
