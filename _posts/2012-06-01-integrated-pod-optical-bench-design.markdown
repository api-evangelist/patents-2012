This Application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 228 032 filed Aug. 8 2008 and claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 010 257 filed Jan. 7 2008 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with United States Government assistance under Contract No. HSSCHQ 04 C 00342 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to pod optical benches and more particularly to an integrated pod optical bench for use in mounting a laser and a directed IR countermeasure head in a counter MANPADS application.

MANPADS are shoulder fired infrared IR guided missiles for use against low flying aircraft. Many experts in the counterterrorism field believe that MANPADS may pose a danger to commercial airliners. Consequently extensive efforts have between made to develop countermeasures to these weapons which are known as counter MANPADS.

Such efforts have included adapting existing infrared countermeasure IRCM technologies for use in counter MANPADS. For example both gimbals and High Powered Multiband Lasers HPMBLs are known in the art. Both prior gimbals and HPMBLs have known optical paths. A need therefore exists for a way to integrate a gimbal and an HPMPL optical path in a limited space such as in a pod to be mounted on an aircraft.

More particularly it is desirable to be able to mount counter MANPAD apparatus on a commercial airliner without having to intrude into the interior space of the aircraft. In order to do this it has been suggested that a pod be mounted to the belly of the aircraft carrying the infrared countermeasure equipment. However a pod carrying the entire system would be canoe shaped and at least as long as a canoe. This is not desirable both because of its massive size and because of the air flow problems that it causes but more importantly because in order to maintain the equipment the entire pod must be removed from the aircraft which is a time consuming project.

It has been proposed that many of the elements of the infrared countermeasure system be distributed throughout the aircraft. However the two elements that are critical for the countermeasure system are the high powered laser and the directed infrared countermeasure DIRCM head and these elements must be co located.

It is exceedingly important to manage the optical path between the laser and the DIRCM so as to maintain strict optical alignment for avoiding microradian errors in the directivity of the laser beam from the DIRCM head towards the target.

It is therefore important to mount the laser and the directed IR countermeasure head so that the optical path is maintained. In order to do this an optical bench is utilized to mount the laser adjacent to the head.

The problem in a lateral mounting which is desirable to minimize intrusion into the belly of the aircraft as would be the case when a laser is mounted on top of the head is that side by side mounting requires an optical bench. As has been discovered the optical bench warps during thermal loading due to the rigid mounting schemes used.

In an effort to minimize warping heavy optical benches have been proposed but the weight alone is enough to make this approach undesirable.

Also even with the largest or most robust of the optical benches warping still occurs which disturbs the original alignment between the laser and the head. Since the head and the laser are separate and are connected using an optical bench which has an integral optical path therein warping of the bench causes laser aiming problems.

Thus there is a requirement for the mounting of the optical bench to the airframe that thermal effects be minimized so that warping is not a problem.

Another problem is the replacement of the laser or the head while still maintaining the original alignment. One would like to be able to achieve interchangeability of the units without having to go through a realignment process. It is thus desirable to be able to install alignment features into the setup so that one could drop a new unit onto the optical bench and maintain the original alignment.

Typically one does not want to have to replace the entire laser directed IR countermeasure head assembly especially if the optical bench is bolted to the frame of the aircraft. Moreover it is very important that the mounting of the two components to the optical bench be repeatable.

As will be appreciated when trying to mount a laser and a head side by side the optical bench may be 48 long by 12 wide. The length of the optical bench is determined by the desire to have a low profile so that when the optical bench is mounted in a pod and the components are mounted side by side the pod is unobtrusive when bolted to the belly of the aircraft.

As mentioned hereinbefore one of the key aspects of the optical bench is that one needs to have some means of preventing flexing of the optical bench and the resulting misdirection of the laser beam. It was found that a rigid mounting of the optical bench to the airframe engendered warpage of the optical bench during thermal cycling.

According to the present invention a strong back optical bench is used to construct the optical path between the gimbaled directed infrared countermeasure DIRCM and the head high power multi band laser. This bench is designed to be very stiff to meet a very precise optical alignment requirement 

How optical bench warpage and flexure is avoided is now described. Rather than rigidly mounting the optical bench to the frame of the aircraft a kinematic style mounting is utilized in which one has a stiff but flexible mount at one end of the bench with two rigid mounts at the other end of the bench. This three point mounting system prevents the bench from warping and bowing during thermal cycling due to the flexing of the third point. Thus in one embodiment the kinematics mount is a three point mount in which one has two rigid bolts at one end of the optical bench and a third mount that is intentionally designed with more flexibility than if one had a rigid bolted connection. Note that the stiff but flexible mount is designed to be weaker than the bench itself so that during thermal cycling the mount flexes rather than the bench thus keeping the bench flat by not inducing flex to the bench.

In one embodiment the bench is mounted by the above mentioned three point mount to the frame of the aircraft and is made of 6061 aluminum.

As a result of the three point mounting with one stiff but flexible coupling any thermal expansion of the bench via a vis the airframe due to different coefficients of thermal expansion will not be taken up by the bench but rather by the flexure of the stiff but flexible coupling. The result is that the thermal stress will not induce either standard or bending loads into the platform. This means that standard loading on the fixed bolts is minimized as well as flexural loading of the bench which would impact the aiming accuracy of the laser beam emitted by the IR countermeasure system.

The subject mounting scheme and alignment features allow for repeatability unit to unit so that the design can incorporate two line replaceable units namely the laser and the DIRCM head. These are bolted to the bench and are interconnected through a fixed optical path with the units being interchangeable such that if one or the other fails one is able to remove and replace it. One can do this without realigning the entire system so that all one has to do is make the mechanical and electrical connections to the two units.

Once having mounted the optical bench in the above manner to the air frame the individual components are aligned through alignment pins and alignment features which in one embodiment involve having a pin and a bushing combination. Note that the pins and bushings need to be precisely located to maintain alignment.

In one embodiment the laser beam is emitted from the laser in a direction perpendicular to the flat plane of the optical bench where it enters the optical bench in a channel and is re directed at a right angle towards the head. When the beam reaches a position underneath the head it is re directed up through the bench into the directed infrared countermeasure head. Thus the optical channel is provided with optics at either end to re direct the light at right angles.

The stiff but flexible mount is strong enough to work structurally under all applied loads but flexible enough so that it does not induce optical bench bending. In one embodiment the stiff flexible mount is made of a metal oval which flexes with thermal loading so that the oval bends and distorts as opposed to the optical bench. Thus the stiff flexible mount is the weak link in the system such that while flexing the mount is still strong enough to carry all of the applied loads.

Because of the three point kinematic suspension which is the subject of the present invention the bench avoids warping during thermal loading thereby to eliminate very small microradian deflections such that optical bench flexing of tenths of thousands of inches is avoided. Note that the optical bench design is limited by the distortion of the optical path that is tolerable and is not governed by the structural survival of applied environmental loads.

Thus the purpose of the subject invention is to provide an optical bench that is stiff enough to maintain the optical path and uses a stiff flexible mount which slightly deflects to accommodate differential expansion between the airframe and the optical bench.

As will be appreciated a very very small deflection of the optical bench if allowed would be multiplied by the optics involved meaning that very small deflections are to be scrupulously avoided. It will thus be appreciated that if the optical bench is at all deflected the beam bending results in a laser aiming error which is multiplicative due to the optics.

The result of the ability to side by side mount the laser and head means minimal penetration into the airframe and results in an overall outside height which does not significantly add to drag. The apparatus mounted on the optical bench is shrouded in an external pod that is conformal to the aircraft structure thus to provide the subject integrated pod optical bench design.

The goal to provide the minimum penetration to the platform and minimum structural modification is achieved through the side by side mounting system made possible through the rigid optical bench and its kinematic mount. The subject system therefore provides a low impact way to install an infrared countermeasure system to commercial and other aircraft so that they can be protected.

In one embodiment the laser and the head are aligned to the optical bench using bushings and pins to accurately locate the devices on the optical bench. Note that for precision alignment the location of the pins and the bushings are to tenths of thousands of an inch thus to assure repeatability.

In summary an integrated pod optical bench design is used to mount a laser and a directed infrared countermeasure head to an aircraft in which the optical bench is kinomatically mounted having two rigid points of connection to the aircraft s airframe and a stiff but flexible mount to isolate the optical bench from thermal stresses due to differing thermal co efficient of expansion between the air frame and the optical bench.

Referring now to an integrated pod optical bench design is shown in which an optical bench carries a high energy laser positioned over an optical channel orifice which introduces light from the laser through an internal channel to an infrared countermeasure head with the light going from the laser through orifice where it is re directed laterally as illustrated at and is then re directed up into head .

Referring to in diagrammatic form laser is affixed to horizontal surface of optical bench such that the beam from the laser enters orifice where it is re directed by mirror down the length of channel where it is again re directed orthogonally by mirror into the base of head .

It is this optical bench with its two components that is bolted to air frame which constitutes a portion of the underside of the aircraft. A pod shown in dotted outline shrouds the equipment to provide a conformal path at the underside of the aircraft.

As mentioned hereinbefore it is a prime concern that the optical bench not bend bow or otherwise become distorted during thermal cycling in which there is a difference in thermal co efficient of expansion between the optical bench and the air frame.

In order to provide the subject kinematic mount for the optical bench so as to eliminate the possibility of any flexure or bending and referring to optical bench is secured to the air frame using two rigid bolts and at one end of the optical bench and flexure at the opposite end of the optical bench. The flexure is actually a stiff but flexible pivot which is secured at one portion to the air frame and another portion to the optical bench.

Referring to flexure is an apertured rectilinear structure embedded into optical bench and in one embodiment has an elliptical cross section as illustrated.

Referring to it can be seen that flexure has an elliptical aperture or hole in a rectilinear ring like structure with the structure being affixed to the optical bench by a bolt whereas the diametric opposite side of flexure is affixed to the air frame platform with a bolt . Flexure is provided in a cavity in optical bench in a loose fit such that any relative motion between the air frame platform and the optical bench is accommodated by distortion or flexing of flexure as illustrated by dotted outline . Thus it can be seen that any relative movement between the air frame and the optical bench is accommodated by flexure such that there is no flexing bowing or movement of the optical bench during thermal cycling.

For repeatable mounting of the various components and referring to a flange is provided on head which is located on the optical bench through the utilization of locator pins so as to locate the optical input precisely at the aperture at one end of optical path . Here bolts are used to secure the flange of the bench with its optical centerline centered upon the optical input due to the positioning of the pins in bushings within the optical bench.

Referring to a bushing is precisely located in the optical bench with the DIRCM head pin press fit into bushing to locate the head with respect to the optical bench and therefore maintain original optical alignment.

With respect to the laser laser as illustrated in is positioned on the optical bench by two locator pins here shown at and on the top side of the laser housing so as to position the laser output directly at aperture .

Once aligned with the pins the laser itself is held to the optical bench through bolt to secure the laser to the optical bench with the alignment being assured by the locator pins. As before the locator pins go into precision bushings on the optical bench with the locator pins being precisely positioned with respect to the optical output of the laser and aperture not shown in this figure to repeatably locate the high energy laser with respect to the optical bench.

In summary what is provided is an integrated optical bench for mounting a laser and infrared countermeasure head on an optical bench with the alignment between the two units being preserved due to the rigidity of the optical bench and the mounting of the optical bench to the aircraft air frame using a kinematic mount in one embodiment including a three point mount in which two of the three points use rigid bolts and in which the third point spaced from these two points is a stiff but flexible mount involving a flexure that has a stiffness less still than the stiffness of the optical bench.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications or additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.
