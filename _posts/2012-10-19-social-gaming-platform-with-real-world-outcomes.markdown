This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 550 263 filed on Oct. 21 2011 entitled Social Gaming Platform with Real World Outcomes which is incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to online multiplayer gaming systems and more particularly to social gaming systems.

Social gaming systems are online gaming systems that operate in the context of online social networks. Social gaming systems make use of social networking infrastructure and social networking relationship information e.g. the social graph to promote the discovery distribution and game play of a social game by users of the social network. Most social games provide relatively simple fictional storylines to establish the game theme and introduce casual game play mechanics e.g. the operations that the player must perform to obtain a goal in the game . Some social games rely on in game advertising and on the purchase of virtual goods with the game to generate revenue for the game provider.

Social gaming is typically only rewarding to players in that it provides entertainment and a means for social interaction with other users and having fun. Notably though existing social games do not directly produce socially beneficial real world outcomes from the user s game play and participation in the game. While some social gaming systems donate revenues earned from the game towards such social causes such outcomes are not related to the operation and structure of the social game or its supporting platform.

A social gaming system allows players to play social games and accumulate a philanthropic virtual currency PVC provided by a social gaming platform that interfaces with the social games. The social games are able to programmatically access the functions of the social gaming platform so as to determine the PVC value associated with activities in these games and indicate an amount PVC to reward to players. The social gaming platform receives requests from players to fund real world projects affiliated with the social gaming platform. The social gaming platform converts the PVC to a real world currency e.g. United States Dollars based on received revenues and provides the real world currency as funding to the affiliated real world projects according to the player s requests. The real world projects use the real world currency to undertake the completion of the socially beneficial projects in the physical real world.

The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims hereof.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The social gaming system allows players to play social games and accumulate a philanthropic virtual currency PVC provided by a social gaming platform that interfaces with the social games . The social gaming platform receives requests from players to fund real world projects affiliated with the social gaming platform . The social gaming platform converts the PVC to a real world currency e.g. United States Dollars based on received revenues and provides the real world currency as funding to the affiliated real world projects according to the player s requests. The real world projects use the real world currency to undertake the completion of the socially beneficial projects in the physical real world.

Players play social games over a network such as the Internet. The social games can be accessed through or embedded in social network systems such as Facebook MySpace Google or the like or may be provided on a standalone service or website. Players access the social games from client devices such as computers mobile phones smart phones internet enabled televisions or other access points to the network.

The social games are video games played by players . Each social game receives player input and provides game related feedback to players based on their input. The social games are operated using networked computer systems using one or more computers to store and transmit the data representing the gaming content and player information and to execute computer programs providing the mechanics of the game operation. Developers of social games are responsible for content and management of the game itself for example the generation of game content player interaction player account management and the like. The content for each social game may be different and does not have to be related in terms of content to the real world projects .

Social games may also incorporate content from social network systems for example lists of friends who are also players of the game may be displayed in game game play may be undertaken by multiple players in a simultaneous cooperative manner players may buy virtual goods for themselves or others using a social network system based currency player actions may be reported as status or player profile information to the social network system.

While the social games are typically developed by third parties unaffiliated with the social gaming platform they can incorporate functionality exposed by a social gaming platform by means of an application programming interface API . All of the functional interactions and exchanges of information between the social games and the social gaming platform are mediated by the API. Examples of functionality which may be provided by the social gaming platform include a philanthropic virtual currency PVC system for contributing to real world projects affiliated with the social gaming platform cross game player tracking revenue management tools for distributing PVC and deriving revenue from its use media management for providing media related to real world projects to social game developers and players and real world project information lookup tools.

The social gaming platform provides a computer implemented programmatically controlled mechanism by which social games can reward players with a philanthropic virtual currency which players earn through game play. Players earn PVC by performing various game related tasks for example achieving in game levels spending an amount of time playing interacting with in game advertisements purchasing virtual goods and executing specific game mechanics defined by the game developers. The amount of PVC earned is generally at the discretion of the social game developer depending upon the amount of PVC they have available. Thus each game may allow players to earn PVC in a different way. In some cases PVC may be purchased by players with real world currency. The amount of PVC a player has accumulated can be used as a measure of influence a player will be able to have on what real world projects they want to help fund.

Earned PVC may be spent by players to contribute to real world projects that are affiliated with the social gaming platform . The social games can request and receive from the social gaming platform a list of real world projects . The social games then provide this list to the player who can allocate the PVC they have earned. The social games provide this allocation information back to the social gaming platform which then combines this information from the multiple different social games to determine the specific real world funding to be given to each real world project.

The PVC is tied indirectly to a real world currency value. The aggregated requests of players to spend PVC are processed by the social gaming platform to determine for each real world project what proportion of total spent PVC within a particular time period has been allocated for each real world project. Described differently by spending PVC a player is providing their vote weighted by the amount of PVC spent regarding what proportion of total revenue should be given to each real world project . To determine the amount of real world currency revenue to donate to each real world project the social gaming platform takes the proportion of PVC spent on each real world project and multiplies it against the total amount of real world currency revenue available for distribution to real world projects for the particular time period.

Real world currency revenue is obtained by the social gaming platform through the sale of PVC to social games sales of virtual goods sponsorships between social games and the social gaming platform sponsorships with outside organizations advertising social game subscription fees or developer specific monetization of the social game . Real world currency may also be obtained through pre established revenue sharing agreements between owners of social games and the owner of the social gaming platform . In one embodiment the revenue sharing agreement between and may define the costs for philanthropic virtual goods PVGs and PVC served by .

The particular time period over which revenue is aggregated and distributed to real world projects may vary. The particular time period may be daily weekly monthly or a variable period depending upon when a threshold revenue target is met. In one embodiment the amount of revenue to be distributed to real world projects is based on a gross revenue received by the social gaming platform minus operating expenses. Operating expenses may include for example transaction fees and server hosting costs for example.

In one embodiment each project gets a periodic pro rata share Fof the total periodic revenue the pro rata share equal to the project s pro rata share of the total PVC given that period. More specifically the amount of revenue Fallocated to each real world project is determined according to the function

The calculation is repeated regularly daily until a project Qreceives the predetermined amount of funds specified to complete execution of the project .

Other relationships are possible. For example only one social game may be affiliated with a social gaming platform which in turn is affiliated with multiple different real world projects . In another example several social games all from a single developer are associated with a social gaming platform which in turn is affiliated with multiple different real world projects where each social game is directly associated with its own real world projects . In this example players are constrained in that they may only spent PVC on real world projects directly associated with each social game .

In another example multiple social games from multiple developers are associated with a social gaming platform which in turn is affiliated with multiple different real world projects where each social game as immediately above is directly associated with its own real world projects . In another example individual developers which may implement one or more social games each may have their own real world projects which the players of their social games may choose between to spend PVC on. In this example players may not spend PVC on the real world projects associated with other developers.

To be able to provide PVC to players social games purchase PVC from the social gaming platform . This prevents social games from inflating the value of PVC by over distributing it to players relative to other social games . The cost of PVC may be defined by volume or based on real world projects affiliated with a developer or with a social game .

The social gaming platform comprises a secure application programming interface API to allow the social games to access the functionality of the social gaming platform. The API is a computer server application that exposes a number of software functions that may be called by social games . All transactions between a social game or developer and the social gaming platform are made through the API by calling functions made accessible by the API. All function calls are established between developers and or social games that are pre approved and registered with the social gaming platform . To protect the API from abuse and corruption all calls are timestamped and cryptographically signed. Each developer has a unique secret key that is used to sign all requests. Examples of functions from the API are as follows.

A function called get pvc developer game count allows a social game to purchase an amount of PVC from the social gaming platform to be distributed to players within the social games they have created or are responsible for. This function includes a financial transaction where the cost for the PVC is debited from a developer s account. Typically developers are invoiced monthly where all purchases of PVC are described and detailed.

A function called check pvc developer game allows a developer to obtain their PVC balance for a particular social game . If only the developer parameter is passed in then the total PVC balance for the developer is returned.

A function called allocate pvc project amount spends an amount of PVC on a particular real world project . The function is called by a social game when a player requests that earned PVC be spent as indicated. The social gaming platform deducts the amount of PVC spent from the developer s PVC balance for the social game or alternatively from the developers total PVC balance for all social games . The social gaming platform then increments the current PVC count jfor the project Q.

A function called player pvc player amount increments or decrements the amount of PVC in a player s account based on their expenditures and earnings. When the player earns PVC from a social game for example through game play the social game calls the function to increment the player s PVC balance. When the player spends PVC the function is called to decrement based on the amount of the expenditure. By separately tracking PVC a player s earned PVC may be utilized across different social games provided by multiple different developers.

A function list projects developer game returns a list of real world projects that players of developer s games or a social game in particular may spend PVC on. The details returned may include for example project name project category the NGO responsible for the project the NGO s logo the NGO s website URL a total budgeted cost media from the progress towards or completion of the project project descriptive text project status e.g. in funding funded in execution completed current funding level and percentage completion of the project. The list of projects is displayed to the player within the game so that player can choose which project s to fund with the PVC they ve earned.

A function project details project returns information regarding real world project . The information may include for example project metadata and project related media. The information is transmitted in the form of a data structure including a chronologically sorted list of events. Example events include a time stamp an event description event details event pictures and event video. The detailed information is provided to the player from within the social game for example on a detail page for the project.

The social gaming platform may further provide support for player tracking independent of any tracking performed by developers or their respective social games or tracking performed by social network systems associated with the social games or the social gaming platform . The tracked information may comprise of player game play information PVC spending histories and social media content posted regarding the games or the real world projects for example. The tracked information may be provided to developers in the form of either statistics regarding individual player behavior or in the form of analytics regarding aggregate use of social games and PVC by players . In one embodiment player information is obtained by adding inputs to the player pvc function described above. Additional inputs may include the name or identification of the player requesting that joy be spent and the timestamp of the request.

The social gaming platform also provides developers with an interactive dashboard e.g. a user interface so that they may monitor and alter their relationships with the social gaming platform and real world projects . The dashboard allows them to monitor and update their PVC balance and bank account information and obtain analytics regarding individual and aggregate player activity. The dashboard may also be used by developers to analyze the performance of their social games to assist them with improving their games and increasing their uptake and use. The dashboard may provide information on for example daily active users DAU monthly active users MAU average revenue per user ARPU average revenue per paying user ARPPU average revenue per game most valuable virtual goods player churn general demographics peak playing times. is a screenshot of a developer dashboard illustrating graphical depictions of collected data according to one embodiment.

The dashboard also allows developers to control the sale of virtual goods that may be offered by the social gaming platform possibly in conjunction with real world projects . Virtual goods may be sold inside social games themselves or externally by developers or the entity managing the social gaming platform . The dashboard also allows developers to control the placement of advertisements inside social games by the social gaming platform . is a screenshot of a developer dashboard illustrating available philanthropic virtual goods according to one embodiment.

The dashboard further allows developers to obtain information regarding real world projects . The information includes descriptive media for a real world projects so that a developer can decide whether or not to include a given real world project as a potential recipient for player s spent PVC. The dashboard allows developers to add or remove real world projects as recipients of PVC from players . The ability of players to spend PVC on a real world project may be controlled at the individual social game level by a developer. is a screenshot of a developer dashboard illustrating real world project information according to one embodiment.

The dashboard also allows developers to view and obtain media related to the real world projects for inclusion in social games or for distribution directly to players . Social games are further configured to make function calls of the social gaming platform s API to request and receive media regarding real world projects . By receiving media regarding the real world projects and presenting it to players the social games can reinforce to players the real world consequences of player s PVC contributions. The media allows players to closely follow the real world progress towards completion of real world projects that they have spent PVC on.

Media regarding the real world projects may be from any stage of the real world project for example prior to initiation during the process of completion or after completion. Examples of types of media include photo diaries video footage blogs interviews audio recordings letters and press releases from affiliates involved completion of the real world project .

Developers of social games may decide how to make media content available to players . For example generally at least some media will be freely available to players and non players alike in order to entice them to play the game. Developers may also choose to restrict some media to players who have contributed varying amounts of PVC to encourage contributions. In other cases media may be provided as projects are completed as completions of real world project milestones may occur after contributions by players have been made.

The social gaming platform is also configured to provide a dashboard for affiliates managing real world projects to receive funding and provide feedback in the form of media on the progress and completion of real world projects . The affiliates managing the real world projects receive funds from the social gaming platform based on revenue and spent PVC. Affiliates may use the allotted revenue to complete the real world projects directly or alternatively they may direct the execution of the real world projects to third parties. The affiliates provide a number of benefits that assist in the completion of the real world projects for example human resources such as project administration and workers capital resources such as tools and infrastructure and know how such as technical expertise government relationships access to specialists and bureaucratic capabilities.

The affiliates responsible for the real world projects use the dashboard to manage their real world projects with respect to the social gaming platform . The dashboard provides a mechanism for affiliates to add new real world projects to the social gaming platform. To add a new project the affiliate inputs the media describing the project so that developers may decide whether to allow players to spend PVC on the project . Each real world project also has a funding goal that has been established by the affiliate. The funding goal is an amount of revenue to be allotted by the social gaming platform based on PVC expenditures to ensure sufficient funding to undertake and complete the real world project in the real world.

The social gaming platform is connected to real world projects that are sponsored by affiliates. The affiliates are responsible for overseeing the real world project itself. The affiliates are responsible for the people working on to implement the real world projects from the contractors project managers and vendors involved in the project to the citizens of the areas affected by the problems that are sought to be solved. The affiliates also gather media regarding the progress and completion of the real world projects to improve the connectivity to the players so that they are vested in the outcome of the projects they help create. The media can be reported in a variety of formats including for example press releases RSS feeds audio or video clips or pictures.

In the social game of the social game has a user interface element displaying to the player the amount of PVC they have earned which they may spend on real world projects . The social game also includes user interface elements displaying information regarding other players of the social game who are connected with the player . illustrates a social game prior to receiving an input from the player to spend PVC on a real world project .

In addition to allowing players to spend PVC on a real world project as part of game play social games may also allow players to purchase philanthropic virtual goods PVGs as gifts for other players . The purchases of PVGs are one for one transactions in which the purchase of each PVG corresponds to the purchase of a real life good in the real world which will be donated to the real world project in response to the purchase of the PVG. In some cases the PVGs may affect game play for the recipient player .

An example of a PVG is the purchase of a Virtual Vitamin Shop in a social game . In response to purchasing the PVG a package of vitamins is donated to a real world project that provides services to children in need. Records of PVG purchases are maintained in a inventory controlled by a database that is part of the social gaming platform . Responsive to receiving a player purchase request through the social gaming platform s API the social gaming platform communicates with the affiliate responsible for the real world project associated with the purchased gift to donate the real world good. Every PVG has a real world currency value and players may purchase them in game using PVC or more traditional such as social media credits e.g. Facebook Credits Paypal Apple Store transactions or credit card.

As with the expenditure of PVC purchasing PVGs may also grant the purchasing player or the receiving player the ability to receive media associated with the PVG. For example if the PVG is part of a real world project to donate 50 000 pairs of shoes to needy children upon purchasing the PVG the purchasing or recipient player may receive video and photographs of the shoes being delivered.
