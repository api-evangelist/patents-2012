A search engine is an information retrieval system used to locate documents and other information stored on a computer system. Search engines are useful at reducing an amount of time required to find information. One well known type of search engine is a Web search engine which searches for documents such as web pages on the World Wide Web. Examples of such search engines include Yahoo Search at http www.yahoo.com Bing at http www.bing.com and Google at http www.google.com . Online services such as LexisNexis and Westlaw also enable users to search for documents provided by their respective services including articles and court opinions. Further types of search engines include personal search engines mobile search engines and enterprise search engines that search on intranets among others.

To perform a search a user of a search engine supplies a query to the search engine. The query contains one or more words terms such as hazardous waste or country music. The terms of the query are typically selected by the user to as an attempt find particular information of interest to the user. The search engine returns a list of documents relevant to the query. In a Web based search the search engine typically returns a list of uniform resource locator URL addresses for the relevant documents which is displayed to the user in a search results page. If the scope of the search resulting from a query is large the returned list of documents may include thousands or even millions of documents.

Many publishers that operate websites accessible on the Internet have an understanding of content desired by users but do not have access to such content. For example a publisher who is a connoisseur of vintage automobiles may desire to serve an audience that is interested in vintage automobiles. As such the publisher may desire to obtain online content associated with vintage automobiles and to provide such content in an up to date and automatic fashion. The publisher may know of other websites that contain such content and that are currently accessible by users. However conventionally it is a time consuming manual process for the publisher to retrieve and process that content into a form that the publisher desires for it to be shown on the publisher s website.

Techniques for generating and publishing searchable feeds for selected websites are provided. A publisher is enabled to have a search index generated for a selected website. The search index functions as a searchable feed for receiving and responding to queries regarding the content of the selected website. For instance the publisher may provide a search interface e.g. on a website of the publisher that enables queries to be provided to the index. Responses to the queries may be displayed to users on the publisher s website. Furthermore the search index may be shared with other publishers such that the other publishers can provide a search interface for the search index on their websites to process queries. Still further combined indexes may be generated from multiple indexes. Search interfaces may be provided to enable queries to be submitted to the combined indexes and responses to the queries to the combined indexes may be displayed to users on publisher websites.

In one method implementation an indication is received of content of interest of a selected website. In one implementation the indication may be provided by marking sample pages of the selected website. A plurality of pages is retrieved from the selected website e.g. by crawling the website . The retrieved pages are processed according to the indicated content of interest to generate structured content. The structured content is indexed to generate an index. A query interface is provided that receives queries directed to the index applies the received queries to the index and transmits responses to the received queries.

In one system implementation a searchable feed generating system includes a content retrieval engine an indexing engine and a query interface. The content retrieval engine receives an indication of content of interest of a selected website retrieves a plurality of pages from the selected website and processes the retrieved pages according to the indicated content of interest to generate structured content. The indexing engine indexes the structured content to generate an index. The query interface receives queries directed to the index applies the received queries to the index and transmits responses to the received queries.

Computer program products are also described herein. The computer program products include a computer readable medium having computer program instructions recorded thereon that enable searchable feeds to be generated for websites that enable the searchable feeds to be queried and that enable further embodiments as described herein.

These and other objects advantages and features will become readily apparent in view of the following detailed description of the invention. Note that the Summary and Abstract sections may set forth one or more but not all exemplary embodiments of the present invention as contemplated by the inventor s .

The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally the left most digit s of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.

The present specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of the invention. The disclosed embodiment s merely exemplify the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment s . The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.

References in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an example embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

Numerous exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described as follows. It is noted that any section subsection headings provided herein are not intended to be limiting. Embodiments are described throughout this document and any type of embodiment may be included under any section subsection.

Many publishers that operate websites accessible on the Internet have an understanding of content desired by users but do not have access to such content. Furthermore content available on the World Wide Web today has the problem that it is largely unstructured. For example a website for a restaurant may include information for the restaurant such as an address the hours of operation and a menu. This information can be read and understood by humans but is basically generic text to a machine. As such such information provided by websites is difficult to structure in an automatic fashion.

Embodiments enable publishers to editorially mark sites for content of interest to them and cause that content to be indexed and made searchable. Publishers can then use the searchable content to display enhanced content to their users. Furthermore the publishers can share the marked content in a searchable form with other publishers to help improve each other s sites. Such a searchable feed ecosystem encourages sharing and hence causes search experiences on publisher sites and on sites that manage the feed ecosystem to be better.

Thus embodiments enable the creation and indexing of structured content. This marking of websites to indicate context of interest may be performed by anyone including publishers of the websites developers or anyone else that is interested in such information. As such a wide variety of persons are enabled to create structured content from content that is already available on the World Wide Web. Accordingly embodiments provide an ecosystem that enables the creation of and the consumption of such structured content by all types of users.

For instance a Publisher A that is a connoisseur of vegetarian food may desire to provide reviews of restaurants recipes and a meet up group for the audience. However Publisher A may not have any reviews of restaurants. However Publisher A may know of an online website called VegansOnline that provides reviews of restaurants and that many of his potential customers may access to view the reviews. Embodiments enable publishers such as Publisher A to simplify the process of building a search website by generating a search index for a selected website. In the current example Publisher A may be enabled to provide a search interface on his her website that enables visitors to his her website to search the restaurant reviews of VegansOnline. Furthermore embodiments enable the search index to be shared with other publishers such that the other publishers can provide a search interface for the search index on their websites to receive queries from users.

Such embodiments have benefits. For instance an owner of a website that is indexed may have increased traffic to their website and enhanced visibility in search results pages. The publisher of the search interface for an index may obtain content for display on their website at relatively low cost is provided with an indexing and crawling infrastructure has access to a searchable ecosystem of feeds has monetization opportunities for the displayed content e.g. sponsored search and access to search provider search branding. The provider of the indexing and crawling infrastructure e.g. a central service such as a conventionally available search engine provider etc. receives branding on publisher sites may obtain revenue through sponsored search and or usage fee revenue from publishers sites receives access to web content and receive highly structured highly relevant content associated with searches e.g. to use to learn about publishers users etc. .

Embodiments may be implemented in various embodiments. For instance illustrates an example environment in which publishers may generate searchable feeds based on selected websites. shows a block diagram of an online system in which such searchable feeds may be generated and accessed according to an example embodiment.

As shown in of searchable feed generating system includes a content retrieval engine an indexing engine and a query interface . Further structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s based on the following discussion regarding flowchart and searchable feed generating system .

Flowchart begins with step . In step an indication is received of content of interest of a selected website. For example as shown in an indication is received by content retrieval engine . Indication may be received from a publisher e.g. at a publisher server and indicates content of interest to the publisher that is located at a website e.g. hosted by a content server such as a structure of how information is displayed by the website. In an embodiment indication may indicate a website of interest e.g. by uniform resource locator URL or other website link or identifier and may indicate content included in one or more pages of the website of interest. For instance in one example indication may be provided by Publisher A described above connoisseur of vegetarian food indicating a website that provides reviews on vegetarian restaurants e.g. www.veganonline.com and may indicate restaurant review information at the website to be of interest. For instance indication may indicate a format or structure of how the website displays restaurant reviews e.g. indicating one or more fields such as a restaurant title description price range textual review rating indication etc. . Indication may be provided in various forms examples of which are described in further detail further below.

In step a plurality of pages is received from the selected website. In an embodiment content retrieval engine may retrieve a plurality of web pages from the website indicated in indication in various ways such as by crawling the website. As shown in content retrieval engine retrieves content e.g. one or more web pages etc. from the selected website. Content retrieval engine may be a proprietary web crawler or a commercially available web crawler as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s or may be configured to retrieve content in other ways. Examples of content retrieval engine configured to perform content retrieval are described in further detail further below.

In step the retrieved pages are processed according to the indicated content of interest to generate structured content. In an embodiment content retrieval engine may process content according to the indicated content of interest to generate structured content . For instance structured content may include structure e.g. fields etc. from the pages of content that was indicated in indication as being of interest. The fields and or other structure may be indicated in structured content using tags and or other structure identifiers. Examples of content retrieval engine configured to generate structured content are described in further detail further below.

In step the structured content of interest is indexed to generate an index. For instance as shown in indexing engine receives structured content . In an embodiment indexing engine indexes structured content to generate index . Index may be a non inverted e.g. forward or inverted index. Index may be generated by indexing engine according to proprietary or commercially available techniques as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s . For instance in an embodiment provided for purposes of illustration indexing engine may generate index to include a list of tokens e.g. words and a plurality of document weight value pairs. Each token is a potential query term and is a key to index . Each document weight value pair includes a portion of the content of structured content as the document e.g. a URL and includes a weight value corresponding to the document. In index each token may have a corresponding list of one or more of the document weight value pairs. As such a query having one or more query terms may be applied to index resulting in a list of ranked content being generated based on the document weight value pairs that is ordered based on a ranking function. In other embodiments index may be structured in other ways as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s . Examples of indexing engine are described in further detail further below.

In step a query interface is provided that receives queries directed to the index applies the received queries to the index and transmits responses to the received queries. For example in an embodiment query interface may receive queries that are directed to index and or optionally to further indexes . As shown in query interface receives searchable feed query from a requester which includes one or more query terms e.g. words . Query interface may apply the query terms of searchable feed query to index to generate query results. For instance as described above a list of ranked content may be generated by applying the query terms to index . The query terms may be used as keys to index such that document weight value pairs corresponding to tokens matching the query terms are selected. These document weight value pairs maybe processed to generate the ranked list of content. Query interface transmits the query results to the requester in searchable feed query response . Query interface may be implemented in various ways including as an application programming interface API a web service etc. Examples of query interface are described in further detail further below.

Searchable feed generating systems may be configured in various ways to perform their functions. Example embodiments for searchable feed generating systems and further embodiments are described in the following subsections.

A searchable feed generating system may be configured in various ways to perform step of . For instance shows a block diagram of searchable feed generating system configured to provide a user interface for indicating content of interest for a searchable feed according to an example embodiment. As shown in searchable feed generating system includes content retrieval engine and a user interface module . User interface module is configured to generate a user interface that a user can interact with to configure a searchable feed by indicating a website and content of interest.

For example as shown user interface module may generate a user interface that is displayed by a display of a user device . User device is an example of one of user devices in . In an embodiment user interface module may generate user interface as a web page or other web object that is displayed in a browser of user device . User interface may enable a user e.g. a publisher editor and or developer to view one or more web pages of a website of interest to the user and to mark the web page s to indicate content of interest of the website that the user desires to make accessible on another website. For instance the user may be enabled to mark sample web pages of a website hosted by a content server. The sample web pages may be selected from the website by the user as generally representative of the structure of the website. The user may be enabled to mark any portions of the content displayed on the sample web pages to indicate a structure e.g. a URL structure of the desired content of the website.

For instance shows a user interface configured to display and mark a sample web page to indicate content of interest for a searchable feed according to an example embodiment. In an embodiment user interface may be generated by user interface module of and displayed at user device in a browser. As shown in a sample web page may be displayed in a marking window of user interface . A user may of user interface may be enabled to navigate to a sample web page to have the sample web page presented in marking window . Furthermore the user may be enabled to interact with the sample web page in marking window to indicate a structure of sample web page and to indicate content of interest of the sample web page. Any number of web pages of the website may be marked in this manner to indicate a structure of the website and to indicate content of interest.

As shown in user interface further includes a preview selected content list a save field button a content fields list and a next button . The user may use a mouse pointer or other user interface element to select a displayed element of a sample web page such as a title header name description contact information phone number cell phone number instant messaging address mailing address email address etc. one or more links and or any further displayed fields or elements to indicate a structure of the page. An identifier for the selected element is displayed in preview selected content list and by selecting save field button e.g. by a mouse pointer click or other action the selected element may be listed in content fields list . The user may be enabled to input a textual name for the selected element which appears in content fields list . The user may select additional fields elements of the web page in this manner to have them listed in contents fields list to identify the structure of the sample web page. When the user has listed all of the elements of interest of the web page in content fields list the user may select next button to save the list to optionally mark a next web page of the website and to indicate that marking the content of interest of the website is complete.

For instance in a sample web page is displayed in marking window . User interface enables sample web page to be marked to indicate content of interest for a searchable feed. As shown in sample web page includes a title element and a plurality of restaurants additional restaurants may be present that are not visible in but that may be viewed by scrolling downward in marking window . Each of restaurants includes a common structure. For instance restaurant is shown including a name field an address field a phone number field a description field a save link an Add to MyFav link a Reviews link an update link and a Link to this link . Restaurants and include a same structure as restaurant . A user of user interface can select any of these fields links of sample web page to have them listed in preview selected content list and can select save field button to have the field link included in content fields list to indicate the structure of sample web page .

For instance as shown in a user has selected name field having a value of Grand Appetit of restaurant as indicated by box shown around selected name field . As a result the value of selected name field appears in preview selected content list . In an embodiment because the user selected name field in restaurant each name field in restaurants and may also appear selected e.g. by a corresponding box etc. because these fields have a common structure e.g. are indicated by a common tag such as restaurant name in the underlying code for sample web page . In other words when name field is selected user interface may search the underlying code for sample web page e.g. HTML code XML code etc. for a tag for name field . After the tag for name field is determined all displayed fields links having a same tag as name field may be indicated as selected. If some displayed fields links are erroneously indicated as selected by user interface the user may be enabled to de select those particular fields links. In this manner a structure of sample web page is determined and recorded.

Note that the embodiments of user interface and sample web page shown in and described above are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. User interface can be configured in various ways with various numbers types and positions of user interface elements e.g. text entry boxes pull down menus pop up menus buttons e.g. single buttons radio buttons etc. check boxes etc. to enable marking of a sample web page. Any type of sample web page similar to or different from sample web page may be marked using user interface . Furthermore user interface module may be implemented in any manner to perform its functions. An example embodiment for user interface module is the Dapper tool provided at open.dapper.net by Yahoo Inc. which enables users to mark web pages for information to be retrieved from websites.

Content retrieval engine of may be configured in various ways to perform steps and of . For instance shows a step providing a process for retrieving content from a selected website according to an example embodiment. In an embodiment content retrieval engine may perform step . Step is described as follows with respect to . shows a block diagram of content retrieval engine and a content server according to an example embodiment. Content server is an example of one of content servers of . As shown in content retrieval engine includes a web crawler and a content formatter . Further structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s based on the discussion regarding step and content retrieval engine of .

In step the selected website is crawled to retrieve the plurality of web pages. In an embodiment referring to web crawler may be configured to crawl the website selected by the user e.g. in step of described above to retrieve one or more web pages of the website. For example as shown in web crawler may crawl a website hosted by content server . Web crawler may download one or more web pages from website such as web pages and additional web pages as content . As shown in web crawler outputs received content as downloaded content .

Web crawler may be configured to perform website crawling in various ways as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s . For instance web crawler may communicate with a variety of content servers such as content servers via network . In some embodiments web crawler may start with a list of one or more URLs of a website to visit. The list may be referred to as the seed list. As web crawler visits each URL in the seed list web crawler may identify the hyperlinks for documents files in the corresponding web page file and add the hyperlinks to a list of URLs to visit which may be referred to as the crawl frontier. URLs from the crawl frontier may be recursively visited according to a set of policies. Web crawler may retrieve files by generating a copy to be stored in storage such as local cache storage associated with searchable feed generating system cache storage may refer to a persistent storage device . Web crawler may likewise follow links such as HTTP hypertext transfer protocol hyperlinks in the retrieved files to additional files and may retrieve those files by generating copies for storage and so forth. Web crawler may therefore retrieve files from one or more content servers as it crawls a website. Web crawler may perform a crawl job for a particular publisher at the time the selected website is provided may add the crawl job to a queue of crawl jobs for crawl scheduling or may perform the crawl job at any other time and or in any other manner.

Referring back to in step the retrieved pages are processed according to the indicated content of interest to generate structured content. As shown in in an embodiment content formatter receives downloaded content and structures downloaded content according to the structure indicated in indication . As shown in structured content is output by content formatter . Structured content may include particular fields elements from each page in downloaded content that are indicated with structure such as tags e.g. anchor tags that anchor a URL to some text in a web page div tags that define a section in an HTML document and or further types of HTML tags etc. to identify the fields elements. Structured content may be generated as one of more files feeds or other data structures that include the content of interest in any form such as in a human readable textual form in the form of an RSS or other type of feed in the form of a programming code or language such as XML extensible markup language HTML etc. and or in other form.

For instance in the above example of restaurant reviews web crawler may crawl the website VeganOnline to retrieve one or more web pages of the website. Content formatter may receive the web pages from web crawler as downloaded content . Content formatter may parse the web pages for the content of interest indicated in indication . For example content formatter may extract sections of content from the web pages that occur repeatedly as indicated by a div tag or other indication. In the restaurant example each restaurant that is mentioned in the web pages may be indicated by a restaurant div tag. Fields for each restaurant such as restaurant name e.g. name field restaurant address e.g. address field etc. may be indicated. Each indicated section e.g. restaurant and its corresponding fields may be extract from the web pages in the form of key value pairs e.g. field name and field value and included in structured content which may be a file a feed or other object . The sections and fields may each be indicated in structured content by corresponding tags e.g. div tags anchor tags etc. . In this manner structured content includes the content of interest of downloaded content and indicates the structure of the content of interest e.g. in the form of tags that indicated structure such as div tags etc. . The remaining portions of downloaded content that are not extracted by content formatter may be discarded.

Note that the embodiments of content retrieval engine shown in and described above are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. Content retrieval engine can be configured in other ways as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein.

Indexing engine may be configured in various ways to perform step of . For instance shows a block diagram of indexing engine according to an example embodiment. As shown in indexing engine includes an index generator a weight calculator and an index inverter . Index generator receives structured content . Structured content may be received from content retrieval engine in the form of one or more documents containing program code e.g. HTML XML etc. . Index generator may parse structured content to remove unnecessary characters and to determine information to be indexed. For instance index generator may identify tokens in structured content and URLs e.g. documents to be indexed.

As such in an embodiment index generator may generate index to include a list of documents and for each document may list the tokens included in the document. Index having such an organization may be referred to as forward index. In an embodiment index inverter may optionally be present and may invert the forward index to generate index as a reverse index. In such an embodiment index may include a list of tokens and for each token may list each of the documents in which the token is included. Still further in an embodiment weight calculator may generate a weight value for each document listed for a token and or may generate a weight value for each portion of a document e.g. for each tagged field of the document to generate a plurality of document weight value pairs and or document field weight value pairs for each token. The weight value for an item indicates a relevance of the item to the token. Such weight values may be generated by weight calculator in any way as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s e.g. by frequency of the token in the section by position of the token in the section etc. .

For instance in the above example of restaurant reviews index generator may generate index to include a plurality of documents where each document represents a corresponding restaurant e.g. as determined by the div tags and or by other mechanism . Furthermore each listed restaurant may have a list of key value pairs representing the fields of the restaurant e.g. title description etc. and their values. Each key value pair may be assigned a corresponding weight value. For instance each title value pair may be weighted higher relatively to each description value pair etc. Thus in one example embodiment index may be generated to include a list of tokens and for each token there may be a list of one or more documents representing restaurants with each restaurant having a plurality of key value pairs. When a query is applied to index the documents listed for the tokens of the query may be processed to determine a weight for each document e.g. determining a weight for each restaurant based on some combination of the weights assigned to the key value pairs of the document. The documents e.g. restaurants with the highest determined weights may be have the highest rankings for the query and may be provided in response to the query in a ranked order.

Note that in an embodiment a user e.g. the publisher developer editor etc. that indicated the content of interest of the website in step of may provide an indication of a type or category of the content of interest. For instance in the example of restaurant reviews the content of interest obtained from the VeganOnline website may be categorized as location information because restaurants and their locations are identified. Such a data category may be used by index generator to optimize generation of index in a manner as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s .

In a further embodiment indexing engine may be configured to combine indexes together. For instance multiple indexes may be generated that correspond to multiple different websites that contain similar content. The multiple indexes may be combined together into a combined index and received queries may be applied to the combined index to generate query results based on the contents of the multiple websites.

For instance shows a block diagram of indexing engine configured to combine multiple indexes according to an example embodiment. As shown in indexing engine includes an index combiner . Index combiner receives first and second indexes and . First index may have been generated by indexing engine based on content retrieved from a first website and second index may have been generated by indexing engine based on content retrieved from an additional second website. Index combiner combines first and second indexes and to generate a combined index . Combined index may be an inverted or non inverted index and may have a similar format as index described above or a different format. Index combiner may combine indexes and in any manner such as by a merge. For instance to generate a combined forward index from a pair of forward indexes entries of second index that are not present in first index may be identified and added to first index . This combined forward index may be inverted to generate a combined inverted index. Alternatively to generate a combined inverted index directly from a pair of inverted indexes entries of second index that are not already present in first index may be added first index for the appropriate tokens.

Note that the embodiments of indexing engine shown in and described above are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. Indexing engine can be configured in other ways as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein.

Query interface may be configured in various ways to perform step of . For instance shows a block diagram of query interface coupled to storage according to an example embodiment. As shown in query interface includes a query receiver an index querier and a response formatter . Query receiver is configured to receive queries directed to indexes supported by query interface such as indexes stored in storage . Any number of indexes may be stored in storage that are supported by query interface including tens hundreds thousands and even greater numbers of indexes. Storage may include one or more of any type of storage mechanism including a magnetic disc e.g. in a hard disk drive an optical disc e.g. in an optical disk drive a magnetic tape e.g. in a tape drive a memory device such as a RAM device a ROM device etc. and or any other suitable type of storage medium.

Query receiver may be configured to parse a received query such as searchable feed query to determine the one or more indexes that the query is directed to and to determine the one or more query terms included in the query. For instance shows an example query that may be submitted by a user to a publisher site and forwarded to query interface according to an embodiment. Query includes one or more feed identifiers and one or more query terms . Feed identifier s includes the identifiers for the feeds indexes to which query is directed. Query term s includes the query term s of query . Any number of feed identifiers may be included in feed identifiers and any number of query terms may be present in query terms . For instance a query including the following three query terms of 1989 red and corvette may be directed to a Classic Cars feed having an associated index at stored in storage . Query receiver may parse query to determine the one or more feed identifiers and one or more query terms which are output from query receiver as parsed query .

As shown in index querier receives parsed query . Index querier applies the query term s of parsed query to the index es in storage corresponding to the feed identifier s of parsed query to generate a query response. The query response includes a list of ranked documents e.g. URLs . For instance as described above index may include indexes entries that are each assigned a value referred to as a weight. A query term applied to index may correspond to an index entry. The query response may be ranked by scoring files or records located in index such as in accordance with number of times a query term occurs weighed in accordance with a weight assigned to an index entry corresponding to the query term. Other aspects may also affect ranking such as a proximity of query terms within a located record or file or semantic usage for example. A score and an identifier for a located record or file for example may be stored in a respective entry of a ranking list. A list of query results may be ranked in accordance with scores which may be provided in response to the query. In some embodiments machine learned ranking MLR models may be used to rank search results. MLR is a type of supervised or semi supervised machine learning problem with the goal to automatically construct a ranking model from training data. In other embodiments other ranking techniques may be used as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art s . As shown in index querier generates query results .

As shown in response formatter receives query results and formats query results to generate searchable feed query response . For example in an embodiment response formatter may format query results to include fields and or other information indicated in structured content generating searchable feed query response to include these fields and or other information. Searchable feed query response is transmitted to the publisher server or other entity that provided searchable feed query .

Thus in an embodiment query interface may operate according to . shows a flowchart providing a process for processing a received query according to an example embodiment. Further structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s based on the following discussion regarding flowchart .

Flowchart begins with step . In step a query is received from an entity at the query interface that identifies a feed associated with the index and includes at least one query term. For example as described above a user may submit a query e.g. query of at a user device to a search interface of a publisher website e.g. hosted by website at publisher server of . The publisher website may forward the query to be received by query receiver at query interface e.g. as searchable feed query . Alternatively the query may be received by query receiver directly from the user e.g. not through an intermediate publisher server . The query may identify one or more feeds and one or more query terms similarly to query shown in .

In one example a publisher server may have a website e.g. FoodReview at www.foodreview.com that provides a search interface for restaurant reviews provided at the above mentioned content server hosted website VeganOnline . The search interface at the publisher website e.g. FoodReview may enable queries to be provided to a searchable feed e.g. generated from the website VeganOnline at a searchable feed generating system identified as VeganOnlineRestaurants. An example query directed to the feed that may be input by a user may include the following information 

For instance in the example the user may desire to locate vegetarian Asian restaurants in Paris France. As such the user may provide the above query terms. Furthermore the search interface may associate an identification of the feed with the query terms to be transmitted to the query interface of the searchable feed generating system as shown as follows 

By including the feed identifier of VeganOnlineRestaurants query interface can identify the appropriate index in storage to which to apply the query terms. Still further the search interface may optionally be configured by the publisher to include one or more additional query terms with the query if desired e.g. to perform a more tailored search than would be performed based on the user query terms alone .

Referring back to in step the index is queried with the at least one query term to generate a query response. As described above with respect to index querier applies the query term s of parsed query to the appropriate index in storage to retrieve and generate query results e.g. a list of documents . Index querier may order the query results according to a ranking.

Continuing the above example index querier may apply the received query terms of Asian Paris and France to index in this example index corresponds to the identified feed of VeganOnlineRestaurants . Index querier may generate query results that include a list of restaurants that best match the received query terms and which may be ranked in terms of the best match first to the worst match last . For example the following query results may have been generated 

 For ease of illustration two entries are shown in the above example list of query results although greater numbers of query results entries may have been generated. 

Referring back to in step the query response is transmitted to the entity. As described above with respect to response formatter receives and formats query results and transmits the formatted query results as searchable feed query response . Response formatter may format the query results in any manner such as by including associated fields and or other information from structured content with each result entry.

Continuing the above example response formatter may apply information collected in structured content to each of the query results received for the query terms of Asian Paris and France applied to index . For example the following formatted query results may be generated where various fields marked in sample web page may be included with each query result entry 

Description Small and cozy Asian vegetarian restaurant serving Chinese cuisine including some mockmeats. Operated by a meditation group who are strict vegetarians. Reported to have become all vegan since summer 2009. Call for hours. There is a health food store next door.

First Review Pretty OK mostly vegan Chinese. The menu is full of familiar favorites fried noodles spring rolls and lots of tofu and fake meat dishes served either in a marmite small covered clay pot or in a standard dish. If you want dim sum get there early they stop serving it around 1 p.m.

Description Paris vegan restaurant opened in 2009. Part of international chain of vegan restaurants opened by followers of Supreme Master Ching Hai an advocate for vegetarian living. Serving Asian and French food coffee non alcoholic beverages and more. Accepts credit cards. Open Mon Thur 12 noon 3 pm and 6 30 pm 10 pm Fri Sat 12 noon 3 pm and 7 pm 10 30 pm closed Sun.

First Review Not even close to other Loving Huts. Can t agree with the positive reviews on here unfortunately. This has been an awful experience. Apart from the obvious weirdness of this place like the Supreme Master TV spots shown on TV all the time like in any other Loving Hut this is definitely not a place to visit while you re in Paris there are simply so many better places to eat vegan food.

Accordingly searchable feed query response may be generated to include the query results formatted to include structure defined by the publisher and may be transmitted to the publisher server. As described further below the publisher server may forward searchable feed query response as is to the user device that submitted the original query or may add additional content to the query response.

As described above combined indexes may be generated by combining multiple indexes. Indexes shown in may include any number of combined indexes and queries may be directed to such combined indexes in any manner. For instance a combined index may be indicated in a query e.g. in feed identifier s by the publisher server that receives a query from a user or in other manner. Furthermore when query interface receives a query that indicates multiple feed identifiers query interface may apply the query term s of the query separately to each of the corresponding indexes and may generate a separate query response for each of the feed identifiers. Alternatively query interface may generate a single query response that includes query response information for all of the feed identifiers together.

Note that the embodiments of query interface shown in and described above are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. Indexing engine can be configured in other ways as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s from the teachings herein.

As described above a publisher server may host a website that includes a search interface for accessing a searchable feed. For instance as shown in publisher servers each host a corresponding one of websites . Each of websites may include a web page that may be navigated to by a user using a browser at a user device e.g. one of user devices . The web page may include a search interface that a user may interact with to input a query to a searchable feed. For instance shows a block diagram of a web page that provides a search interface according to an example embodiment. A user may interact with search interface to input query terms to be submitted to a searchable feed. Search interface may be provided in any manner including as a form displayed in web page a widget displayed in web page or in any other manner. For example as shown in query entry box may include a query entry box into which the user can enter e.g. type in one or more query terms to be submitted as a query e.g. by clicking on a submit button . In other embodiments search interface may provide one or more alternative user interface elements that enable a user to input a query to a searchable feed.

Upon submitting the query to search interface as described above the query is provided to a searchable feed associated with search interface . For instance the query may be received at a query interface that applies the query to an index associated with the searchable feed. The query interface generates a query response for the searchable feed that is provided to the publisher server to be provided to the user that submitted the query.

Note that any number of user devices may include any number of search interfaces for submitting queries to any number of searchable feeds. Furthermore search interfaces may be configured to display query responses received from the searchable feeds. For example shows a block diagram of query responses being provided from a plurality of searchable feeds for display in a plurality of publisher query results pages according to an example embodiment. In first third searchable feeds are present each having an associated one of indexes . First third searchable feeds may be accessed at a same query interface e.g. query interface or at different query interfaces query interfaces are not shown in for ease of illustration . Furthermore first and second results web pages and are shown that are provided by respective publisher servers to be displayed at respective user devices that submitted queries.

For instance first results web page displays first and second feed widgets and . First feed widget enables queries to be submitted to and received from first searchable feed and second feed widget enables queries to be submitted and received from second searchable feed . Furthermore second results web page displays a second instance of the second feed widget and a third feed widget . As mentioned second feed widget enables queries to be submitted to and received from second searchable feed . Furthermore third feed widget enables queries to be submitted and received from third searchable feed

As shown in first feed widget in first results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to first searchable feed . Second feed widget in first results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to second searchable feed . Second feed widget in second results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to second searchable feed . Third feed widget in second results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to third searchable feed

Furthermore search interface may be used to submit queries to combined searchable feeds that are associated with combined indexes formed from multiple individual indexes . For instance shows a block diagram of query responses being provided from a combined searchable feed to a plurality of publisher query results pages according to an example embodiment. In a combined searchable feed is present that has an associated combined index . Furthermore first and second results web pages and are shown that provided by respective publisher servers to be displayed at respective user devices that submitted queries. For instance first results web page displays a first instance of a combined feed widget and second results web page displays a second instance of the combined feed widget . Combined feed widget enables queries to be submitted to and received from combined searchable feed . For instance as shown in combined feed widget in first results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to combined searchable feed . Combined feed widget in second results web page shows a query response as a response to a query provided to combined searchable feed .

Note that query responses may be transmitted in various forms to entities for display. For instance as shown in query responses may be transmitted to entities for display in a widget. In further embodiments query responses may be transmitted to entities in a RSS real simple syndication feed in a web page e.g. in the form of HTML as an XML file or file containing other programming code in a widget etc.

In embodiments the publisher server that receives a query response may format the query response to be displayed on a results web page in any manner. Furthermore in an embodiment the publisher server may combine the query response with further content to be displayed on the results web page. For instance shows a block diagram of a publisher server configured to package a query response feed with additional content according to an example embodiment. Publisher server is an example of one of publisher servers shown in . As shown in publisher server includes a query response packager . Query response packager receives searchable feed query response and is configured to package content with searchable feed query response to generate query response . As described above query response may be transmitted to a user device to be displayed to the user e.g. in a web page etc. 

Query response packager may be configured to package various types of content with a query response. For instance in one embodiment query response packager may contain a map generator. When searchable feed query response includes location information e.g. restaurant locations query response packager may generate map data that is included in query response . In this manner a map may be displayed on the results web page that indicates the location information e.g. shows locations of restaurants on a map . The map may be displayed alongside the other contents of query response . Examples of map generators include mapping tools such as Yahoo Maps MapQuest and Google Maps. In further embodiments query response packager may be configured to package additional and or alternative types of content with a query response for display in a results web page such as one or more advertisements e.g. selected based on a user profile and or the contents of query response from which the publisher can obtain revenue social network information e.g. displayed in a social network widget reference information e.g. accessed from a reference portal such as Wikipedia at http www.wikipedia.com The Encyclopxdia Britannica at http www.britannica.com etc. and or other types of content.
