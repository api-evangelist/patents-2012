This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 831 459 which was filed on Jul. 7 2010 and which is entirely incorporated by reference herein.

The technology disclosed herein relates to presentation of new content via a communication device. Exemplary implementations of the technology are presented in the context of a mobile communications device and its enterprise network.

Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the technology. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the technology only not as a limitation of the technology. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present technology. For instance features described as part of one implementation of the technology can be used on another implementation to yield a still further implementation. Thus it is intended that the present technology cover such modifications and variations that come within the scope of the technology.

In order to facilitate an understanding of environments in which example implementations described herein can operate reference is made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which implementations of the technology can be applied. The communication system may comprise a number of mobile communication devices that may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system .

These figures are exemplary only and those persons skilled in the art will appreciate that additional elements and modifications may be necessary to make the communication device e.g. operable in particular network environments. While in the illustrated implementations the communication devices e.g. may comprise smart phones in other implementations the communication devices may comprise personal digital assistants PDA tablet computers laptop computers desktop computers servers or other communication devices capable of sending and receiving electronic messages.

Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless network that may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some implementations the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some implementations the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some implementations the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSPDA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway that connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the Internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network e.g. an intranet and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some implementations the network may be realized using the Internet rather than or in addition to an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network that in some implementations conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other implementations such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface that may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly as indicated by the dashed line in via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be used . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP and HTTP Secure HTTPS communications to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices that might connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange Server IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email server a content server for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization s internal servers application servers for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications to mobile communication devices and intranet file services.

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some implementations communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some implementations communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some implementations the private encryption key is stored only in the user s mailbox on the messaging server and on the mobile communication device and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices is encrypted by the wireless connector system using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox. The encrypted data when received on the mobile communication devices is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly data sent to the wireless connector system from the mobile communication devices is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data when received on the wireless connector system is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server or content servers or application server . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or content servers or application servers to the wireless network gateway that then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination. A mobile communication device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device and a computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A Personal Area Network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are used to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the BLUETOOTH special interest group or IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or other PAN connection.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

As will be appreciated from an exemplary mobile communication device as an example of comprises a display located above a keyboard constituting a user input means that is suitable for accommodating textual input to the device . In some implementations the keyboard can be part of a touch screen display. The front face of the device has a navigation row . As shown the device is of uni body construction also known as a candy bar design.

The device may include an auxiliary input that acts as a cursor navigation tool and that may be also exteriorly located upon the front face of the device . The front face location of a cursor navigation tool allows the tool to be thumb actuable e.g. like the keys of the keyboard . Some implementations of the technology provide the navigation tool in the form of a trackball that may be utilized to instruct two dimensional screen cursor movement in substantially any direction as well as act as an actuator when the trackball is depressed like a button. Other implementations can provide the navigation tool in the form of a trackpad a touchpad a pointing stick joystick graphics tablet or combinations thereof. The placement of the navigation tool can be above the keyboard and below the display screen here it may avoid interference during keyboarding and does not block the operator s view of the display screen during use.

The device may be configured to send and receive messages. The device includes a body that can in some implementations be configured to be held in one hand by an operator of the device during text entry. A display is included that is located on a front face of the body and upon which information is displayed to the operator e.g. during text entry. The device may also be configured to send and receive voice communications such as mobile telephone calls. The device also can include a camera not shown to allow the device to take electronic photographs that can be referred to as photos or pictures. Further the device can be configured to operate a web browser.

Referring to a block diagram of a communication device such as and in accordance with an exemplary implementation is illustrated. As shown the device includes a microprocessor that controls the operation of the communication device . A communication subsystem performs communication transmission and reception with the wireless network . The microprocessor further can be communicatively coupled with an auxiliary input output I O subsystem that can be communicatively coupled to the communication device . In at least one implementation the microprocessor can be communicatively coupled to a serial port for example a Universal Serial Bus port that can allow for communication with other devices or systems via the serial port . A display e.g. can be communicatively coupled to microprocessor to allow for display of information to an operator of the communication device . When the communication device is equipped with a keyboard e.g. the keyboard can also be communicatively coupled with the microprocessor . The communication device can include a speaker a microphone random access memory RAM and flash memory all of which may be communicatively coupled to the microprocessor . Other similar components may be provided on the communication device as well and optionally communicatively coupled to the microprocessor . Other communication subsystems and other communication device subsystems are generally indicated as being functionally connected with the microprocessor as well. An example of a communication subsystem is a short range communication system such as BLUETOOTH communication module or a WI FI communication module a communication module in compliance with IEEE 802.11b and associated circuits and components. Additionally the microprocessor is able to perform operating system functions and enables execution of programs on the communication device . In some implementations not all of the above components are included in the communication device . For example in at least one implementation the keyboard is not provided as a separate component and is instead integrated with a touch screen as described below.

The auxiliary I O subsystem can take the form of a variety of different navigation tools multi directional or single directional such as a trackball navigation tool as illustrated in the exemplary implementation shown in or a thumbwheel a navigation pad a joystick touch sensitive interface or other I O interface. These navigation tools may be located on the front surface of the communication device or may be located on any exterior surface of the communication device . Other auxiliary I O subsystems may include external display devices and externally connected keyboards not shown . While the above examples have been provided in relation to the auxiliary I O subsystem other subsystems capable of providing input or receiving output from the communication device are considered within the scope of this disclosure. Additionally other keys may be placed along the side of the communication device to function as escape keys volume control keys scrolling keys power switches or user programmable keys and may likewise be programmed accordingly.

The keyboard can include a plurality of keys that can be of a physical nature such as actuable buttons or they can be of a software nature typically constituted by representations of physical keys on a display referred to herein as virtual keys . It is also contemplated that the user input can be provided as a combination of the two types of keys. Each key of the plurality of keys is associated with at least one action which can be the input of a character a command or a function. In this context characters are contemplated to exemplarily include alphabetic letters language symbols numbers punctuation insignias icons pictures and even a blank space.

In the case of virtual keys the indicia for the respective keys are shown on the display which in one implementation is enabled by touching the display for example with a stylus finger finger tip finger nail or other pointer to generate the character or activate the indicated command or function. Some examples of displays capable of detecting a touch include resistive capacitive projected capacitive infrared and surface acoustic wave SAW touch screens.

Physical and virtual keys can be combined in many different ways as appreciated by those skilled in the art. In one implementation physical and virtual keys are combined such that the plurality of enabled keys for a particular program or feature of the communication device is shown on the display in the same configuration as the physical keys. Using this configuration the operator can select the appropriate physical key corresponding to what is shown on the display . Thus the desired character command or function is obtained by depressing the physical key corresponding to the character command or function displayed at a corresponding position on the display rather than touching the display .

Furthermore the communication device is equipped with components to enable operation of various programs as shown in . In an exemplary implementation the flash memory is enabled to provide a storage location for the operating system device programs and data. The operating system is generally configured to manage other programs that are also stored in memory and executable on the processor . The operating system honors requests for services made by programs through predefined program interfaces. More specifically the operating system typically determines the order in which multiple programs are executed on the processor and the execution time allotted for each program manages the sharing of memory among multiple programs handles input and output to and from other device subsystems and so on. In addition operators can typically interact directly with the operating system through a user interface usually including the keyboard and display . While in an exemplary implementation the operating system is stored in flash memory the operating system in other implementations is stored in read only memory ROM or similar storage element not shown . As those skilled in the art will appreciate the operating system device program or parts thereof may be loaded in RAM or other volatile memory.

In some implementations the flash memory may contain programs for execution on the device including but not limited to an address book a personal information manager PIM and a device state . Furthermore programs such as social software and other information including data can be segregated upon storage in the flash memory of the device .

When the communication device is enabled for two way communication within the wireless communication network it can send and receive signals from a mobile communication service. Examples of communication systems enabled for two way communication include but are not limited to the General Packet Radio Service GPRS network the Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service UMTS network the Enhanced Data for Global Evolution EDGE network the Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network High Speed Packet Access HSPA networks Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service Time Division Duplexing UMTS TDD Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB networks Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX and other networks that can be used for data and voice or just data or voice. For the systems listed above the communication device may use a unique identifier to enable the communication device to transmit and receive signals from the communication network . Other systems may not use such identifying information. GPRS UMTS and EDGE use a Subscriber Identity Module SIM in order to allow communication with the communication network . Likewise most CDMA systems use a Removable User Identity Module RUIM in order to communicate with the CDMA network. The RUIM and SIM card can be used in multiple different communication devices . The communication device can be configured to operate some features without a SIM RUIM card but it will not necessarily be able to communicate with the network . A SIM RUIM interface located within the communication device allows for removal or insertion of a SIM RUIM card not shown . The SIM RUIM card features memory and holds key configurations and other information such as identification and subscriber related information. With a properly enabled communication device two way communication between the communication device and communication network is possible.

If the communication device is enabled as described above or the communication network does not use such enablement the two way communication enabled communication device is able to both transmit and receive information from the communication network . The transfer of communication can be from the communication device or to the communication device . In order to communicate with the communication network the device can be equipped with an integral or internal antenna for transmitting signals to the communication network . Likewise the device can be equipped with another antenna for receiving communication from the communication network . These antennae in another exemplary implementation are combined into a single antenna not shown . As one skilled in the art would appreciate the antenna or antennae in another implementation can be externally mounted on the communication device .

When equipped for two way communication the communication device features a communication subsystem . As is understood in the art this communication subsystem is modified so that it can support the operational needs of the communication device . The subsystem includes a transmitter and receiver including the associated antenna or antennae as described above local oscillators LOs and a processing module that in the presently described exemplary implementation is a digital signal processor DSP .

It is contemplated that communication by the communication device with the wireless network can be any type of communication that both the wireless network and communication device are enabled to transmit receive and process. In general these can be classified as voice or data or both voice and data. Voice communication generally refers to communication in which signals for audible sounds are transmitted by the communication device through the communication network . Data generally refers to all other types of communication that the communication device is capable of performing within the constraints of the wireless network .

Example device programs that can depend on such data include email contacts and calendars. For each such program synchronization with home based versions of the program can be desirable for either or both of their long term and short term utility. As an example emails are often time sensitive so substantially real time or near real time synchronization may be desired. Contacts on the other hand can be usually updated less frequently without inconvenience. Therefore the utility of the communication device is enhanced when connectable within a communication system and when connectable on a wireless basis in a network in which voice text messaging and other data transfer are accommodated. Device can include programs such as a web browser a file browser and client programs for interacting with server programs. Devices e.g. for use in the technology can be characterized by an identification number assigned to the device. Such identification numbers cannot be changed and are locked to each device.

Implementations of the technology can be realized as programming across the architectural elements identified in and . In some implementations the programming is entirely on the mobile communications device . In some implementations programming for the technology is on the mobile communications device while data used by the mobile communications device is on the wireless connector system or a network server such as content server messaging server or application server . In some implementations programming for the technology can be realized on a remote server. Allocation of functionality among architectural elements can be a function of several factors including latency processing resource availability and efficient usage storage availability and efficient usage and revenue opportunities.

Social software encompasses a range of software systems that allow users to interact and share data. This computer mediated communication has become very popular with social sites like MySpace Facebook and Bebo media sites like Flickr and YouTube as well as commercial sites like Amazon.com and eBay . Many of these applications share characteristics like open application programming interfaces APIs service oriented design and the ability to upload data and media. The terms Web 2.0 and for large business applications Enterprise 2.0 are also used to describe this style of software. The more specific terms collaborative software and groupware are usually applied to software that enables collaborative work. Distinctions among usage of the terms social trusted and collaborative are in the applications or uses not the tools themselves although some tools are used only rarely for collaborative work.

IBM Lotus Connections is an example of a social software application. Lotus Connections has ten parts Homepage a portal site that can federate information from many sources Profiles a social network service primarily used to find people in the organization Communities a collaborative space for people with common interests to work together Blogs a blogging service Bookmarks a social bookmarking service Activities a task management tool for groups of people to work together on a specific project or task Files a content library for storing sharing and revision management of computer files Wikis a Wiki system for publishing and editing content Tags for describing and organizing information content and people and Microblogs for keeping the extended network apprised of status etc.

Modules are built on a set of services according to the service oriented architecture concept. These modules take the form of applications which are hosted on an application server. This design allows the modules to be hosted independently of each other combined with each other or interact with each other in support of very large scale deployments.

The Homepage serves as a portal for users social collaboration. Out of the box Lotus Connections provides seven components that can be individually installed enabled and or customized by the user. Information Technology IT Administrators can add new components applications or widgets for use by users. The Homepage module also includes a recent updates display which shows changes such as new content posts and status updates which are relevant to the user. A system to update the user s status via microblogging is also provided.

The Profiles module provides an online directory of people within an organization. People can be located in different ways such as by keywords names responsibilities interests projects they are part of their expertise their business relationships tags applied to their profile and their geographical location. A profile typically contains a person s name job role base location reporting chain and details about the Lotus Connection bookmarks activities communities and blogs in which the person participates. Profiles can also be customized and new fields added.

The Activities module is a task management system that enables groups of people to collaborate on a task. Activities may be structured in a nested tree hierarchy where entries to do items and sections branch off from the root activity. Any non section entity in an activity can contain rich text and custom fields for files links text people and dates. To Do items can also have a due date and the name of each person assigned to the To Do task.

The Files module is a file sharing service that can be used to upload and share files tag them and recommend comment on them.

The Communities module enables ad hoc and planned collaboration around a project or area of interest. A Connections Community can have its own blog forums bookmarks activities feeds member list Wiki and Files.

The Blogs service allows a user to present ideas get feedback from others and learn from the expertise and experience of others who blog. A blog can be created for the use of the members of a community. Videos links and images can be embedded in a blog posting.

The Bookmarks social bookmarking service permits users to save organize and share bookmarks and also discover bookmarks that have been qualified by others. Browser bookmarks or subsets of browser bookmarks can be imported into the Bookmarks service. This can prove useful when initially populating a bookmarks list in the Bookmarks service or updating it with a new topic of interest. Bookmarks can also be exported from the Bookmarks service and imported into a browser or shared with someone who does not use the Bookmarks service.

New content e.g. a status update an article from an aggregator service an instant message an e mail a new updated wiki or blog entry a change to a collaboratively created edited document a new forum post can be pushed to a mobile device to be accessed by a user of a social software application. Typical social software applications provide some notification of new content pushed to a device. Referring to a home screen of a mobile device e.g. is shown. The home screen includes a header and a footer . The footer displays an icon for each of several applications including an icon for Lotus Connections. The arrival of new content can be indicated by an asterisk e.g. white on a solid color e.g. red circular background located for example in the upper right quadrant e.g. superscript position of an icon e.g. icon . Given that footer is not always shown on a typical mobile device home screen the arrival of new content can be indicated by an asterisk in mini icon of the device home screen header . In addition a notification of the arrival of new content can be given using one or more other graphical indicators sound vibration haptic feedback transmission or publication of a notification to one or more other applications e.g. a social networking and microblogging application such as Twitter or a user s email account a window that clears upon the device receiving acknowledgement and or a window that clears upon the device receiving other input e.g. a splat . When the application is opened e.g. by the device receiving selection of an icon e.g. the device can display further indication of which feature of the application contains the newly pushed content. Beyond that however the user is left to navigate within the application to find the new content.

Applications and functions within applications typically have a landing page that can provide a consistent or predictable screen that can be displayed in order to help orient a user for further navigation. Content below the landing page can provide different and interconnected paths to additional screens. The landing page can differ for each major function or component usually indicated by a distinct navigation icon . The landing page can be the most recent page displayed by the application. Referring to a navigation diagram of the present technology is shown. Upon a complete restart of the application the application Homepage as distinguished from the device home screen e.g. can be the landing page.

The application can display a new content listing. Referring to an Updates tab of a Lotus Connections Homepage is shown. The illustrated listing identifies new content to various Lotus Connections parts e.g. a status update to a Profile a comment on a File . Where the new content itself is susceptible to being displayed e.g. the status update such new content can be displayed directly or by use of a scrolling marquee. Where the new content is less susceptible to being displayed directly e.g. a newly shared document a link to the new content can be displayed. In each case a link to more information e.g. can be presented by the device.

In some mobile communication device software architectures a user may have to navigate to an application e.g. via icon and within an application further navigate e.g. via icon to page or similar and via link to retrieve new content for which the user has received a notification. An application may have additional content to download once the user chooses to access the content related to the notification e.g. via link . Particularly when a mobile device is out of coverage this action may be impossible. In some cases when the device is out of coverage the user may be required to navigate through several pages of unusable incomplete information to reach the notifications and new content that has been pushed to the device. Some solutions may utilize the main phone screen to display pushed content as it arrives. This approach can get cluttered when multiple applications or feeds are subscribed to.

In some implementations the technology receives new content and presents a notification of received new content via the device. The notification can be in the form of one or more of text graphics audio haptics transmission of a message etc. In particular implementations the notification is an asterisk on a solid color circular background displayed in superscript over at least one of an application icon a mini icon an application part module icon. Upon receiving selection of the notification the technology can directly display a listing of new notifications. When the device is out of coverage the technology can offer navigation paths that relate only to content available on the device.

The technology can improve the reachability of pushed content by controlling which screen the technology displays when a notification of pushed content has been selected. In some implementations the technology directly displays a list of new content which list would otherwise be several page navigation steps away from other landing screens of the application. Navigation is further improved by the technology in the situation when the device is out of coverage by taking the user directly to the page s that contain the locally stored pushed content bypassing screens that rely on over the air data retrieval.

Referring to and TABLE 1 the performance of some implementation of the technology is described. In these implementations audio alert for new content notifications has been enabled on the mobile device.

In the situation of TABLE 1 Ref. 1 4 with the device in coverage an audio alert sounds upon receiving notification of new content. Where the application i.e. Lotus Connections is open and the listing of new content i.e. New Top Updates NTU is the current displayed screen no notification is added to the Homepage icon and the new content listing is added to NTU screen . If the NTU page is the current landing page of the application but the application is the background then the screen is not refreshed and the notification is added to the Homepage icon . Where the application is open and any screen other than the NTU screen e.g. the Top Updates TU screen is displayed a notification is added to the Homepage icon and the Top Updates screen remains the displayed screen. Upon receiving selection of the Homepage icon the NTU screen is displayed by the technology. When the device is in coverage and the application is not open upon receiving a notification of new content the technology can display a new content notification on at least one of the application mini icon and the application main icon . Upon receiving selection of either icon or selection of any other form of actionable notification such as a link an icon embedded in an email or a message in some other social software the technology can display the NTU screen .

In the situations of TABLE 1 Ref. 5 8 with the device out of coverage no additional notifications can be received. However notifications previously received and any pushed content associated therewith can be presented by the technology. For example when the application is not open yet content had been pushed to the device while the device was in coverage but the content list has not been displayed both the application mini icon and the application main icon will display with a notification of new pushed content. Selection of either icon will cause the technology to display the NTU screen in response. If the application is open and the NTU screen is displayed while the device is out of coverage then no indication of new content will be present at the application icon or the application mini icon . If the TU screen or any screen other than the NTU screen is displayed under those circumstances then the application icon the application mini icon and the Homepage icon will indicate new content and selection of each icon will prompt the technology to display the NTU screen .

Referring to methods of the technology are illustrated. The methods can be embodied as computer implemented methods can be embodied in a communication device and can be embodied in a computer program product. Methods begin with receiving notification of new content within an application at a device . The received notification is presented at the device . Presenting the notification can be done within the application outside the application or both within and outside the application. Examples of notification presented outside the application include posting notification on a social network posting notification to a web site posting a message to a user s avatar in a virtual world posting notification in a video conferencing session posting notification in a web conference session posting notification in an instant messaging session posting notification in an email and posting notification in a video game that the user is playing. Presentation can be by various means disclosed herein including audio visual and haptic. Upon receiving selection of a presented notification the new content can be displayed in the screen directly following such selection . In some implementations displaying the new content in the screen directly following receiving the selection of the notification comprises displaying only the new content stored on the device. Displaying only the new pushed content stored on the device can reduce the number of screens including non applicable screens that a user must navigate to access the content that is available.

The technology can take the forms of hardware software or both hardware and software elements. In some implementations the technology is implemented in software which includes but is not limited to firmware resident software microcode a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC etc. In particular for real time or near real time use an FPGA or ASIC implementation is desirable.

Furthermore the present technology can take the form of a computer program product comprising program modules accessible from computer usable or computer readable medium storing program code for use by or in connection with one or more computers processors or instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description a computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain store communicate propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device. The medium can be an electronic magnetic optical electromagnetic infrared or semiconductor system or apparatus or device or a propagation medium though propagation mediums in and of themselves as signal carriers are not included in the definition of physical computer readable medium . Examples of a physical computer readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory removable memory connected via USB magnetic tape a removable computer diskette a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk read only memory CD ROM compact disk read write CD R W DVD and Blu Ray . Both processors and program code for implementing each as aspect of the technology can be centralized or distributed or a combination thereof as known to those skilled in the art.

A data processing system suitable for storing a computer program product of the present technology and for executing the program code of the computer program product will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code bulk storage and cache memories that provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. Input output or I O devices including but not limited to keyboards displays pointing devices etc. can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I O controllers. Network adapters can also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems cable modem WiFi and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters. Such systems can be centralized or distributed e.g. in peer to peer and client server configurations. In some implementations the data processing system is implemented using one or both of FPGAs and ASICs.
