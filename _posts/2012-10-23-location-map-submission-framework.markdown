This patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from Provisional Patent Application No. 61 550 607 which was filed Oct. 24 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The teachings in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention relate generally to building a map of a location using a portable electronic device. More specifically the teachings relate to building a map of a location using a portable device and allowing a user of the device to edit the built map with the device based upon the users perspective with regards to the location and uploading the built map to a server at least for use by another user such as to provide to the user a layout and or map of the location such as an event location and identify a position of one or more users at the location.

This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated herein what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Service providers e.g. wireless and cellular services and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of location based services and technologies for presenting mapping data to users of mobile devices e.g. data that is presented as maps displayed on a user s wireless or cellular device . Accordingly service providers and device manufacturers are continually challenged to develop new mechanisms for enhancing the mapping data and location based services provided to their users.

Certain abbreviations that may be found in the description and or in the Figures are herewith defined as follows 

In an exemplary aspect of the invention there is a method comprising scanning a location with a portable electronic device using a motion performed with the portable electronic device based on the scanning using the motion building a map of the location and displaying the built map on the portable electronic device.

In another exemplary aspect of the invention there is a portable electronic device comprising at least one processor and at least one memory including computer program code where the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured with the at least one processor to cause the device to at least scan a location with the portable electronic device using a motion performed with the portable electronic device based on the scanning using the motion build a map of the location and display the built map on the portable electronic device.

In still another exemplary aspect of the invention there is an apparatus comprising means for scanning a location with a portable electronic device using a motion performed with the portable electronic device means based on the scanning using the motion for building a map of the location and means for displaying the built map on the portable electronic device.

The exemplary embodiments of the invention provide at least a method which allows a user of a portable electronic device which may be referred to as a mobile device to build a map of a particular location. More specifically the embodiments of the invention provide at least a method to a build map of a location using data from a perspective of an individual at the location. This type of mapping when shared can allow others to identify on the map a location of the user that created the map with the portable electronic device.

Conventional location based applications of portable electronic devices do not provide sufficient resolution to identify where a user is located relative to features of a location such as a stage of a concert hall or a point of interest of a location. Moreover although conventional location based service providers may be capable of interpreting and or plotting high resolution maps the conventional location technology applications that are available to the service providers cannot provide such high resolution maps to remote users as required to clearly identify on the maps users and or groups of users at a location. As such the service providers who use these conventional location technology applications can only provide as high a resolution as the conventional applications are capable of. Therefore as similarly stated above the conventional applications and thus the service providers cannot create maps which can be used to identify where the users and or groups of users are located from the perspective of a mapped location.

In order to address at least these shortfalls of the conventional applications as stated above the exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a method for a user of a portable electronic device to produce a resolution adjustable layout and or map of a location using the device. The resolution adjustable layouts and or maps enable a viewer of the map to identify a location from any perspective of the mapped location of the user that created the map. In addition the exemplary embodiments of the invention provide the ability for the user to provide these novel maps to a server for availability by other users. A user provided map can then be used to formulate heuristics such as for media combinations based on a position of a user on a grid layout of a map built by the user with the portable electronic device. Such heuristics or application logic can be used by a service application provider to request for example from user s at the location that the user s capture media from various different angles or positions based on particular grid location s of an uploaded map. Thus the exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a clear benefit to application service providers for at least the reason the invention allows them to offer new and or improved service which can be dynamic and interactive.

In addition the method in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention enables crowdsourcing map building tasks by an undefined group of people at a particular location. Crowd sourced map information services are known in the art. However users of these conventional crowd sourced information services do not provide maps as such but rather they only enter points of interest data significant places data or even correct incorrect data to existing maps. However there are no services where users can themselves create and submit a map. In accordance with the exemplary embodiments users are enabled to create approximations of a layout of areas using a motion function of a client application on device. As an example three different users create a map of the same event location for example and each of the maps shows a location of the respective user at the event. After the three different maps have been uploaded to the server they can be combined into a single map which shows each of the three user locations at the event. In addition in accordance with the embodiments of the invention the other two maps may be downloaded by one of the users and combined by the client application on the user device to depict a map showing the locations of all three users at the event. In addition a first user for example may acquire more than one map from other users and combine the maps of the other users with the client application on the electronic device of the first user without including a map built by the first user. Further in accordance with an embodiment of the invention the maps may be acquired and or shared between the users directly such as with peer to peer communications using a network the Internet and or a cellular network for example and or using short range communication technologies such as Bluetooth and infra red. In this regard the client application can be configured to merge the maps using predefined permissions. Such permissions can include master client application permissions defined for a client application such that for example the master client application can use its own defined map layout of a location over other user layouts. In addition in accordance with the embodiments the users are enabled to also make changes to their created layout and if allowed changes to the layouts created by the other users. Thus it can be seen that the operations in accordance with the invention can create a variety of new services as well as provide benefit to existing services.

As similarly stated above the exemplary embodiments provide a method for creation and submission of individual maps and or segments of maps built by each of one or more users at a particular location. Each individual segmented map built by an individual user at the location with a portable electronic device. Such individual segmented maps submitted by more than one user can be used for crowdsourcing map building. The advantages of this crowdsourcing map building can be especially beneficial to users at a location such as an event location a concert area a sports arena an event area a karaoke pub area to name only a few. Furthermore such novel map building techniques can be used to benefit a variety of applications at least to enable a map to be displayed on an electronic device which identifies one or more users at the location. It is noted that the creation and submission process in accordance with the invention as described in detail below is applicable to both outdoors and indoor maps.

It is understood that presently an individual user may not be able to provide high resolution maps through crowd sourcing technologies. However the embodiments of the invention provide a client based solution where users can each at least provide a generalized segmented formation of a location or place such as where an event may be taking place. Further the exemplary embodiments of the invention can benefit any application which requires knowing user locations and or tracking group movements without the need for individual accuracy.

The service client software server side software depends on sensor combinations within the device to support map submissions and management. This includes orientation and location sensors.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention the server provides a RESTful or other interface for clients submissions. The RESTful interface allows interaction between clients and servers. The RESTful interface may be using HTTP and or other Application Layer protocols. A client initiates a request to a server and then the server processes the request and responds accordingly. The request and the response involve a transfer of a representation of a resource. The resource can essentially be mapping data and a representation of a resource can be an object representation that captures a state of the resource.

Though user client authentication through accounts and user rewards for submissions can be included in at least the method and apparatus in accordance with the invention user client authentication is known in the art and not further described in this description.

The exemplary embodiments of the invention may be practiced to the advantage of a user of a portable electronic device at least allowing the user to generate a segmented map of the location. A segmented map can be a generic map created with minimal information such as using a set of block tiles automatically or manually generated with computer processes of the portable electronic device for the user based on a wave action with the device.

Reference is now made to for illustrating a simplified block diagram of various electronic devices and apparatus that are suitable for use in practicing the exemplary embodiments of this invention. In a wireless network is adapted for communication over a wireless link with a portable apparatus such as UE via a network access node such as a base station in this case the eNB . The network may include a network control element NCE that may include functionality as a mobility management entity MME and serving gateway GW and which provides connectivity with a further network such as a telephone network and or a data communications network e.g. the internet . The UE includes a controller such as a computer or a data processor DP A a computer readable memory medium embodied as a memory MEM B that stores a program of computer instructions PROG C and a suitable radio frequency RF transceiver D for bidirectional wireless communications with the eNB via one or more antennas. The eNB also includes a controller such as a computer or a data processor DP A a computer readable memory medium embodied as a memory MEM B that stores a program of computer instructions PROG C and a suitable RF transceiver D for communication with the UE via one or more antennas. The eNB is coupled via a data control path to the GW .

At least the PROG C is assumed to include program instructions that when executed by the associated DP enable the device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention as discussed above by non limiting examples. That is the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented at least in part by computer software executable by the DP A of the UE or by hardware or by a combination of software and hardware and firmware . In addition the server similarly includes at least one computer readable memory and or database B embodying at least one computer program code C and at least one data processor A configured to execute computer program code to perform operations in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention. In addition the database B can be external to the server .

In general the various embodiments of the UE can include but are not limited to cellular telephones personal digital assistants PDAs having wireless communication capabilities portable computers having wireless communication capabilities image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing as well as portable units or terminals or tablets that incorporate combinations of such functions.

The computer readable MEMs B and B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology such as semiconductor based memory devices flash memory magnetic memory devices and systems optical memory devices and systems fixed memory and removable memory. The DPs A and A may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may include one or more of general purpose computers special purpose computers microprocessors digital signal processors DSPs and processors based on a multicore processor architecture as non limiting examples.

The exemplary UE may have a camera controlled by a shutter actuator and optionally by a zoom actuator which may alternatively function as a volume adjustment for the speaker s when the camera is not in an active mode. There may also be an image video processor and or a separate audio processor . The graphical display interface is refreshed from a frame memory as controlled by a user interface chip which may process signals to and from the display interface and or additionally process user inputs from the keypad and elsewhere.

Within the sectional view of are seen multiple transmit receive antennas that are typically used for cellular communication. The antennas may be multi band for use with other radios in the UE. The power chip controls power amplification on the channels being transmitted and or across the antennas that transmit simultaneously where spatial diversity is used and amplifies the received signals. The power chip outputs the amplified received signal to the radio frequency RF chip which demodulates and down converts the signal for baseband processing. The baseband BB chip detects the signal which is then converted to a bit stream and finally decoded. Similar processing occurs in reverse for signals generated in the UE and transmitted from it.

Throughout the apparatus are various memories such as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM and in some embodiments there can be removable memory such as the illustrated memory card on which the various programs C are stored.

All of these components within the UE are normally powered by a portable power supply such as a galvanic battery .

The processors if embodied as separate entities in a UE or eNB may operate in a slave relationship to the main processor A A which may then be in a master relationship to them. Other embodiments may combine some of the functions described above for in fewer processors and or memories. Any or all of these various processors of access one or more of the various memories which may be on chip with the processor or separate therefrom.

Note that the various chips e.g. etc. that were described above may be combined into a fewer number than described and in a most compact case may all be embodied physically within a single chip.

In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention there is a method for a user to invoke a client application E of a portable electronic device in order to create and to submit a segmented map of a particular indoor or outdoor location such as an event location. The method is performed using a portable electronic device the device including at least one computer program code stored on at least one computer readable memory and the computer program code executed by at least one processor to perform the method. In accordance with the exemplary embodiments the portable electronic device can be the UE such as illustrated in the method performed using suitable components such as the MEM B the PROG C and the DP A of the UE .

The exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described in more detail below at least in part with regards to as described above and in view of . illustrates a user interface UI of a client application running on the portable electronic device in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention. It is noted that as stated above a portable electronic device suitable to perform the method in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention is not limited to user equipment of a cellular network such as the UE . Rather as similarly stated above the embodiments of the invention can be practiced using any type of portable electronic device with wireless communication capabilities.

As a non limiting example it is assumed that the user is located at an indoor location such as where an event can take place. As stated earlier the exemplary embodiments of the invention enable the user of a portable electronic device to generate a segmented map of a location. A method in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention is described in stages as follows 

A client application E on the UE retrieves location coordinates such as with a GPS A GPS function of the UE . In addition the coordinates may be retrieved from other location functions of the device and or functions of the network in which the device is operating such as WLAN location identification service of the network. The client application E sends a type of map check request to a server such as the server . A map check request may query the server such as regarding whether there is already a map available for this location. Also the request may automatically include if a map exists a query regarding the resolution of the map. Further the map check request can query whether the map is configurable or editable by a user such as to define a higher resolution for the map and or replace the map and or and define redefine parameters associated with the map. It is noted that such parameters can include but are not limited to grid numbers and tile sizes of the map.

With regards to in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention the server can be incorporated in a network node of the wireless communication network to which the UE may be associated such as the server E and E or the server can be external to the wireless communication network such as the server as illustrated in . In the latter case the client application E may communicate with the server via the wireless communication network such as over paths or or the client application E may communicate with the server directly via the other network such as via the Internet. Further in accordance with the exemplary embodiments the UE may communicate with the server via the other network using a connection which may include a wired and or wireless connection to the other network .

The server checks existing map data against the location data within a database or memory associated with the server . If a map exists the map is retrieved from the server and the user location is identified within a defined boundary of the map by the client application E displayed on the graphical display interface . In this example the client application E receives a response message from the server which indicates that the map exists. Further the client application E receives in the same message or in a separate message a response from the server which includes information regarding the existing map. The existing map message and the map information is received with the UE Further in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention the UI of the client application E visually displays to the user of the client application E an indication of the existing map message. Further in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention the map information includes information regarding whether or not the map can be modified by the user. Such an indication can include an indication of whether the server has accepted the resolution for the map. If the server has accepted the resolution for the map then the resolution of the map is not modifiable by the user. However if the map information from the server indicates that the map is able to be modified then the user can use the client application E to modify the map at least as stated above. Further in accordance with the embodiments the user can if desired upload the modified map to the server with the client application E. In addition in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention the client application E can render the map using only mapping data from the server. Further if it is determined that the map can be configured by the client application E with a better resolution then the client application E can indicate this to the server as well as the user. The client application E may then receive a response from the server of whether or not such a modification would be accepted by the server. The client application E will also indicate this response from the server to the user via the UI of the client application E.

With the client application E open the user performs a scan of the location where the user is currently positioned. The scan can be performed by the user with the UE by waving the UE in the air using one or more different motions while directing or pointing the UE towards the location to be scanned. The wave motion which may be referred to as a gestural action can be a semicircular motion a full 360 circle a straight motion from one end to another and or other motions. During the one or more wave motions the client application E records accelerometer and or gyroscope data such as is performed using the data from the accel gyro function of the UE . Using a sensor inference algorithm the client application E determines the motion that the user has performed.

Referring to which illustrates the user interface of the client application E the user is then presented a set of tiles displayed by the client application E on the graphical display interface . Each tile of the tiles has a different resolution. The user then selects a tile of the tiles such as by touching thereby selecting on a touch screen or using a pointer of some sort or mouse clicking on one tile of the set of tiles or by selecting a hard or soft key of the device that is associated with the tile. The selected tile is used by the client application E to build the map at a resolution of the tile selected by the user. In a non limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention the selected resolution is displayed somewhere on UI of the client application E. As an example the selected resolution can be displayed in any of the blocks and or any other location on the UI of the client application E. In addition it is note that the blocks illustrated in are not limiting. For example one or more of the blocks and may be located in different locations of the UI of the client application E. In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention an indicator may be used to identify a block area such as the block immediate front center of the stage and or the area at the back of the stage that is not allowed to be entered by a user. Further it is noted that in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention the block of the UI and or the tiles shown in the block are dynamically created by the client application E based on at least a particular type of wave motion gesture performed by the user of the UE as described in more detail below. In addition in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention the user desired resolution can be pre determined such as by settings on the client application E or default settings by the user of the client application E.

Now based on the one or more wave motions gestural actions that the user has performed and the selected resolution the client application E builds a map for the user. The map includes an indication of the user at the location. As an example a circular motion will show a circle built with the tiles with the user at the center. The user position can be indicated via a small indicator on the user interface of the client application E which is displayed on the graphical display interface . Further in accordance with the exemplary embodiments as illustrated in for a horizontal motion a grid layout for the map is built with the tiles such that a stage is shown with an indicator depicting the user s position at the center of the grid layout and facing the stage . This facing by the user may also be shown on the map with an arrow as produced by the user with the client application user interface UI . In addition in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention each type of wave motion gesture can be identified with its own particular type of layout.

In addition the user can change the layout if desired by choosing from different layouts shown by the client application UI as shown in block . The different layouts can be ordered according to a probability based on the wave motion. The user can also use the client application UI to change their relative position shown on the grid as well as a direction of the user. Further the user can use the client application UI to zoom in to the grid layout and also to change their position on a tile without jumping to another tile.

In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention the user of the UE can configure using the client application different indicators for different blocks and or tiles of the built map. Such indicators can convey information such as whether or not a user is allowed to enter a particular area defined by a blocks and or tile. Further such areas can be identified by the client application E using such indicators. For example an indicator can identify an area as astage area a comfort room or a parking area etc. In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention as similarly stated above with regards to the client application UI can be used to provide such an indicator to convey that the block in the immediate front center of the stage and the back of the stage are not allowed to be entered by a user. It is noted that the indicators can be customized by a user with the client application E so as to be any shape and or color desired by the user. Additionally areas and or blocks and or features of the map can be configured with sounds such as personalized sounds and or event sounds and or names of people places to name only a few. These sounds can be initiated by moving a mouse pointer over a location on the map and or the sounds can be played based on a location of the user with respect to a location depicted by the map such as to direct the user of the map to a particular person place or feature of the location. This can be accomplished by the client application E using data from GPS A GPS function or other location based functions of the user s device. Further the user may personalize this indicator as well as any one or more blocks of the maps. For example the user may decide to incorporate still frame or animated pictures videos as an indicator and or as a background of any feature block and or space on the map. In addition business logos or advertisements may be incorporated into the map. These logos and or advertisements can be customized based on a location of a user who downloads a map in accordance with the exemplary embodiments. This also can be accomplished by the client application E using data from GPS A GPS function or other location based functions of the UE . Further any of these features customizations can be incorporated into the map when the map is being built by the client application E and or into a map that is retrieved by the user with the client application E and or by an authorized third party with some type of access to the server such as by agreement with a service provider and or operator. The server and or the service provider and or operator can reserve the right to remove add and or replace any such map customizations. Further the exemplary embodiments of the invention can be beneficial to operators and or service providers as they can sell such services to for example users and businesses to enable such customizations of the maps.

In addition with the client application E the user can select one or more blocks and then place those blocks on the map for example by dragging and dropping over a touch screen of the UE . This feature is beneficial for at least the reason that the user is enabled to build a more complete map which identifies location information not found in maps of conventional location based applications. Further these defined blocks and or tiles are incorporated in the built map uploaded to the server such as for use by the server to identify to other users areas of the location where a user presence is not allowed. Further based on these types of indications by the client application E the server can provide notifications and or error indications such as for corrections needed in location layouts of uploaded maps to other users.

Each tile shown to the user has a default set of properties. Once a map is made a grid base of the map is constructed. The grid base acts as the base on which tiles are pasted. The grid base uses a coordinate system with the top left corner having the value 0 0 or two dimensions. It is noted that the exemplary embodiments of the invention enable the grid base and the coordinate system of the client application to reflect 3 dimensions as well. All slots on the grid are then numbered relative to an origin slot. The number of tiles used corresponds exactly to the number of slots on the grid layout. The grid layout can be represented as a vector set of coordinates and the client can reconstruct the map given the coordinate set.

Each tile used in the grid layout has a set of properties. The properties of a tile are caused to be displayed by the client application E by selecting the tile and performing a right mouse click on the tile or by pressing on the tile such as with a touchscreen user interface for a predetermined period of time. It is noted that the period of time for this pressing to result in a display of the tile properties is a configurable threshold value of seconds which may be defined by a manufacturer and or by a user with the client application E. The displayed property information presents to the user meta information about the tile such as the meta information of . The meta information provides an estimated size of the tile in any measurable quantity selected by the user such as meters. Further the layout pane of the client application E can be selected to enter an edit mode where the user can choose either a preset size for the tile or manually enter change information regarding a size of a tile as indicated in the meta information for example. Also after a map grid layout is shown on the client user interface the user can add or remove rows and columns from the layout. It is noted that any or the above described embodiments can be performed by user selection via the graphical display interface which can be a touch screen and or an associated keypad. In addition the client application enables the user to drag and drop objects such as tiles columns and or rows to or from locations of the map and or grid layout. In addition the client user interface provides edit options such as to add rows and add columns so that the user can add or provide number of rows to insert and number of tiles used in each row and or column or similarly remove tiles used in a row and or column. Further these edit mode operations will cause the client application E to automatically update or change the coordinate data of block and the meta information according to any changes. It is noted that the coordinate data is not editable by the user and is always assigned by the client application E. The user can also replace any tile with tiles of other shapes.

In another embodiment the client application E with the features of the device as described above can also apply a distance through depth estimation algorithm to a map layout acquired using the wave motion or gestural action with the UE . Through depth estimation an estimate is made that provides size information of the tiles that are used as well as more accurate indications of the user s position in the formulated map. In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the invention a size of the map can be estimated based on for example a particular panning distance of the gestural motion or wave motion performed by the user when scanning the location with the UE and or a speed of the panning motion. For depth estimation of a location or a feature of a location the client application E may use algorithms known in the art and based on the UE or camera position and image s captured determine the depth. In addition it is noted that the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to two dimensional map acquisition and building. The client application E can be used to perform all the novel operations as in accordance with the exemplary embodiments described herein with three dimensional maps and or devices e.g. 3 D cameras as well.

With the grid layout finalized and with the tile numbers and size of tiles defined the client application E infers the size of the map and location of the place using the user location indicated via the layout user location is known through the user s current coordinates . The client application E uploads the grid coordinate vectors the user position and the meta information about the tiles to the server where it can be stored.

In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention the client application E can be used to provide additional information to the server. As one non limiting example the client application can provide dynamic information about an event that is going to happen at that place.
