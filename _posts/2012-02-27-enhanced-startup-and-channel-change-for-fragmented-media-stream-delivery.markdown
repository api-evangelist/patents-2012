The present disclosure relates to enhanced startup and channel change for fragment media stream delivery.

Media streams typically involve encoding or re encoding prior to transmission to devices and users associated with the devices. In many instances media streams are encoded into a format such as MPEG 4 Part 10 or MPEG 4 Part 12. The encoding servers may have the capacity to perform real time live encoding on up to half a dozen media streams simultaneously. Client devices must request the media streams from the servers and performing decoding for playback. A wide variety of activities typically must occur prior to beginning video playback of a media stream on a device.

Conventional mechanisms involve delay prior to playback of fragmented media streams. Consequently the techniques of the present invention provide improved mechanisms for startup and channel change for fragmented media streams to reduce delay and improve user experience.

Reference will now be made in detail to some specific examples of the invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. On the contrary it is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

For example the techniques of the present invention will be described in the context of fragment servers. However it should be noted that the techniques of the present invention may also apply to fragment server variations and media stream servers. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. Particular example embodiments of the present invention may be implemented without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

Various techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity. However it should be noted that some embodiments include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple instantiations of a mechanism unless noted otherwise. For example a system uses a processor in a variety of contexts. However it will be appreciated that a system can use multiple processors while remaining within the scope of the present invention unless otherwise noted. Furthermore the techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes describe a connection between two entities. It should be noted that a connection between two entities does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection as a variety of other entities may reside between the two entities. For example a processor may be connected to memory but it will be appreciated that a variety of bridges and controllers may reside between the processor and memory. Consequently a connection does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection unless otherwise noted.

A media stream delivery system encodes and fragments media streams into numerous media stream fragments maintained on fragment servers. Playlist information media data and bandwidth adaption data is provided as box information with media stream fragments to reduce the number of client requests required to begin playback or perform a channel change. A client no longer needs to make separate requests for bandwidth adaptation data media data or playlist information. Playback can begin as soon as sufficient media stream fragments are received.

A variety of transactions must occur prior to delivery of media streams to devices. A device typically performs a three way handshake with a content server. The device then requests playlist information and receives playlist information request media data and receives media data and optionally requests bandwidth adaptation information and receives bandwidth adaptation information. Furthermore conventional MPEG 4 files require that a player on a device parse the entire header before any of the data can be decoded. Some systems require decoding of an audio portion prior to playback of a video portion. Parsing the entire header or decoding an entire audio portion can take a notable amount of time particularly on devices with limited network and processing resources. Consequently the techniques and mechanisms of the present invention provide a fragmented MPEG 4 framework that allows playback upon receiving a first MPEG 4 file fragment. A second MPEG 4 file fragment can be requested using information included in the first MPEG 4 file fragment. According to various embodiments the second MPEG 4 file fragment requested may be a fragment corresponding to a higher or lower bit rate stream than the stream associated with the first file fragment.

MPEG 4 is an extensible container format that does not have a fixed structure for describing media types. Instead MPEG 4 has an object hierarchy that allows custom structures to be defined for each format. The format description is stored in the sample description stsd box for each stream. The sample description box may include information that may not be known until all data has been encoded. For example the sample description box may include an average bit rate that is not known prior to encoding.

According to various embodiments MPEG 4 files are fragmented so that a live stream can be intelligent encoded in a distributed architecture on dynamically scalable hardware recorded and played back in a close to live manner. MPEG 4 files can be created without having to wait until all content is written to prepare the movie headers. To allow for MPEG 4 fragmentation without out of band signaling a box structure is provided to include synchronization information end of file information and chapter information. According to various embodiments synchronization information is used to synchronize audio and video when playback entails starting in the middle of a stream. End of file information signals when the current program or file is over. This may include information to continue streaming the next program or file. Chapter information may be used for video on demand content that is broken up into chapters possibly separated by advertisement slots.

According to various embodiments box information in a box structure provides information sufficient to respond to conventional playlist information media data and bandwidth adaptation requests. No separate requests for this information are required.

MPEG 4 fragments may be maintained on fragment servers. Devices request fragments from the fragment server in order to reconstruct particular media streams for playback. In some examples fragments correspond to a particular live stream variant that is reconstructed as additional fragments are made available.

According to various embodiments MPEG 4 fragment distribution technology is provided so that a client device only needs HTTP round trip time RTT before the client is receiving audio video data that can be submitted to decoders renders. In particular embodiments MPEG 4 fragment generators interleave audio and video when creating fragments so that audio video content is multiplexed. The client device does not have to receive all of the audio data before it can begin playing the video data. According to various embodiments a client device estimates the bandwidth of the connection being used to connected to the server. If sufficient bandwidth exists so that the client will download the fragment faster than the length of the fragment the client can begin queuing samples for playback. Lower initial bandwidths can be streamed to fill the initial pipeline before switching to higher resolution. This allows buffers to be filled quickly and the client can therefore handle changing network conditions.

After the media stream is delineated into GOPs a work dispatcher is notified that a GOP is available. According to various embodiments the work dispatcher determines if it is the one assigned to work on it as well as what should be done with the GOP. According to various embodiments the work dispatcher may determine that the GOP should be encoded into 8 different variants. In particular embodiments the work dispatcher creates a description of what needs to be done assigns a weight or priority level to the job and sends the job to job queues . According to various embodiments job queues are first in first out FIFO queues that are empty most of the time. Encoders fraggers request jobs and obtain them from the job queues . According to various embodiments jobs may be ordered in a job queue based on weight. In particular embodiments encoders fraggers may select higher priority jobs first from the job queues.

In particular embodiments different priority jobs are placed in different priority job queues. Multiple jobs may be taken from the higher priority job queues before a single job is taken from the lower priority job queues. According to various embodiments highest priority jobs are processed before lower priority jobs. In particular embodiments queues are assigned percentage of service values. A high priority queue may get serviced 40 of the time. A medium priority queue 30 of the time and the remaining queues 20 and 10 of the time by the encoders fraggers. According to various embodiments hundreds or thousands of encoders fraggers reside in a system. In particular embodiments the same device performs both encoding and fragmentation but it should be noted that separated devices can be used to perform these operations. According to various embodiments additional encoder fraggers can be dynamically brought online when resource usage reaches a particular threshold. Alternatively encoder fraggers can be taken offline when resources usage falls beneath a particular floor. According to various embodiments encoder fragger is a virtual machine that may reside on one or more physical servers that may or may not have specialized encoding hardware. In particular embodiments a cloud service determines how many of these virtual machines to use based on established thresholds.

According to various embodiments a unique identifier is provided for each GOP and a log of each step is maintained. After the encoder fragger completes processing a job and outputs an encoded fragment the encoded fragment is maintained in distributed and redundant storage . In one example distributed and redundant storage is a virtualized scale out network attached storage system. The distributed and redundant storage allows a system to maintain numerous fragments on any number of virtualized storage devices.

According to various embodiments fragments on distributed and redundant storage are accessible by fragment server . The fragment server provides the caching layer with fragments for clients. The design philosophy behind the client server API minimizes round trips and reduces complexity as much as possible when it comes to delivery of the media data to a client device. The fragment server provides live streams and or DVR configurations.

According to various embodiments a client device uses a media component that requests fragmented MPEG 4 files allows trick play and manages bandwidth adaptation. In particular embodiments bandwidth adaptation information playlist information and media data is included in a box structure generated by the box structure generated by encoder fragger . In particular embodiments a device application on a client device performs a transport control protocol 3 way handshake with the fragment server to initiate a connection to receive a media stream. According to various embodiments instead of the device application requesting bandwidth adaption information playlist information and media data in separate transactions from the fragment server the bandwidth adaptation information playlist information and media data may be embedded in a box structure provided with the media stream fragments by the fragment server. In some examples the box structure may be provided with first fragment.

After the media stream is delineated into GOPs an elastic load balancer is used to distribute work to work dispatchers and . According to various embodiments a live stream variant encoding manager monitors live stream variant consumption. If particular variant are not being consumed jobs for creating those variants are no longer performed. If particular not yet available variants are requested then jobs creating those variants can be generated by the work dispatcher at the request of the live stream variant encoding manager . If a work dispatcher fails right as it takes a notification another notification occurs to a different work dispatcher. Two notifications for the same GOP will end up on two different machines. At each work dispatcher and there may also be a proxy. According to various embodiments the GOP delineator resides on a different data center than the work dispatchers and . Using proxies at work dispatchers and allows for a single transfer of a media stream GOP between data centers.

According to various embodiments the work dispatchers and determine characteristics of a particular job and what should be done with the GOP. According to various embodiments the work dispatchers and may determine that the GOP should be encoded into 8 different variants. In particular embodiments the work dispatchers and create descriptions of what needs to be done and send jobs to job queues . According to various embodiments job queues include an active job queue and a standby job queue. According to various embodiments job queues are first in first out FIFO queues that are empty most of the time. Timeouts may be associated with each job in the queue. Encoders fraggers and request jobs and obtain them from the job queues . In particular embodiments encoders fraggers and are identical and can be dynamically activated or deactivated. According to various embodiments hundreds or thousands of encoders fraggers reside in a system.

In particular embodiments the same device performs both encoding and fragmentation but it should be noted that separated devices can be used to perform these operations. According to various embodiments additional encoder fraggers can be dynamically brought online when resource usage reaches a particular threshold. Alternatively encoder fraggers can be taken offline when resources usage falls beneath a particular floor. According to various embodiments encoder fragger and is a virtual machine that may reside on one or more physical servers that may or may not have specialized encoding hardware. In particular embodiments a cloud service determines how many of these virtual machines to use based on established thresholds.

According to various embodiments encoders fraggers and are stateless. According to various embodiments a unique identifier is provided for each GOP and a log of each step is maintained. If a particular encoder fragger fails at any point in the process another encoder fragger can perform encoding and fragmentation operations. After the encoders fraggers and complete the jobs and generate encoded fragments the encoded fragments are maintained in distributed and redundant storage . In one example distributed and redundant storage is a virtualized scale out network attached storage system. The distributed and redundant storage includes nodes and allowing a system to maintain numerous fragments on any number of virtualized storage devices.

According to various embodiments fragments on distributed and redundant storage are accessible by fragment servers and . The fragment servers and provide a caching layer with fragments for clients. The design philosophy behind the client server API minimizes round trips and reduces complexity as much as possible when it comes to delivery of the media data to a client device. The fragment servers and provide live streams and or DVR configurations. According to various embodiments fragment servers also operate without state. In particular embodiments fragments servers operate using HTTP get requests. According to various embodiments each process allows a flow to continue without having a centralized control point. An elastic load balancer distributes fragment requests from a cloud front provided to devices and . According to various embodiments devices and monitor and analyze media streams to determine what fragments should be cached. In some examples devices and cache any fragment that has been determined to be redundant to any fragment previously requested. Fragments can be compared using identifiers hashes etc.

According to various embodiments a client device uses a media component that requests fragmented MPEG 4 files allows trick play and manages bandwidth adaptation. In particular embodiments bandwidth adaptation information playlist information and media data is included in a box structure generated by the box structure generated by encoder fraggers and . In particular embodiments a device application and or perform a transport control protocol 3 way handshake with fragment servers and or to initiate a connection to receive a media stream. According to various embodiments instead of the device application or requesting bandwidth adaption information playlist information and media data in separate transactions from the fragment servers and or the bandwidth adaptation information playlist information and media data may be embedded in a box structure provided with the media stream fragments by the fragment server. In some examples the box structure may be provided with first fragment.

According to various embodiments a client device then requests media data playlist information and bandwidth adaptation information from the server. Each of these requests may entail as separate HTTP request and response. The client device then requests the actual media stream. In particular embodiments all audio must be received prior to playback. However the techniques of the present invention provide a media stream box structure that includes playlist information media data and bandwidth adaptation information. Instead of making separate requests prior to obtaining an initial fragment the box structure may be provided in one or more initial fragments. According to various embodiments the client device requests an initial fragment at . The fragment server responds with a fragment including box information at . The fragment may include multiplexed video and audio along with playlist media data and bandwidth adaptation that is extracted at . In particular embodiments the quality of the video and audio in the initial fragment is reduced to accommodate additional playlist media data and bandwidth adaptation data.

According to various embodiments the fragment writer includes an option which encrypts fragments to ensure stream security during the recording process. The fragment writer will request an encoding key from the license manager. The keys used are similar to that done for DRM. The encoding format is slightly different where MOOF is encoded. The encryption occurs once so that it does not create prohibitive costs during delivery to clients.

According to various embodiments the fragment server uses a REST API that is cache friendly so that most requests made to the fragment server can be cached. The fragment server uses cache control headers and ETag headers to provide the proper hints to caches. This API also provides the ability to understand where a particular user stopped playing and to start play from that point providing the capability for pause on one device and resume on another .

According to various embodiments the client includes an application logic component and a media rendering component. The application logic component presents the UI for the user and also communicates to the front end server to get shows that are available for the user and to authenticate. As part of this process the server returns URLs to media assets that are passed to the media rendering component.

In particular embodiments the client relies on the fact that each fragment in a fragmented MPEG 4 file has a sequence number. Using this knowledge and a well defined URL structure for communicating with the server the client requests fragments individually as if it was reading separate files from the server simply by requesting URLs for files associated with increasing sequence numbers. In some embodiments the client can request files corresponding to higher or lower bit rate streams depending on device and network resources.

Since each fragment contains the information needed to create the URL for the next file no special playlist files are needed and all actions startup channel change seeking can be performed with a single HTTP request. After each fragment is downloaded the client assesses among other things the size of the fragment and the time needed to download it in order to determine if downshifting is needed or if there is enough bandwidth available to request a higher bitrate.

Because each request to the server looks like a request to a separate file the response to requests can be cached in any HTTP Proxy or be distributed over any HTTP based CDN.

Particular examples of interfaces supports include Ethernet interfaces frame relay interfaces cable interfaces DSL interfaces token ring interfaces and the like. In addition various very high speed interfaces may be provided such as fast Ethernet interfaces Gigabit Ethernet interfaces ATM interfaces HSSI interfaces POS interfaces FDDI interfaces and the like. Generally these interfaces may include ports appropriate for communication with the appropriate media. In some cases they may also include an independent processor and in some instances volatile RAM. The independent processors may control such communications intensive tasks as packet switching media control and management.

According to various embodiments the system is a fragment server that also includes a transceiver streaming buffers and a program guide database. The fragment server may also be associated with subscription management logging and report generation and monitoring capabilities. In particular embodiments functionality for allowing operation with mobile devices such as cellular phones operating in a particular cellular network and providing subscription management. According to various embodiments an authentication module verifies the identity of devices including mobile devices. A logging and report generation module tracks mobile device requests and associated responses. A monitor system allows an administrator to view usage patterns and system availability. According to various embodiments the fragment server handles requests and responses for media content related transactions while a separate streaming server provides the actual media streams.

Although a particular fragment server is described it should be recognized that a variety of alternative configurations are possible. For example some modules such as a report and logging module and a monitor may not be needed on every server. Alternatively the modules may be implemented on another device connected to the server. In another example the server may not include an interface to an abstract buy engine and may in fact include the abstract buy engine itself. A variety of configurations are possible.

In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of invention.
