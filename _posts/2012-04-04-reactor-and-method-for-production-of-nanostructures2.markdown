This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 248 731 filed Oct. 9 2008 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 978 673 filed Oct. 9 2007 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by this reference.

The invention was made with U.S. Government support under grant number W9113M 04 C 0024 awarded by the U.S. Army Space Missile Defense Command grant number DE FG36 05G085013A awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy and grant number DE FG02 05ER64071 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to the field of nanotechnology and more particularly to a reactor and method for the production of nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles.

Nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles can have unique applications and are beginning to be used in electronics optoelectronics electrochemical cells nanoelectromechanical devices catalysis and several other fields. Unique properties of nanowires include high aspect ratio low conductivity high surface to volume ratio and enhanced material characteristics due to quantum confinement effects. Synthesis of bulk quantities of nanowires with controlled composition crystallinity and morphology is important to continued development and commercialization of nanowire technology. For many applications nanowire quantities of several grams or more are needed. Similarly bulk production of nanoparticles are needed.

Metal oxide nanowires have been synthesized in a variety of ways. Some of these methods include i direct plasma and thermal oxidation using hydrogen and oxygen containing gas phase of low melting metal melts supplied through the gas phase onto a substrate ii chemical vapor transport of metal using hot filaments onto substrates using chemical vapor deposition in low oxygen containing atmospheres iii exposure of metal foils to low pressure weakly ionized fully dissociated cold oxygen plasmas iv chemical vapor deposition of metal oxides in the presence of catalysts e.g. iron metal particles v thermal evaporation synthesis of zinc oxide nanowires and vi synthesis of zinc oxide nanowires using a radio frequency RF high power plasma.

Many of the previously described approaches involve nanowire synthesis on a substrate. Other approaches have used catalysts or high temperature evaporation of a precursor. It can be difficult time consuming and expensive to produce large quantities of nanowires using these methods.

Other approaches such as synthesis of zinc oxide nanowires using an RF high power plasma have not proven the ability to produce nanowires in a consistent efficient and cost effective manner. See Peng et al. Plasma Synthesis of Large Quantities of Zinc Oxide Nanorods 111 194 200 2000 . Attempts to use RF high power plasmas to produce nanowires suffer the drawbacks of requiring high power input high gas flow rates and careful control of reaction temperature gradients. See id. Alternatives to nanowire synthesis which overcome the limitations of the known processes are needed. Similarly alternatives to nanoparticle synthesis which overcome the limitations of the known processes are needed.

The present invention includes a reactor and method for production of nanostructures for example metal oxide nanowires and nanoparticles.

The present invention includes a reactor for producing metal oxide nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles. In one embodiment the reactor comprises a metal powder delivery system wherein the metal powder delivery system includes a funnel in communication with a dielectric tube a plasma forming gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube and configured to deliver a plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into the dielectric tube a sheath gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube and configured to deliver a sheath gas into the dielectric tube and a microwave energy generator coupled to the dielectric tube and configured to deliver microwave energy into the dielectric tube and to the plasma forming gas. In one embodiment the reactor further includes a recycle system to recycle any unreacted metal to a plasma formed in the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the metal powder delivery system is regulated to thereby deliver metal powder at a set and or predetermined flow rate into the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the flow rate is set or fluctuates over time.

In some embodiments the reactor further comprises a product collector that in certain embodiments includes a filter. In some embodiments the filter is oriented longitudinally with respect to the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the product collector further comprises and exhaust.

The present invention also includes a method for producing metal oxide nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles. In some embodiments the method comprises providing a reactor comprising a metal powder delivery system a dielectric tube and a product collector that comprises a filter delivering a plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into the dielectric tube delivering a sheath gas into the dielectric tube forming a plasma from the plasma forming gas by applying microwave energy to the plasma forming gas delivering a metal powder into the dielectric tube reacting the metal powder within the plasma at a certain microwave energy level to form metal oxide nanowires or metal oxide nanoparticles and collecting the metal oxide nanowires or metal oxide nanoparticles. In one embodiment the method further includes delivering a bulk of the metal powder substantially into the center of the plasma. Further embodiments comprise delivering the metal powder into the dielectric tube with a metal powder delivery system at a flow rate that is in some embodiments regulated. Still further embodiments of the method comprise the step of collecting the formed metal oxide nanowires or metal oxide nanoparticles from a collecting cup from a filter that optionally may be located in a product collector and or from the dielectric tube.

The present invention produces bulk quantities of nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles quickly and at a fraction of the cost of known processes for making nanostructures. Practice of the present invention produces bulk quantities of highly pure metal oxide nanostructures using a high throughput plasma reactor. By using the reactors and methods described herein nanostructures can be produced very quickly. In some embodiments reacting metal powders into metal oxides nanostructures can take less than one second. For example it can take only about one minute to produce about 10 grams of nanostructures. The reactor and methods described herein can be used to produce nanostructures in quantities of a kilogram or more per day.

The present invention can be used to produce highly pure nanostructure products. Since there is no need for any catalyst substrate or template to produce nanostructures foreign material contamination of the nanostructure product can be avoided or minimized. In contrast nanostructure products made using known synthesis methods often contain materials other than the nanostructure such as catalyst particles. Because the nanostructure products produced by the present invention are highly pure expensive and time consuming purification processes can be minimized or even avoided completely.

The present invention can be used to produce nanostructures more cost effectively than known synthesis methods. For example the present invention does not use high power or high temperatures which are associated with known processes for preparing nanostructures. Reactor designs described herein can be continuously operated for extended periods of time without significant heating of the reactor. Thus the present invention can avoid the expenses associated with high power and high temperature operation. In addition the present invention does not use catalysts substrates or templates and thus can achieve cost savings over known processes that require such materials. Further the present invention can produce nanostructures without using expensive precursor materials such as for example precursor materials used in thermal evaporation processes. The present invention has demonstrated in one embodiment reaction efficiency of about 90 when 100 nm metal powder particles were used.

In some embodiments the present invention uses lower gas volumes than known processes for making nanostructures in the gas phase. A lower gas volume can reduce waste disposal expenses and can also simplify separation procedures used to recover nanostructure products from process gases. Lower gas volumes can also reduce the amount of heat input that is necessary to provide appropriate conditions for making nanostructures.

The reactor of the present invention can be modular and can be easily adapted or modified to suit production needs. Further because the reactor can be modular the reactor can be easily serviced for example by swapping reactor components as needed.

In some embodiments the plasma is formed at pressures at or near atmospheric pressure. Practice of the present invention at or near atmospheric pressure can produce nanostructures without the use of expensive vacuum components.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the reactors and methods of the present invention advantageously provide relatively smooth airflow within the reactor so as to further provide for the superior and efficient production of metal oxide nanoparticles and nanowires having high aspect ratios.

Nanostructures can be described in terms of their longest and shortest dimensions. For example the aspect ratio of a nanostructure is the ratio of a nanostructure s longest dimension to the nanostructure s shortest dimension. Generally a nanoparticle is a nanostructure having an aspect ratio of 1. In some embodiments a nanoparticle is a nanostructure having a diameter of the nanoscale that is from 1 nanometer to hundreds of nanometers but below 1 micron. Generally a nanowire is a nanostructure that has an aspect ratio greater than 1 i.e. the nanoparticle s longest dimension is greater than the particle s shortest dimension. As used herein the term nanowire refers to a nanostructure that has an aspect ratio greater than 1. In some embodiments the nanowires of the present invention have an aspect ratio e.g. an individual or an average aspect ratio of at least 1.5 such as at least about 2. In other embodiments the nanowires of the present invention have an aspect ratio e.g. an individual or an average aspect ratio of at least about 10 at least about 50 or at least about 75 for example the nanowires can have an aspect ratio of about 10 to about 150 or about 50 to about 125 such as about 100. In some instances the nanowires can have a length ranging from about 1 to about 100 microns such as for example about 10 microns and a diameter of about 15 to about 200 nanometers nm such as for example about 100 nanometers.

As the term is used herein nanowires can include individually separate nanowires as well as intertwined or connected nanowires. For example in one embodiment of the invention nanowires are joined together or agglomerated to form a star burst shaped mass. See for example described infra.

As the term is used herein nanoparticles can include individually separate nanoparticles as well as connected nanoparticles. For example in one embodiment of the invention nanoparticles are joined together or agglomerated. See for example described infra.

Unless otherwise indicated all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients reaction conditions and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term about. Accordingly unless indicated to the contrary the numerical parameters set forth in this specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the presently disclosed subject matter.

As used herein the term about when referring to a value or to an amount of mass weight time volume concentration or percentage is meant to encompass variations of in some embodiments 20 in some embodiments 10 in some embodiments 5 in some embodiments 1 in some embodiments 0.5 and in some embodiments 0.1 from the specified amount as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed method.

The present invention includes a reactor for producing metal oxide nanostructures. In one embodiment the reactor includes a metal powder delivery system wherein the metal powder delivery system includes a funnel in communication with a dielectric tube a plasma forming gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube whereby a plasma forming gas is delivered substantially longitudinally into the dielectric tube a sheath gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube whereby a sheath gas is delivered into the dielectric tube and a microwave energy generator coupled to the dielectric tube whereby microwave energy is delivered into the dielectric tube and to the plasma forming gas.

As the term is used herein longitudinally or longitudinal means along the major or long axis as opposed to latitudinal which means along the width transverse or across. For example in one embodiment of the invention plasma forming gas is delivered substantially into and along the length of the dielectric tube.

In one embodiment of the present invention the metal powder delivery system can be regulated. As used herein the term regulate or regulated generally refers to the capability to be tuned to a set or predetermined value. In the context of metal powder delivery systems regulated refers to a metal powder delivery systems that can be tuned to deliver metal powder at a set or predetermined flow rate. For example in some embodiments a metal powder delivery system is regulated to deliver metal powder to a reactor at 1 to 600 grams per hour. In some embodiments the metal powder delivery system is calibrated so that a user can regulate the flow rate to a predetermined value. In some embodiments the regulated flow rate is constant over time. In one embodiment of the present invention the regulated metal powder delivery system can be chosen from powder feeder PF 700 or PF 3350 Plasma Powders and Systems Inc. Marlboro N.J. .

With further regard to the regulation of the metal powder delivery systems of the present invention in some embodiments regulating the flow of metal powder into the delivery system allows for the production of metal oxide nanoparticles and nanowires continuously. In one embodiment the regulated metal powder delivery system contributes to the reactor s ability to produce nanoparticles and nanowires of relatively uniform dimensions. Without being bound by theory or mechanism in certain embodiments it is believed that this increased uniformity can be due to the regulation of the delivery of the metal powder producing a consistent stream of metal powder to the plasma thereby reducing potential disruptions to the plasma.

The dielectric tube can be made of any one of several dielectric materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example in one embodiment dielectric tube is a quartz tube or a tube of a related material. In other embodiments dielectric tube is a ceramic or a related material. Dielectric tube can have an inside diameter for example of about 1 millimeter mm to about 60 mm such as about 5 to about 10 mm about 10 to about 65 mm about 10 to about 50 mm about 10 to about 40 mm about 15 to about 25 mm about 15 to about 35 mm about 20 to about 25 mm or about 20 to about 30 mm. Without being held to any particular theory it is believed that the diameter of the dielectric tube is important so that the plasma described in more detail infra distributes uniformly within the tube. Preferably the plasma should occupy a large portion of the tube s cross section without touching or melting the tube. It is thought that a dielectric tube that is substantially larger in diameter than the plasma formed within can result in substantial quantities of unreacted metal powder during operation of the reactor.

In some instances the diameter of the dielectric tube changes as a function of the tube s length. For example the diameter of the dielectric tube can be smaller in the section of the tube in which a plasma is generated and larger downstream of the plasma. In one embodiment the inside diameter of the dielectric tube is about 22 mm in the section of the tube in which a plasma is generated and is about 10 centimeters cm in diameter further downstream. It is thought that by increasing the diameter of the dielectric tube downstream of the plasma wall deposition of particles can be reduced. In some instances however the diameter of the dielectric tube can be chosen to encourage deposition of particles on the walls of the dielectric tube. For example relatively small dielectric tube diameters are believed to contribute to increased particle deposition on the walls of the dielectric tube during operation of the reactor.

Dielectric tube can have a length for example of about 20 centimeters cm to about 200 cm. In one particular embodiment dielectric tube has a length of about 75 cm. Proper orientation of dielectric tube can be determined depending on the particular process requirements. In one instance dielectric tube can be vertical. In other instances dielectric tube can be angled or horizontal.

Sheath gas inlets and are in communication with dielectric tube and can be used to deliver a sheath gas to dielectric tube . In another embodiment sheath gas inlets and can be configured to deliver either a sheath gas or a plasma forming gas or both a sheath gas and a plasma forming gas to dielectric tube . Sheath gas inlet and sheath gas inlet can be angled with respect to a longitudinal axis of the dielectric tube. In some instances only one of sheath gas inlet or sheath gas inlet is angled with respect to a longitudinal axis of the dielectric tube. For example one or both gas inlets can be angled at less than 90 such as at about 10 to about 80 about 15 to about 75 about 20 to about 70 about 25 to about 65 about 30 to about 60 about 40 to about 50 such as about 45 about 42 about 44 about 46 or about 48 with respect to a longitudinal axis of the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the angle of a gas inlet can produce a helical gas path in the dielectric tube when gas is delivered through the gas inlet. For example the angle of a gas inlet can produce a helical sheath gas path in the dielectric tube when sheath gas is delivered through the gas inlet. A helical sheath gas path in the dielectric tube can help to contain the plasma and keep the dielectric tube cool during operation of the reactor.

Microwave energy generator can include for example magnetron circulator power detector e.g. a forward and reflected power detector tuner e.g. a three stub tuner and load . Microwave energy generator can be coupled to dielectric tube via coupler . In one embodiment coupler is a tapered waveguide which surrounds dielectric tube . Microwave energy produced by microwave energy generator is delivered to dielectric tube via coupler . In some embodiments microwave energy generator produces microwave energy at 2.45 gigahertz GHz .

Microwave energy produced by microwave energy generator is delivered to the plasma forming gas contained in dielectric tube to produce plasma . With reference to in some embodiments a device such as holder is used to hold dielectric tube .

Referring again to in one embodiment reactor includes a recycle. For example reactor can include recycle system in communication with dielectric tube . In one embodiment recycle system is also in communication with a plasma forming gas inlet. Recycle system can also include a nanostructure separator. A nanostructure separator such as for example a cyclone can be used to remove completely or partially nanostructures from a reaction product stream exiting the bottom of dielectric tube before unreacted metal is recycled to the plasma.

Reactor can also include a nanostructure product collector such as product gathering cup . In some embodiments the nanostructure product collector contains a baffle or other device to slow gas velocity and disentrain nanostructure product from the reaction product stream. In another embodiment the nanostructure product collector is a powder collecting cup wherein the diameter of the powder collecting cup is less than the inner diameter of the dielectric tube so that gases can escape from the bottom of the powder collecting cup. In additional embodiments a powder collecting cup is porous to the gases so that the gases can escape through the powder collecting cup. Excesses gases can be vented for example via exhaust line .

In one embodiment reactor includes inlet port for introducing a precursor feed for downstream reaction. For example inlet port can be used to introduce a precursor feed for thin film formation.

In one embodiment reactor does not contain any additional heating elements or any additional heat insulating materials. For example in some embodiments dielectric tube is not covered with heat insulation. In additional embodiments reactor does not contain any igniters to ignite the plasma. For example reactor does not contain any ignition device to ignite the plasma. In one particular embodiment microwave energy produced by microwave energy generator is delivered to dielectric tube via coupler and the microwave energy is capable of igniting the plasma. In another embodiment a metal ignition rod with pointed ends not illustrated is used to ignite the plasma.

Referring now to in another embodiment of the present invention a reactor is provided that comprises a regulated metal powder delivery system a microwave energy generator a dielectric tube and a product collector that has a filter and an exhaust . Among other things the filter and exhaust are configured so that the reactor has a relatively smooth air flow and a low pressure drop. Smooth air flow and low pressure drops reduce the potential for disruptions to the plasma jet or the flow characteristics of the metal powder which minimizes the negative impacts on nanoparticle and nanowire characteristics that may be attributed to such disruptions.

Referring now to in yet another embodiment of the present invention a reactor is provided that includes a regulated metal powder delivery system and a product collector that has a filter arranged so that surface of the filter is perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the dielectric tube . As shown in the filter is arranged cylindrically around for example a cylindrical wire structure and the side of the filter opposing the dielectric tube further comprises a filter bag . The filter bag is configured to gather nanostructures that do not pass through and do not adhere to the filter for example. Such embodiments allow for relatively large filter surface areas which also can contribute to smooth air flow and low pressure drop. In such embodiments nanoparticles or nanowires that are produced by the reactor can collect either on the surface of the vertical filter or fall from the filter into the filter bag . The filtered air can then exit the product collector via an exhaust .

Of course the surface of a filter may be configured at any angle relative a longitudinal direction of the dielectric tube. For example in the exemplary embodiment shown in the cylindrical filters are arranged perpendicularly to a longitudinal direction from the dielectric tube so that the surface of the filters are parallel to the longitudinal direction from the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the filter surface is perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the dielectric tubes. In other embodiments the filter is angled with respect to a longitudinal direction of the dielectric tube by about 10 about 20 about 30 about 40 about 50 about 60 about 70 or about 80 . In some embodiments the product collectors including the filters can also include other collection mechanisms such as collection cups traps and the like to further assist in collecting the nanostructures.

The filters used in accordance with the present invention can be comprised of any material suitable for filtering and collecting metal oxide nanoparticles and nanowires. One of skill in the art will appreciate that different materials will affect air flow and pressure drop within a reactor to varying degrees. Non limiting examples of filters include high efficiency particular air filters made of for example paper glass fibers polymer fibers and the like. Filters be of any shape and may be planar cylindrical or tubular for example and may have any surface shape such as a ridged shape a grooved shape or a smooth shape.

Additionally with regard to the dimensions of a product collector the filter and the exhausts of the reactors of the present invention product collectors filters and exhausts having various shapes and sizes can be used in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter and can be selected for a particular application as desired. In certain embodiments the product collector is a cylinder with a diameter of about 5 inches to about 25 inches and a length of about 10 inches to about 50 inches. In some embodiments the filter is configured in a cylindrical fashion with a diameter ranging from about 2 inches to about 12 inches a length ranging from about 8 inches to about 48 inches. In certain embodiments the reactors comprise an exhaust of any dimension that insures proper dynamics within the reactor. In some embodiments the exhaust comprises a diameter of about 1 to about 2 inches.

In one aspect the present invention also includes a reactor for forming nanostructures from a precursor such as for example a metal organic precursor or a carbon nanotube precursor. For example a reactor for producing nanostructures from a precursor can comprise a precursor delivery system wherein the precursor delivery system includes a funnel in communication with a dielectric tube a plasma forming gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube whereby a plasma forming gas is delivered substantially longitudinally into the dielectric tube a sheath gas inlet also in communication with the dielectric tube whereby a sheath gas is delivered into the dielectric tube and a microwave energy generator coupled to the dielectric tube whereby microwave energy is delivered into the dielectric tube and to the plasma forming gas. Suitable components and configuration for such a reactor are described supra with respect to the reactor for producing metal oxide nanostructures. In one embodiment the precursor delivery system can be substantially the same as the metal powder delivery system described herein.

The present invention also includes a method for producing metal oxide nanostructures. In some embodiments the method includes providing a reactor comprising a metal powder delivery system a dielectric tube and a product collector that comprises a filter delivering a plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into a dielectric tube delivering a sheath gas into the dielectric tube forming a plasma from the plasma forming gas by applying microwave energy to the plasma forming gas delivering a metal powder into the dielectric tube reacting the metal powder within the plasma to form metal oxide nanostructures and collecting the metal oxide nanostructures.

As used herein the terms provide providing and the like refer to obtaining a reactor manufacturing a reactor or offering a reactor. Thus in one embodiment providing refers to a person or entity obtaining a reactor to form nanostructures. In some embodiments providing refers to a person or entity manufacturing a reactor that can make nanostructures. In still further embodiments providing refers to a person or entity offering a reactor to be used. In some embodiments the step of providing a reactor refers to selecting a particular reactor to be used.

The methods for producing metal oxide nanostructures described herein involve the production of nanostructures directly in the vapor phase without the need for any catalyst substrate or template. Nanostructures can be formed of metal oxides such as for example tin oxide zinc oxide tungsten oxide titanium dioxide iron oxide gallium oxides indium oxides bismuth oxides niobium pentoxide aluminum oxides vanadium pentoxide cooper oxides alloy oxides and the like and combinations thereof by using the appropriate metal feed. The methods and reactor described herein can also be used to produce sulfide and nitride nanostructures using for example an appropriate gas phase chemistry feed. In addition carbon nanotubes CNT can be formed using the methods and reactor described herein for example using iron and hydrocarbon species in a vapor phase feed.

A method for producing metal oxide nanostructures can include delivering a plasma forming gas into a dielectric tube. In one embodiment a method for producing metal oxide nanostructures includes delivering a plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into a dielectric tube. Delivering the plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into a dielectric tube can help to keep the plasma centered in the dielectric tube. In some embodiments the plasma forming gas is delivered in a helical gas path into the dielectric tube. The plasma forming gas can include for example argon gas. The plasma forming gas can also include an oxidative gas such as oxygen. In some instances the plasma forming gas can include water vapor. In some embodiments the plasma forming gas can include hydrogen gas.

In some embodiments the plasma forming gas is delivered into the dielectric tube at a flow rate of less than about 10 slpm for example about 1 to about 5 slpm about 2 to about 4 slpm or about 2 slpm. In one embodiment the diameter of the dielectric tube is about 22 mm in diameter thus in some embodiments the plasma forming gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce a plasma forming gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 26.3 meters min m min for example about 2.6 to about 13.2 m min about 5.3 to about 10.5 m min or about 5.3 m min at standard conditions. In some instances the plasma forming gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce a plasma forming gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 30 m min for example about 2 to about 15 m min about 5 to about 10 m min or about 5 m min at standard conditions. The plasma forming gas can include an oxidative gas such as for example oxygen gas. In some embodiments an oxidative gas is delivered into the dielectric tube at a flow rate of equal to or less than about 500 sccm for example about 10 to about 500 sccm 20 to about 400 sccm 30 to about 300 sccm about 50 to about 200 sccm about 75 to about 150 sccm 50 to about 150 sccm or about 100 sccm. In one embodiment the diameter of the dielectric tube is about 22 mm in diameter thus in some embodiments the oxidative gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce a oxidative gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 1.3 m min for example about 0.03 to about 1.3 m min about 0.1 to about 0.5 m min about 0.2 to about 0.4 m min or about 0.26 m min at standard conditions. In some instances the oxidative gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce an oxidative gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 2 m min for example about 0.01 to about 1.5 m min about 0.1 to about 0.5 m min or about 0.2 to about 0.4 m min at standard conditions.

Suitable dielectric tubes for use in the method are described supra. In one particular embodiment the dielectric tube is made of quartz.

A method for producing metal oxide nanostructures can further include delivering a sheath gas into the dielectric tube. Use of a sheath gas can allow the operation of a plasma inside the dielectric tube for extended periods of time. The sheath gas can include for example air or nitrogen. In one particular embodiment the sheath gas is air. The sheath gas can be delivered into the dielectric tube to form a helical sheath gas path. A helical sheath gas path in the dielectric tube can help to contain the plasma and keep the dielectric tube cool during operation of the reactor. Examples of suitable apparatus for producing a helical sheath gas path are described supra.

In some embodiments the sheath gas is delivered into the dielectric tube at a flow rate of less than about 10 slpm for example about 1 to about 8 slpm about 3 to about 6 slpm about 4 to about 5 slpm or about 5 slpm. In one embodiment the diameter of the dielectric tube is about 22 mm in diameter thus in some embodiments the sheath gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce a sheath gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 26.3 m min for example about 2.6 to about 21 m min about 7.9 to about 15.8 m min about 10.5 to about 13.2 m min or about 13.2 m min at standard conditions. In some instances the sheath gas is delivered into the dielectric tube to produce a sheath gas velocity within the dielectric tube of less than about 30 m min for example about 1 to about 25 m min about 5 to about 20 m min or about 10 to about 15 m min at standard conditions.

In addition a plasma forming gas can be delivered to the dielectric tube concurrently with a sheath gas. For example a plasma forming gas and a sheath gas can be mixed and delivered into the dielectric tube to form a helical sheath gas path via for example angled sheath gas inlets. Alternatively a plasma forming gas and a sheath gas can be delivered into the dielectric tube separately to form concurrent helical sheath gas paths via for example separate angled gas inlets. Examples of suitable apparatus for producing a helical sheath gas path are described supra.

A method for producing metal oxide nanostructures can further include forming a plasma from the plasma forming gas by applying microwave energy to the plasma forming gas. In one particular embodiment the microwave energy is 2.45 GHz. In some embodiments the power of microwave energy applied to the plasma forming gas is less than about 15 kilowatts kW less than about 10 kW or less than 8 kW. For example the power of microwave energy applied to the plasma forming gas can be about 300 watts W to about 8 kW such as about 500 W to about 2 kW or about 1 kW to about 1.5 kW. When microwave energy is applied to the plasma forming gas a plasma e.g. a plasma jet can form in the dielectric tube. In one particular embodiment microwave energy is delivered to the dielectric tube via a coupler and the microwave energy is used to ignite the plasma. In another embodiment a metal ignition rod with pointed ends is used to ignite the plasma.

Without being held to any particular theory it is believed that the metal oxide nanowires are formed under molten conditions and not vaporization conditions while nanoparticles are formed when the feed metal is vaporized. Under molten conditions the metal particles are reacted with the plasma at temperatures close to the metal s melting point. The molten metal forms metal oxide nanowires when oxygen reacts with the molten metal. By increasing the microwave power to increase the temperature in the reactor vaporization conditions favorable to forming metal oxide nanoparticles occur. In other words at higher temperatures the metal particles are vaporized into very small nuclei of a few nanometers and during their fall in the quartz tube where the temperature decreases they begin to condense form solid metal oxide nanoparticles and also agglomerate.

Thus a higher microwave power is needed to form nanoparticles compared to nanowire formation for the same feed metal. For example to form titanium metal titania nanoparticles the microwave power is required to be greater than about 1000 W while a microwave power of less than about 1000 and more specifically about 700 W is required to form titanium oxide nanowires in the above described reactors. As another example to form aluminum oxide alumina nanoparticles the microwave power is required to be equal to or greater than about 1300 W while a microwave power of less than about 1300 W and more specifically about 800 W is required to form aluminum oxide nanowires in the above described reactors.

The gas pressure in the dielectric tube can range for example from a few torr to one atmosphere or more. In a specific embodiment the gas pressure in the dielectric tube ranges from a few torr to about one atmosphere. The length of the plasma can be varied by changing the gas flow rates or by changing the microwave power. In some embodiments the length of the plasma in the dielectric tube is about 1 to about 30 cm in length. The length of the plasma in the dielectric tube can be varied to alter the production of nanostructures in the plasma. The flame of the plasma can be stabilized by using a stub tuner and by adjusting the gas flow rates. Typically the gases are introduced to the dielectric tube the plasma is stabilized and the reflected power is minimized. In one aspect the present method includes controlling the plasma uniformity inside the dielectric tube by adjusting the microwave power or the gas flow rates. By adjusting the plasma uniformity or length it is believed that the morphology of the nanostructures and the efficiency of conversion can be adjusted. Generally longer and more uniform plasmas are preferred.

In some embodiments the temperatures of the gases in the reactor do not need to be carefully controlled. For example in one embodiment no heat insulation is used to cover the dielectric tube or to control the temperature of gases in the dielectric tube. Generally the reaction of metal powder to metal oxide nanostructures occurs within the plasma and is complete or substantially complete upon exiting the plasma so that careful control of the gas temperature outside of the plasma can be unnecessary.

Examples of suitable apparatus for applying microwave energy to a plasma forming gas are described supra.

In some instances the plasma forming gas can include hydrogen gas. In one embodiment hydrogen gas is mixed with another plasma forming gas such as argon and then fed to the dielectric tube. In another embodiment hydrogen gas is concurrently fed to the dielectric tube along with another plasma forming gas such as argon. Without being held to any particular theory it is believed that the introduction of hydrogen gas can reduce the microwave power needed to produce nanowires as compared to the same process which does not use hydrogen gas. It is also believed that hydrogen gas plasma can etch nanoparticles or form nanowires and thereby improve the production efficiency or quality of nanostructures.

In one embodiment instead of or in addition to supplying sheath gas and a plasma forming gas such as argon to the dielectric tube water vapor can serve as the plasma forming gas. For example steam can be generated and introduced to the dielectric tube for example in a helical gas flow pattern. Water splitting into species such as H O OH H and Oand also remaining or forming HO can be used to produce high density plasma. In some embodiments such a plasma can form thinner and higher quality nanostructures due to better etching properties of Hand OH.

A method for producing metal oxide nanostructures further includes delivering a metal powder or metal containing precursor into the dielectric tube and reacting the metal powder within the plasma to form metal oxide nanostructures. Appropriate metal powders or metal containing precursors can be selected based upon the desired composition of the nanostructures. Examples of metal powders suitable for use in this invention include tin zinc tungsten titanium iron gallium indium bismuth niobium aluminum vanadium copper alloys and the like and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the powder consists of a particle having a particle diameter of less than about 20 microns such as less than about 15 microns less than about 10 microns less than about 5 microns or less than about 1 micron. Generally relatively small powders result in greater one pass efficiency in the production of nanowires.

In one embodiment metal powder or metal containing precursor is delivered into the dielectric tube via gravity feed and is conveyed into the plasma by gravity. Alternatively the metal powder or metal containing precursor can be delivered into the dielectric tube via pressure e.g. by pressurized gas or via a mechanical dispensing system. In one embodiment the metal powder or metal containing precursor is entrained within the plasma forming gas.

In one embodiment a bulk of the metal powder or metal containing precursor is delivered substantially into the center of the plasma. For example the metal powder can be delivered to the dielectric tube via a funnel such as a conical funnel. By using a funnel to deliver the metal powder the metal powder can be directed into the center of the plasma. In one embodiment the metal powder is delivered into the dielectric tube via a cooled metal powder delivery system.

Examples of suitable apparatus for delivering a metal powder or metal containing precursor into a dielectric tube are also described supra. For example an apparatus such as that shown in B and can be used to deliver a metal powder or metal containing precursor into a dielectric tube. In one embodiment powder is added to conical funnel of cooling jacket and powder delivery system cooling jacket cover and plasma forming gas inlet system is placed over cooling jacket and powder delivery system and gas is supplied via plasma forming gas inlet and used to push the powder through conical funnel into dielectric tube .

In one embodiment the metal powder is delivered into the dielectric tube by a regulated metal powder delivery system. The regulated metal powder delivery system can be regulated by any means including electric or mechanical means. In some embodiments the metal powder delivery system is regulated to deliver metal powder at a predetermined or set flow rate. In some embodiments the flow rate is regulated to provide about 25 grams hour about 50 grams hour about 75 grams hour about 100 grams hour about 150 grams hour about 200 grams hour about 300 grams hour about 400 grams hour about 500 grams hour about 600 grams hour or any value therebetween. In some embodiments the regulated delivery of metal powder maintains relatively constant conditions within the reactor and reduces potential disruptions to the plasma to thereby produce metal oxide nanostructures have relatively uniform characteristics.

In one embodiment wherein a portion of the metal powder delivered to the dielectric tube does not react to form metal oxide nanostructures the method of the present invention further includes separating nanostructures from a stream of nanostructures and unreacted metal powder. Examples of suitable apparatus for separating nanostructures from a stream of nanostructures and unreacted metal powder are described supra.

In one embodiment of the invention wherein a portion of the metal powder delivered to the dielectric tube does not react to form metal oxide nanostructures the method of the present invention further includes recycling unreacted metal powder into the plasma. In some embodiments fresh metal powder feed can be added to the recycled metal powder before feeding the combined stream into the plasma. By recycling unreacted metal powder back to the plasma efficiency of the process can be enhanced waste materials can be reduced continuous production of nanostructures can be achieved and purity of the nanostructure product can be increased.

Examples of suitable apparatus for recycling unreacted metal powder into the plasma are described supra.

In one embodiment a precursor feed can be added to the reaction product stream downstream of the plasma for further reaction. For example a precursor feed can be added downstream of the plasma to promote thin film formation.

In one particular embodiment production of metal oxide nanostructures is conducted at less than about 1000 W of plasma power in an atmosphere of about 5 slpm about 2 slpm argon and about 100 sccm oxygen. Metal powder or granules are allowed to fall under gravity through a plasma jet in a quartz tube the metal granules are melted to form metal oxide nanowires and the metal oxide nanowires are collected from the bottom of the dielectric tube.

In another particular embodiment production of metal oxide nanoparticles is conducted at equal to or greater than about 1000 W of plasma power in an atmosphere of about 5 slpm about 2 slpm argon and about 100 sccm oxygen. Metal powder or granules are allowed to fall under gravity through a plasma jet in a quartz tube the metal granules are vaporized within the plasma to form metal oxide nanoparticles and the metal oxide nanoparticles are collected from the bottom of the dielectric tube.

In one embodiment a method for producing nanostructures further includes delivering a precursor e.g. a metal organic precursor such as a carbon nanotube precursor into the dielectric tube and reacting the precursor within the plasma to form nanostructures. In each instance of the present disclosure a metal containing precursor such as a metal containing organic precursor such as a carbon nanotube precursor can be substituted for the metal powder in a reactor and method to form nanostructures from the precursor. For example in some aspects the present invention includes a method for producing nanostructures comprising delivering a plasma forming gas substantially longitudinally into a dielectric tube delivering a sheath gas into the dielectric tube forming a plasma from the plasma forming gas by applying microwave energy to the plasma forming gas delivering a precursor into the dielectric tube and reacting the precursor within the plasma to form nanostructures. The precursor can include a metal organic precursor such as a carbon nanotube precursor e.g. an iron and hydrocarbon species in a vapor phase feed.

In some embodiments a method for producing metal oxide nanostructures further includes the step of collecting the metal oxide nanostructures. As used herein the term collect collecting and the like refer to recovering nanostructures from a reactor. In certain embodiments collecting refers to recovering formed nanostructures from the dielectric tube a product collector a filter in a product collector a collecting cup or any other portion of the reactor or elements attached thereto. Collection can be achieved by among other things scraping scooping vacuuming or lifting the nanostructures. In one embodiment collecting refers to recovering nanostructures from a filter that is located in a product collector. In one embodiment collecting refers to recovering nanostructures from a filter bag that is configured to hold nanostructures that are gathered by but do not adhere to a filter. For example with reference to in some embodiments the nanostructures can be collected from a filter or a filter bag that is located within a product collector . In some embodiments the nanostructures are collected from two or more locales within the reactor or elements attached to the reactor. For example in some embodiments the nanostructures can be collected from both the product collector and the dielectric tube.

In some embodiments of the present invention the nanostructures themselves can differ in structure depending on the manner and location in which they are collected. For example as shown in and respectively the structure of the nanostructures can differ depending on whether the nanostructures are collected from a dielectric tube from a filter or from a collecting cup.

In some embodiments nanostructures collected from a filter have higher aspect ratios than nanostructures collected from other parts of a reactor. For example in some embodiments metal powder e.g. microparticles having a diameter of about 1 m to about 45 m can be delivered by a regulated metal powder delivery system to the dielectric tube of a reactor and exposed to a plasma having a power of about 1 kW to about 2 kW an Oflow rate of 2.5 lpm and an Nflow rate of about 12.5 lpm to produce nanostructures that can be collected from a filter located in the product collector and have a diameter of about 15 nm to about 30 nm and a length of about 100 m as compared to nanostructures that can be collected from the dielectric tube or other parts of the reactor and have a diameter of about 20 nm to about 100 nm and a length of about 1 m to about 10 m.

In one aspect the method for producing nanostructures further includes depositing nanostructures in a thin film or in an array onto a suitable substrate for example using downstream plasma oxidation of metal film coated substrates or metal substrates.

The methods and apparatus described herein can be used in both batch and continuous processes for the production of nanostructures. In one embodiment nanostructures are deposited on the sides of a dielectric tube and after operation of the reactor for a period of time the nanostructures are recovered from the sides of the dielectric tube. In other embodiments nanostructures are continuously collected from the reactor during its operation.

The methods for producing nanowires described herein can be performed individually in parallel with other nanostructure production processes or in series with other nanostructure production processes. For example in one embodiment the products from one nanostructure production process can be fed to another nanostructure production process to form a continuous production route.

The reactor and methods of the present invention can be used to produce highly pure nanostructure products. In some embodiments the nanostructure products do not contain any foreign material contamination such as for example catalyst substrate or template materials. In particular embodiments the nanostructure products contain less than about 5 less than about 1 less than about 0.5 less than about 0.1 less than about 0.01 or less than about 0.001 by weight foreign material contamination. For example the nanostructure products can contain at least about 99 at least about 99.9 at least about 99.99 or at least about 99.999 metal oxide by weight. In some preferred embodiments highly pure nanostructure products are produced without additional purification or separation of the nanostructure products exiting the reactor.

The metal oxide nanowires of Examples 1 to 4 and 6 were produced using the reactor illustrated in but without recycling system . The reactor was operated at 1000 watts W in an atmosphere of 5 standard liters per minute slpm air sheath gas fed through sheath gas inlets and and a plasma forming gas of 2 slpm argon and 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute sccm of oxygen fed through metal powder and plasma forming gas delivery system at atmospheric pressure. A metal ignition rod with pointed ends was used to ignite the plasma. The metal powder or the metal containing precursor was supplied to the top of the dielectric tube into a microwave plasma jet. Gases and metals reacted at the center of the dielectric tube near the plasma flame head and simultaneously fell under gravity along the plasma flame length. The plasma flame length was about 10 centimeters in length. The dielectric tube was quartz and had a length of about 75 cm and an inside diameter of about 22 millimeters mm about 25 mm outside diameter . Metal oxide nanowires were collected from the bottom of the dielectric tube. The efficiency of nanowire production was about 80 to 90 using about 100 nanometer nm diameter metal powder or granules but was less than 20 when metal granules with sizes greater than about 10 microns were used.

The about 100 nm metal produced more uniform nanowires and about 90 conversion efficiency. The about 10 micron metal had less conversion efficiency 20 30 and produced less uniform nanowires.

Aluminum metal powder or granules about 3 to about 10 microns Aluminum metal powder spherical 97.5 Catalog No. 41000 from Alfa Aesar were allowed to fall under gravity through the plasma jet in the quartz tube and nanoparticles were collected from the bottom of the tube. In this case the microwave power required to form nanoparticles is greater than that required to form nanowires.

Microwave energy of 1 kW was applied to the oxygen and nitrogen gas to form the plasma.

The reactor further comprised a product collector in communication with the 2 inch dielectric tube. The product collector was cylindrically shaped and was 5 inches in diameter and 10 inches long. The product collector comprised a collecting cup and a filter. The collecting cup was a quartz beaker oriented to hold materials that fell through the dielectric tube e.g. . The filter was a grooved high efficiency particulate air filter. The air filter was wound around a cylindrical wire frame that was 2 inches in diameter and 8 inches long. The filter was situated downstream of the collecting cup and was oriented to point in the direction of air flow. The product collector also comprised a 1.5 inch diameter exhaust tube downstream of the filter.

The zinc metal powder was fed at a rate of 3 g min. Subsequently zinc oxide nanostructures were collected from the dielectric tube the collecting cup and the filter.
