title: Methods, systems, and apparatuses for optimal group key management for secure multicast communication
abstract: Apparatuses, systems, and methods for optimal group key (OGK) management that may achieve non-colluding and/or the storage-communication optimality are disclosed. In some embodiments, a group controller (GC) is responsible for key generation and distribution and the group data are encrypted by a group key. When joining the group, in some embodiments, each group member (GM) is assigned a unique n-bit ID and a set of secrets, in which each bit is one-to-one mapped to a unique secret. Whenever GMs are revoked from the group, in some embodiments, the GC will multicast an encrypted key-update message. Only the remaining GMs may be able to recover the message and update GK as well as their private keys. The disclosed OGK scheme can achieve storage-communication optimality with constant message size and immune to collusion attack and also may outperform existing group key management schemes in terms of communication and storage efficiency.

This invention relates to the multicast transmission and more particularly relates to methods and systems for optimal group key management for secure multicast communication. An Optimal Group Keying OGK scheme is disclosed that achieves both the non colluding and storage communication optimality. In the disclosed OGK a group controller GC is responsible for key generation and distribution to group members GM and the group data are encrypted by a group key GK .

IP multicast is used to distribute data to a group of receivers efficiently. The efficiency can be achieved because a datagram is transmitted once at the source and any packet forwarding link in the network saving the cost of the sender as well as network bandwidth.

Multicast group key distribution schemes have been proposed to secure one to many group data distribution using IP multicast. Existing solutions restrict the group memberships by encrypting the data using a symmetric Group Key GK . One of critical requirements of secure group communication is to ensure only legitimated group members to have the update to date GKs when group members join or leave the group dynamically. This requirement is usually achieved through a group rekeying procedure in which a centralized group controller updates the GKs for all legitimate group members.

Group membership revocation is usually a more difficult situation than group membership addition due to the fact that the number of formations of revoked group members is potentially large and thus the group controller needs to preinstall auxiliary secrets for each group member just for revocation purposes. For example in a case where an arbitrary set of members L are revoked from a group G is considered a rekeying message should be generated and distributed to each of G L remaining members who use their preinstalled auxiliary secrets to decipher the rekeying message. Thus the problem of revoking any arbitrary set of members L can be transformed to solving an exponentially increasing key distribution problem.

To address the scalability issue of the membership revocation in secure group communication rooted tree based key distribution schemes have been proposed. In these schemes illustrated in each member is distributed logN secrets for group management i.e. revocation and addition . It is proved that assigning logN secrets to each member is the information theoretical optimal storage strategy when group size is N.

The rooted tree structure see and is constructed such that each group member is assigned a unique leaf node in the tree. Every node in the tree including leaf and non leaf nodes is assigned a unique auxiliary secret. Each group member is pre distributed a set of auxiliary symmetric secrets or keys that are along the path from the leaf to the root in which the root secret is GK for the entire group. Using rooted tree based solutions an auxiliary secret can be shared among a partition of members and a member can be involved in multiple partitions. Typically the a ary rooted tree based solutions require O logN storage overhead for each member where N is the group size. The rooted tree based multicast group key distribution scheme can be divided into two categories Non Flat Table schemes and Flat Table schemes .

Non Flat Table includes rooted tree based schemes such as One Way Function Trees OFT Logical Key Hierarchy Protocol LKH and Efficient Large Group Key Distribution ELK . One important feature of these schemes is there are adistinct secrets at level d in the key distribution tree as illustrated in . In other words each node is associated with a unique secret. The secrets are not necessarily just pre distributed random symmetric keys. They may be generated using one way hash function or pseudo random number generator. Non Flat Table schemes only improve the efficiency marginally. This is because in these solutions based on the logN pre distributed auxiliary keys each group member can merely decrypt logN encrypted streams as illustrated in .

Flat Table schemes adopt a slightly different construction as illustrated in . In Flat Table schemes each group member is issued a unique binary ID bb. . . bbof length n. In addition to the GK group controller generates 2n auxiliary key encryption keys KEK K i Z b 0 1. A group member with ID bb. . . bbholds KEKs K i Z. The KEKs are organized in the key distribution tree in where each level corresponding to one bit position in a user s ID. Thus at each level in the Flat Table key distribution tree there are exact 2 distinct KEKs which map to a bit position in ID. For example in the member with ID 011 is predistributed K K K. In Flat Table the number of partitions each group member can participate is maximized to 2 1 N 1.

Despite its efficiency Flat Table schemes are vulnerable to collusion attacks since FT solutions simply adopt the symmetric KEKs. For example GMs 001 and 010 can decrypt ciphertexts destined to other GMs e.g. 011 000 by combining their symmetric KEKs. To prevent the collusion attacks CP ABE FT was proposed to implement the FT using CP ABE. However message size of CP ABE FT is linearly growing and thus the communication overhead is actually logN. Also CP ABE FT utilizes a periodic refreshment mechanism to ensure forward secrecy. If the ID of a revoked GM is re assigned to another GM before the refreshment the revoked GM can regain the access to group data and then the group forward secrecy is compromised.

Broadcast Encryption BE was also introduced where a broadcaster encrypts a message for some set of users who are listening to a broadcasting channel and use their private keys to decrypt the message. Compared with traditional one to one encryption schemes BE features superior efficiency. Instead of sending messages encrypted with each individual recipient s public key the broadcast encrypter broadcasts one encrypted message to be decrypted by multiple recipients with their own private keys.

Although existing BE schemes feature small or constant ciphertext the number of public key or private key each user needs to perform encryption or decryption are linear on the max number of non colluding users in the system. In the case where the BE scheme is fully collusion resistant the number of public private key each user needs to store equals to the number of users in the system. For example in the existing BE system with N users each user u is generated a public key PKand a private key SK. To encrypt a message to a set of users S the encrypting method takes input of the set of public keys for all recipients PK u S and output the ciphertext. To decrypt a message the decrypting method takes input of the private key SKof user uand the set of all public keys PK u S to recover original message. OGK supports many to many subgroup communication with O logN storage overhead on GMs.

Methods and systems for Optimal Group Keying OGK that achieves non colluding and or the storage communication optimality are disclosed.

In one embodiment the method manages group key of group members in a multicast system each of the group members having a unique ID. The method may comprise determining a group master key and a group public parameter processing a join request from a new group member and or transmitting an encrypted message to a subset of the group members.

In one embodiment processing a join request from a new group member may comprise assigning an available unique ID to the new group member generating with a processing device a private key for the new group member the new private key based on the group master key and the available unique ID multicasting a random group key to the group members and or communicating the random group key and the private key to the new group member.

In one embodiment transmitting an encrypted message to a subset of the group members may comprise determining a set of bit assignments for the subset of group members based on the unique IDs of the group members in the subset of group members encrypting a message based on the master key the group public parameter and the set of bit assignments for the subset of group members and or multicasting the encrypted message to the group members.

In one embodiment the method further comprises receiving a first join request from a first group member assigning a first unique ID to the first group member generating an initial group key generating a first private key based on the first unique ID and or communicating the first private key and the initial group key to the first group member.

In one embodiment the method further comprises receiving leave request from a leaving subset of group members determining a new group master key and a new group public parameter determining an encrypted private key update factor based on group members not in the leaving subset of group members and or multicasting the encrypted private key update factor to the group members.

In some embodiments of OGK a group controller GC is responsible for key generation and distribution and the group data are encrypted by a GK. When joining the group in some embodiments each group member GM is assigned a unique n bit ID and a set of secrets in which each bit is one to one mapped to a unique secret. Different GMs may share common bits in their IDs however the corresponding secrets are different and they are masked by using distinct random numbers. Thus different GMs cannot collude by combining their secrets that are masked by different random numbers. The set of pre distributed secrets are denoted as the GM s private key. In some embodiments a GM can be elected as a GC.

Whenever GMs are revoked from the group in some embodiments the GC will multicast an encrypted key update message. Only the remaining GMs may be able to recover the message and update GK as well as their private keys. In some embodiments to achieve storage communication optimality tree based construction is used and in order to minimize the number of encrypted key update messages a minimized boolean function is used which is in the form of sum of product expression SOPE that is calculated based on the IDs of remaining GMs. Each remaining GM may combine n pre distributed secrets in its private key to decrypt the updated GK.

The disclosed OGK methods and systems can achieve storage communication optimality with constant message size and immune to collusion attack. The disclosed methods and systems can outperform existing group key management schemes in terms of communication and storage efficiency.

Based on the storage communication optimality in some embodiments the disclosed OGK methods and systems also support dynamic subgroup communication efficiently. In some embodiments OGK methods and systems allow each GM to initialize a secure subgroup communication with any subset of GMs in a many to many communication fashion. Moreover the number of required messages for subgroup setup is minimized.

Given any number of revoked GMs the number of encrypted key update messages is information theoretically minimized to O logN .

Certain units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. A module is a self contained hardware or software component that interacts with a larger system. Alan Freedman The Computer Glossary 268 8th ed. 1998 . A module comprises a machine or machines executable instructions. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also include software defined units or instructions that when executed by a processing machine or device transform data stored on a data storage device from a first state to a second state. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and when executed by the processor achieve the stated data transformation.

In one embodiment the server is configured to determine a group master key and a group public parameter process a join request from a new group member and transmit an encrypted message to a subset of the group members.

In fact persons of ordinary skill in the art may utilize any number of suitable structures capable of executing logical operations according to the described embodiments.

The communication model of OGK is based on multicast. illustrates an embodiment of a multicast scheme having Group Members GM and a Group Controller GC . In some embodiments GC is the same as GC . Through multicast communication GC may be able to communicate to each of the various GMs through network e.g. one to many communication . Furthermore each of the various GMs may be able to selectively communicate with each other as well as the GC e.g. many to many . All GMs belong to a multicast group G u u . . . u. Each GM u may be able to send or receive data. The multicast group is associated with a trusted server referred as GC responsible for managing the membership. Each GM can initialize a secure subgroup communication with any subset of GMs. The subgroup traffic is multicasted to whole group while only a designated subset of GMs can decrypt the data.

Pairing is a bilinear map function e G G G where G Gand Gare three cyclic groups with large prime order p. The Gand Gare additive groups and Gis multiplicative group. The discrete Logarithm Problem on G Gand Gare hard. Pairing has the following properties 

Embodiments of the disclosed methods and systems are configured to be secure and protect from attacks to the security. An attackers goal may be to reveal multicasted data. For example consider the attacking scenarios in the following cases 

2 Breaking Backward Secrecy GMs try to reveal any group data that were transmitted before they joined the group.

3 Breaking Forward Secrecy GMs try to continue reveal the group data that are transmitted after they left the group.

4 Collusion Attacks Multiple GMs combine their pre distributed secrets to decrypt the ciphertext not intended to them. One example of this attack is that when multiple GMs are revoked from the group they try to collude to continue decrypting group data. Another example is that when a secure conference is held among a subgroup of GMs some excluded GMs try to listen to the conference.

In the disclosed OGK methods and systems each GM may be associated with a unique binary ID bb. . . bb where n logN. The ID may be issued by the GC when a GM joins the group. Once the GM left the group his her ID may be re assigned to other joining GMs.

A logic literal which is called bit assignment Bor can be used to indicate the binary value at position i in a particular ID. Bindicates the b 1 indicates the b 0. For a group with N GMs the length of an ID is n logN and the total number of bit assignments is 2n that is two binary values are mapped to one bit position. The set of all possible bit assignments is called to be Universe U which contains 2n bit assignments.

In some embodiments a GM u can be uniquely identified by the set of bit assignments Sassociated with u s ID. Also multiple GMs may have a common subset of bit assignments. For example in a GM u s ID is 000 and a GM u s ID is 001 S and S and S S .

In the disclosed OGK methods and systems the GMs can be organized as leafs in a binary tree with each non root node marked with a bit assignment . Note that there are only 2n distinct non root nodes in the tree and each level contains 2 distinct nodes which is different from existing tree based schemes OFT LKH and ELK where there are 2distinct nodes at level d. The ID of a GM can be represented by the bit assignment nodes from the root down to the leaf. Thus any two GMs will have at least one different bit assignment.

The schematic flow chart diagrams that follow are generally set forth as logical flow chart diagrams. As such the depicted order and labeled steps are indicative of one embodiment of the presented method. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function logic or effect to one or more steps or portions thereof of the illustrated method. Additionally the format and symbols employed are provided to explain the logical steps of the method and are understood not to limit the scope of the method. Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flow chart diagrams they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding method. Indeed some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the method. For instance an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted method. Additionally the order in which a particular method occurs may or may not strictly adhere to the order of the corresponding steps shown.

In some embodiments the method may be configured to receive joint requests now shown a first group member. This may include receiving a first join request from a first group member assigning a first unique ID to the first group member generating an initial group key and generating a first private key based on the first unique ID and or communicating the first private key and the initial group key to the first group member.

In some embodiments the method may also be configured to receive leave requests for one or more group members. This process may include receiving leave request from a leaving subset of group members determining a new group master key and a new group public parameter determining an encrypted private key update factor based on group members not in the leaving subset of group members and multicasting the encrypted private key update factor to the group members.

As discussed with regard to a multicast system has a GC in addition to one or more group members. In some embodiments the group members may also have a server configured to perform one or more method steps sometimes referred to as the group member server. In some embodiments a group member may be configured to join a group. In some embodiments joining a group may include transmitting a join request to the GC and receiving a private key and a group key from the GC. Additionally the group members may be configured to receive an encrypted message. Receiving an encrypted message may include determining encryption eligibility and decrypting the encrypted message based on the private key.

In some embodiments a group member may also be configured to receive an updated group key in response to the new group member joining from the GC.

In some embodiments the group member may be configured to transmit a leave request to the GC and in a particular embodiment the group member maybe configured to receive an encrypted private key update factor and update the private key based on the encrypted private key update factor.

Specific embodiments of the method steps may be performed by the modules and methods steps discussed with regards to . illustrates one embodiment of an apparatus for optimal group key management. generally illustrates an embodiment of the GC server. In various embodiments the GMs may have a processing device e.g. a mobile processor . The GM processing device may be less robust than the embodiment of the GC server illustrated in . However specific embodiments of the GM server may be configured to perform specific methods discussed with regards to the modules of . For example in some embodiments the GM may be configured able to initiate a group communication to a subgroup of other GMs without the use of the GC server.

In one embodiment the apparatus is a server sometimes referred to as the GC server configured to load and operate software modules configured for optimal group key management. Alternatively the apparatus may include hardware modules configured with analog or digital logic firmware executing FPGAs or the like configured to generate method steps of method . In such embodiments the apparatus may include a group initialization module GM joining key generation module encryption decryption modules and GM leaving module .

Specific embodiments of how the GC may setup the multicast group are disclosed. In some embodiments first GC chooses bilinear map over group G Gand Gof prime order p. Assume the generator of Gis g and generator of Gis h. Also GC chooses a publicly known one way function H. Then it chooses two non trivial random numbers Z . For simplicity the universe of bit assignments U is mapped to the first U members of Z i.e. the integers 1 2 . . . U . For each bit assignment B U GC chooses a non trivial random number y Z. This set of 2n random numbers are denoted as 

When a new GM u joins the group in some embodiments u needs to setup a secure channel with the GC using either a pre shared key or public key certificates. GC may then check whether the GM is authorized to join. Once the checking is passed GC may assign a unique ID bb. . . band a set of bit assignments Sto u.

In some embodiments once u is admitted to the group GC may run key generation method KeyGen MK S to generate private key SKfor u where MK is the group master key and Sis the set of bit assignments in u ID. The method may first choose a non trivial random number r Z . Then it may compute

If u is the first GM in the group GC in some embodiments may generate an initial GK and send the private key SK GK to the new GM u through a secure channel. If u is not the first joining GM to preserve backward secrecy GC may generate another random key GK and multicast GK . Each GM other than u can decrypt the message and replace GK with GK . Finally GC may send SK GK to the new GM u through a secure unicast channel. In embodiments of the join process besides the unicast communication GC only needs to multicast one message i.e. GK . Thus the communication overhead for GMs join is O 1 .

One observation is that GC in a preferred embodiment does not need to store the ID or private keys of any GMs. Thus the storage overhead of GC can be significantly reduced to O logN since GC is only required to store the system parameters and master key.

As has been mentioned OGK allows GC and GMs to securely communicate with any subset of GMs. Whenever GMs are revoked from the group GC needs to multicast a key update message to all remaining GMs who will update their GK as well as private keys. On the other hand GMs can initialize a secure subgroup communications with any subset of GMs.

Embodiments of how a GC or GM can encrypt a message with a set of bit assignment S are disclosed so that only GMs whose IDs satisfy S can decrypt the message. For example in a three bit ID group if a ciphertext is encrypted by using bit assignment S B GMs with IDs 010 and 011 can decrypt the ciphertext.

Encrypt GP S M encryption method in specific embodiments takes inputs of the group parameter GP a set of bit assignment S the message M and returns the ciphertext CT. In a specific embodiment given the set of bit assignment S it is easy to calculate the following terms 

After calculating e g h and g the Encrypt method in a specific embodiment generates a non trivial random number t Z . Then the method computes C M e g h C g C g where is bitwise XOR operation. Thus the ciphertext is as CT 

On receiving the CT those GMs who satisfy the bit assignment CT.S can decrypt the CT by performing decryption method Decrypt GP SK CT .

The Decrypt method in a specific embodiment may first check whether the GM u is eligible to decrypt the message by testing whether CT.SS where CT.S represents the bit assignments associated with the ciphertext CT. Then for each bit assignment B CT.S the method use u s pre distributed secret shares D hto compute 

Various embodiments of how GC or GMs can securely communicate with arbitrary subgroup of members optimally are presented. Some of the terms used in the following are defined as follows 

Given a subgroup of GMs L a boolean membership function M B B . . . B B which is in the form of SOPE is used to determine the membership of this subgroup. Formally the following properties of membership functions hold 

In some embodiments the GC or a GM runs the Quine McCluskey algorithm to reduce Mto minimal SOPE M. One having skill in the art will recognize other algorithms to reduce Mto minimal SOPE M. The reduction can consider do not care values on those IDs that are not currently assigned to any GM to further reduce the size of M. Since Mis in the form of SOPE encryption is performed on each product term. That is for each product term E in M Encrypt method encrypts the message with the set of bit assignment S that contains all literals in E. The total number of encrypted message equals to the number of product terms in M.

For example if L 000 001 011 111 M BB. It can be found that Mcontains 2 product terms. The message M for the subgroup L can be encrypted as M and M respectively.

In some embodiments when several GMs denoted by set L are revoked from the group GC needs to update the MK GP GK as well as the private key of each remaining GM u G L. Various embodiments are disclosed to show how this process can be done efficiently.

In some embodiments the GC may first change MK to MK Y where is randomly selected in Z. Also group public parameter GP is updated accordingly. Then GC may multicast an encrypted key update factor

In one embodiment only one GM leaves the group. For example if the leaving GM u s ID is 101 with bit assignment S B B the key updating message may be encrypted as kuf kuf kuf and may be multicased to the entire group. If ID 100 is not assigned kuf may not needed. Although the leaving member may intercept the transmitted messages it cannot decrypt them since every message is encrypted with a bit assignment that the leaving member does not possess. On the other hand each of remaining GMs can decrypt at least one of the multicasted messages.

In certain embodiments multiple GMs leave the multicast group. Given the set of leaving GMs L GC can easily derive the set of remaining GMs i.e. G L as well as the set of unassigned IDs if GC stores all assigned IDs. If GC does not store assigned ID GC can assume all IDs are assigned. Then the GC may run the Quine McCluskey algorithm or other like algorithm to reduce the membership function Mto minimal SOPE. Then GC may encrypt the key updating factor for each product term. The total number of encrypted key updating factors equals to the number of product terms in M. For example it is assumed that two GMs 000 010 leave five GMS 001 011 100 101 110 remain and 111 is not assigned to any GM i.e. the ID bit assignments are do not care . With the considerations do not care values M can be reduced to M B B. GC need to multicast two messages kuf and kuf.

Practical issues in implementing OGK are disclosed including choice of parameters optimization methods on further reducing ciphertext size. The disclosed OGK toolkit is implemented as a set of tools and a core library which has been made available on the web under the GPL. The disclosed implementation uses the Pairing Based Cryptography PBC library.

OGK is implemented over two parameter sets each of which is specially optimized for different purposes. The Type A curve is a on supersingular curve y x x over 512 bit finite field which defines a 160 bit elliptic curve group and features fastest pairing computation. On the other hand the Type D curve is chosen using MNT method and has shortest group elements. Note that each element can be compressed to reduce size. In the actual implementation and performance evaluation the compressed Type D element was adopted to minimize storage and communication overhead. The benchmark was performed on a modern workstation which has a 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 cpu with 2 MB cache and 1.5 GB memory and runs Linux 2.6.32 kernel. The Type A and Type D parameters are compared in Table 2.

Total multicast data size can be reduced by combining common Ccomponents for different product terms in the same membership function. For example if L 000 001 011 111 M BB. It can be found that Mcontains 2 product terms. The message M for L can be encrypted as M and M. As presented in this disclosure the 2 encrypted messages are constructed as

The performance of OGK scheme is analyzed and compared with several related solutions Flat Table scheme FT FT implemented using CP ABE FT ABE Subset Diff broadcast encryption scheme BGW broadcasting encryption and Non Flat Table tree based schemes e.g. OFT LKH ELK etc. . The performance is assessed in terms of communication overhead number and size of messages incurred by join and leave operations storage overhead group data stored on the GC and GM and computation overhead number of cryptographic operations needed in encryption and decryption operations . The group size is denoted as N the number of leaving GMs as l. Also for the Subset Diff scheme t denotes the maximum number of colluding users to compromise the ciphertext. The summary of comparative results is presented in Table 3.
