This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 334 968 filed Dec. 15 2008 which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to provisioning organizational definitions and more particularly to provisioning organizational definitions in a unified messaging platform environment.

Unified messaging is the integration of multiple typically two or more types of communication e.g. email voicemail short message service SMS fax etc. into a single unified message store e.g. a unified messaging platform accessible from a variety of user devices. Unified messaging is typically provided by a service provider which may be the same service provider that provides telephone service. In order for a service provider to provide unified messaging service to an organization of subscribers also called users which may be employees of a client organization the unified messaging platform must be configured with organizational data regarding related groups in the client organization s organizational structure. Each client can be assigned his her own unified messaging mailbox.

Conventionally provisioning of business groups of a subscriber into the unified messaging platform is done manually using interactive software. Such software allows a client or the service provider to manually define organizational structures for the client organization in order to define mailboxes for individual users and to maintain group hierarchies in the client s organizational structure. Although this approach is effective it requires the manual definitions of a client s organizations and groups into organizational data supported by the unified messaging platform. This can be tedious and error prone. Furthermore manually defining such organizational data can take a long time and be operationally expensive particularly for larger businesses and organizations.

Accordingly automatic definition of organizational data in a unified messaging platform is desirable.

The present invention provides a method and system for automatically defining organizational data in a unified messaging platform environment.

In one embodiment of the present invention an adapter in a unified messaging platform connects to at least one client human resources or equivalent database. Human resources information that is organized in an organizational hierarchy is retrieved from the human resources database and hierarchical organizational data is automatically generated in the UM platform based on the organizational hierarchy of the human resources information retrieved from the human resources database.

These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to an enhanced unified messaging UM system in which organization data corresponding to an organizational hierarchy of a client is automatically provisioned.

The adapter retrieves the organizational hierarchy from the human resources database and creates corresponding organizational data in the UM platform . For example the adapter can create Intermediate Logic Nodes ILNs and Communities of Interest COIs corresponding to the organizational hierarchy of the human resources information stored in the human resources database . In the UM platform a COI is group that shares one or more common attributes. For example a group of employees located at a particular geographical branch of a business or a group of employees who report to the same supervisor can be grouped into a COI. An ILN is an organizational designation for which there are one or more COIs. For example an ILN of location can have multiple COIs each COI corresponding to a particular geographical branch of a business. As another example an ILN may be used to represent a branch location and the COIs that are under that ILN may represent various departments in that location. It is to be understood that the organizational structure of a particular organization or business can be organized according to various ILNs and COIs. An advantage of the UM system of is that the adapter automatically reflects the organizational structure of information stored in the human resources database in the ILNs and COIs created for the UM platform .

The adapter can be implemented as a processor or controller executing software instructions for defining the organizational data. The adapter can communicate with the UM platform using a UM application programming interface API . According to an advantageous embodiment the adapter can communicate with the UM platform using a previously existing API used for defining organizational data. Accordingly the adapter can be seamlessly integrated into UM platforms already in use. The adapter can communicate with the human resources database using an API e.g. abstracted LDAP or SQL based associated with the human resources database . According to a possible implementation the adapter can be pre designed to interface with the most common types of human resources databases such as SAP PeopleSoft Intuit Payroll solutions etc. According to another possible implementation the adapter may be custom designed for any other types of human resources database used by a particular client.

The UM platform includes multiple UM mailboxes located at one or more messaging centers MCs . The UM interface includes one or more server or server like devices that can be implemented as computers such as the computer discussed below with respect to . The MCs can be provided at various geographic locations. Each user of the UM platform is assigned a mailbox. Mailboxes assigned to users grouped within a COI are assigned to the same MC. The UM platform may be coupled to or include the adapter and or a UM database . The UM platform stores the organizational data such as the ILNs and the COIs created by the UM adapter into the UM database . The UM database and service provider database may be combined and be part of one database and may also be integrated with the UM platform .

When the adapter derives the organizational data for the UM platform corresponding to the human resources information in the human resources database the UM platform may automatically provision a mailbox for each user specified in the human resources information. The UM platform assigns mailboxes associated with the users to MCs based on the COIs associated with the users so that the UM mailboxes for all users associated with a COI are assigned to the same MC. In addition to the human resources information retrieved from the human resources database the UM platform can be provided with additional data from a service provider database to influence the assignment of the COIs to various MCs. The service provider database can be coupled to or included in the UM platform or can he maintained by a service provider separately from the UM platform . The service provider database can include information such as geographical locations of users local access and transport area LATA definitions call forwarding number CFN definitions capacity constraints of existing UM MCs etc. The UM platform can utilize this information when assigning mailboxes of users associated with a COI to an MC.

Placements of logical organizational units e.g. COIs at MCs can be adjusted at any time. Illustratively the following parameters can be provided by the UM platform for automatic provisioning 1 NPA NNX tuple and the target MC name for mapping COIs to specific MCs. The mapping of the target MCs may be automatically conditioned on the capacity of available MCs whereby a list of MCs is provided to overcome remaining capacity limitations 2 CFN to MC mappings and 3 Class of Service COS identification. It is to be understood that these parameters are exemplary and other parameters may be provided as well.

The system of can be implemented as a turn key operation with existing UM platforms to achieve virtually instantaneous group definitions and virtually no errors. Furthermore the service provider can access the adaptor and or UM platform in order to fine tune changes or modify group definitions. Programming and or user interface access may also be given to the customer so that the customer can also modify or customize the group definitions.

At step if there is no user associated with the HR entry an ILN corresponding to the entry is generated. If there is no user associated with the entry the entry represents an organizational entity not an individual. An ILN representing the entity is generated and the name is used as the name of the ILN in the UM platform. The ILN may be created in all of the MCs of the UM platform without any associated mailboxes as metadata since mailboxes are associated with COIs . After the ILN is generated the method proceeds to the next HR entry.

At step if there is a user associated with the HR entry the user the HR entry may be associated with a COI node. In particular if a COI node does not yet exist for this organizational level the COI node is created. Other users at the same organizational level may then be assigned to this COI node. If the appropriate COI node already exists the user may be associated with the existing COI node.

At step a target MC is determined for a user mailbox. At step a mailbox may be created for the user at the determined MC. A configured UM input parameter can be used to assign he mailbox to a given MC. For example the UM platform may provide the following data to adapter NPA NNX MC name LATA. Accordingly based on the NPA and NNX of the TN associated with the user the adapter assigns the user to a particular MC and LATA. If a capacity constraint of a configured MC is above a certain threshold a list of other MCs in the LATA can be provided by the UM platform and another configured MC can be used. This fact and the result of the operation are communicated to the UM platform. The MC name of the MC to which the mailbox is assigned can be used to drive the Call Forwarding Number CFN information for that MC. Accordingly a CFN associated with the mailbox can be determined based on the assigned MC. The mailbox can be created for the user with the primary contact number of the user as the key to the mailbox creation i.e. resulting in a Web Services API call createMailbox TN CFA LATA COS . . . . The user s name is mapped to the subscriber of that mailbox. Alternate device information may be optionally incorporated into the mailbox definition e.g. for UM FMFM service .

As described above the method of generates and provisions organizational data in the UM platform corresponding to an HR entry. The method is repeated for all HR entries in the HR database. Accordingly the graph e.g. tree of HR entries are automatically mapped into ILN and COI nodes in the UM platform by the adapter using predefined mappings provided by the UM platform. These template production rules can be customized for each organization. Schemas of HR databases are generally unique to each vendor and maybe different for each business. Hence column names for example may be unique for each business customer while particular column names may or may not be the same as other customers of the same database vendor.

The above described methods for defining and provisioning organizational data in a UM platform can be implemented on a computer using well known computer processors memory units storage devices computer software and other components. A high level block diagram of such a computer is illustrated in . Computer contains a processor which controls the overall operation of the computer by executing computer program instructions which define such operation. The computer program instructions may be stored in a storage device or other computer readable medium e.g. magnetic disk CD ROM etc. and loaded into memory when execution of the computer program instructions is desired. Thus the method steps of can be defined by the computer program instructions stored in the memory and or storage and controlled by the processor executing the computer program instructions. For example the computer program instructions can be implemented as computer executable code programmed by one skilled in the art to perform an algorithm defined by the method steps of . Accordingly by executing the computer program instructions the processor executes an algorithm defined by the method steps of . The computer also includes one or more network interfaces for communicating with other devices via a network. The computer also includes input output devices that enable user interaction with the computer e.g. display keyboard mouse speakers buttons etc. One skilled in the art will recognize that an implementation of an actual computer could contain other components as well and that is a high level representation of some of the components of such a computer for illustrative purposes.
