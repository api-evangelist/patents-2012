This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 558 670 filed Nov. 11 2011.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use OFDM modulation for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of evolved universal terrestrial radio access network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and radio network controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node or eNodeB to the wireless device or UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node. Furthermore the nodes can be connected to a mobility management entity MME located in the core network by means of the S1 interface.

Another technology for mobile communication is a universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS which is a 3GPP mobile cellular technology for networks using code division multiple access CDMA . In UMTS the node can be a combination of Node Bs also commonly denoted as NodeBs or NBs and radio network controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as the UE. UMTS can specify a network system covering the UMTS terrestrial radio access network UTRAN a core network including a mobile application part MAP and an authentication of users via subscriber identity module SIM cards. The RNCs can be connected to the core network by means of the Iu interface.

Under certain circumstances known as access barring a node can prevent or restrict wireless device users from making access attempts which can include emergency call attempts or responding to pages in specified areas of a public land mobile network PLMN . Such situations can include states of emergency or failure of one or more co located PLMNs. Access class barring ACB can be used to prevent wireless devices from making access attempts to the node in LTE systems and UMTS.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A large number of machine type communication MTC devices and or machine to machine M2M devices may access a radio access network RAN . As used herein MTC and M2M may be used interchangeably. The MTC devices may overload the RAN and a core network CN supporting the RAN. Overload control and protection mechanisms may be provided in a network to reduce overload conditions due to a large number of MTC devices that the RAN and core network may support.

Access barring such as extended access barring EAB can provide overload control and protection of the network including the RAN and the CN. Access barring can allow the network to bar the access of low priority and or delay tolerant MTC devices or services when the network e.g. the RAN or the core network and or a network component e.g. a node is overloaded. As used herein delay tolerant and low priority may be used interchangeably. Access barring such as access class barring ACB and extended access barring EAB allows a node to broadcast messages which can prevent or restrict wireless device users from making access attempts at the node. Broadcast messages can be available on a cell by cell basis indicating the class es or categories of subscribers barred from network access. Access barring allows a network operator to prevent overload of the radio access network and core network.

In an example wireless devices can be members of one out of ten randomly allocated mobile populations defined as access classes 0 to 9. A population number can be stored in a subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module SIM or universal subscriber identity module USIM . In addition wireless devices may be members of one or more special categories e.g. access classes 11 to 15 also held in the SIM USIM. The special categories can be allocated to specific high priority users. Class 15 can be allocated to public land mobile networks PLMNs staff class 14 can be allocated to emergency services class 13 can be allocated to public utilities e.g. water gas suppliers class 12 can be allocated to security services and class 11 can be allocated for PLMN use.

In ACB if the wireless device is a member of at least one access class AC which corresponds to permitted classes as signaled over an air interface and the access class is applicable in the serving network access attempts may be allowed. Classes 0 9 can be allowed in home public land mobile networks PLMNs and visited PLMNs VPLMNs . Classes 11 and 15 can be allowed in a home PLMN HPLMN if an equivalent home PLMN EHPLMN list is not present or any EHPLMN. Classes 12 13 or 14 can be allowed in the HPLMN and VPLMNs of a home country. A home country can be the country of the mobile country code MCC part of the international mobile subscriber identity IMSI . Any number of these classes may be barred at any one time.

EAB can provide additional access barring over ACB. Extended access barring EAB can include a mechanism for the operator s e.g. network operators to control mobile originating access attempts from wireless devices configured for EAB in order to prevent overload of the access network and or the core network. In congestion situations the operator can restrict access from wireless devices configured for EAB while permitting access from other wireless devices. Wireless devices configured for EAB can be considered more tolerant to access restrictions than other wireless devices. The network can broadcast information to provide EAB control for wireless devices in a specific area when an operator or some automated process determines to apply EAB such as an overload condition or other triggering event.

A wireless device configured for EAB can be categorized based on the wireless device s roaming category a wireless device s relationship to the PLMN which supports a node . The node in the RAN of the PLMN can use a broadcast control channel BCCH to broadcast EAB information to wireless devices. The EAB information on the BCCH can indicate which category of wireless devices configured with EAB can apply EAB. Access barring information e.g. the EAB information can be transmitted in the BCCH using a system information block SIB or a master information block MIB . Wireless devices configured with EAB can check their categories e.g. category A B or C discussed below in order to determine whether or not to apply EAB. In an example two bits can be used to indicate the roaming category on which EAB parameters are applied to the wireless device.

EAB can bar different types or categories of wireless devices than ACB and or EAB can provide different barring mechanisms than ACB. EAB may be configured for delay tolerant access wireless devices such as MTC wireless devices instead of all wireless devices in ACB. Wireless devices configured for EAB can be more tolerant to access restrictions e.g. delay tolerant than other wireless devices. EAB can be used to handle roamers or wireless devices operating outside a HPLMN and or EHPLMN. For a wireless device configured with EAB EAB may take precedence over ACB.

In an example the EAB parameters can include a barring bitmap where each bit corresponds to an access class AC . A total of 10 bits can be used for AC . For example when a particular bit in the barring bitmap is set to 1 e.g. a logical or digital one or a set flag the corresponding AC can be barred. Otherwise the particular bit in the barring bitmap is set to 0 e.g. a logical or digital zero or a non set flag the corresponding AC may not be barred.

MTC devices can be numerous in a cell or the RAN. With MTC usage a large number of MTC wireless devices can have bursty access to the node which can overload the node and or the network. In an overload condition the random access channel RACH may be overloaded which may block access of a normal priority wireless device non delay tolerant access wireless device non low priority access wireless device or high priority wireless device for a substantial period of time. Normal priority wireless devices can have blocked access because other wireless devices transmissions may interfere with the node s reception of normal priority wireless devices RACH so the node cannot decode the transmission. EAB can be employed to block or bar a random access procedure from being performed on wireless devices configured for EAB or EAB can be employed to block or bar a transmission on the RACH by wireless devices configured for EAB. As a result EAB can reduce the overload on the RACH.

When the access e.g. radio resource control RRC connection establishment of a particular AC is barred pending requests and traffic of a large number of wireless devices e.g. MTC devices and UEs with that AC can continue to build up. At the time the network e.g. node releases the barring of that AC i.e. by setting the corresponding bit in the barring bitmap to 0 a large number of wireless devices with pending uplink UL traffic can start to perform random access RA procedure by transmitting on the RACH. The substantially concurrent transmission on the RACH by the wireless devices of the AC released from the EAB bar can generate a high collision rate on the RACH which can cause RA failure.

In an example a random backoff timer or a backoff indicator can be used as a mechanism to distribute the RA requests of wireless devices of a particular class when the access barring of that class is changed from barred to not barred . With the random backoff timer or the backoff indicator the collision rate on the RACH can be reduced significantly. The random backoff timer or the backoff indicator can apply to both a LTE RAN and an UMTS RAN.

In an example a node can authorize wireless devices to access the node using EAB. The wireless devices can receive EAB configuration information in a BCCH from the node. The EAB configuration information can bar specified wireless devices configured for EAB.

The EAB configuration information can include an EAB barring category also referred to as a roaming category. In an example EAB barring categories can use a two bit field for category A B or C. For example 00 can correspond to category A wireless devices 01 can correspond to category B wireless devices and 10 can correspond to category C wireless devices.

In an example category A can indicate wireless devices that are configured for EAB. Category B can indicate wireless devices that are configured for EAB and are neither in the wireless device s HPLMN nor in a PLMN equivalent to the wireless device s HPLMN EHPLMN . Category C can indicate wireless devices that are configured for EAB and are neither in the PLMN listed as most preferred PLMN of the country where the wireless device is roaming in an operator defined PLMN selector list on the SIM USIM nor in the wireless device s HPLMN nor in a PLMN that is equivalent to the wireless device s HPLMN.

A public land mobile network PLMN can include a network established and operated by a regulatory body an administration or a recognized private operating agency RPOA for a specific purpose of providing land mobile communication services to the public. A relationship can exist between each subscriber and the subscriber s home PLMN HPLMN . If communications are handled over to another PLMN the other PLMN can be referred to as a visited PLMN VPLMN . A PLMN may provide service in one or a combination of frequency bands. A PLMN can be defined by borders of a country. More than one PLMN can exist in a country. The PLMN area can be the geographical area in which a PLMN provides communication services.

In an example the three categories can be mutually exclusive where wireless devices in category A are not in category B or category C and wireless devices in category B are not in category A or category C and wireless devices in category C are not in category A or category B.

In another example e.g. each subcategory can be a superset of another category. For example category A can be a superset of category B and category B can be a superset of category C which can mean EAB applicable to category A wireless devices can apply to categories B and C wireless devices. Stated another way category C can be a subset of category B and category B can be a subset of category A which can mean EAB applicable to category B wireless devices can apply to categories C wireless devices but may not apply to category A wireless devices.

The following provides additional details of the examples. illustrates a flow chart of applying a random backoff before performing random access RA for wireless devices that have pending radio resource control RRC connection establishment request and access is not barred in the updated extended access barring EAB information for the wireless devices.

When a wireless device e.g. UE which has pending RRC connection establishment request receives EAB information that lifts the access barring for the wireless device the wireless device can first perform a random backoff delay before starting a RA procedure. The random backoff delay can prevent a large number of wireless devices that have pending RRC connection establishment request to cluster their RACH transmissions within a short time frame right after the EAB access barring is lifted which can reduce a probability for a physical random access channel PRACH preamble collision. For a wireless device that does not have pending RRC connection establishment request a random backoff delay may not be applied. When the wireless device without a pending RRC connection establishment request initiates a RRC connection establishment request and access is not barred the wireless device can start the RA procedure without any random backoff delay.

Referring to the wireless device configured with EAB can receive EAB information broadcast from the network e.g. the node . The wireless device can determine if EAB information has been previously stored in the wireless device . If EAB information has not been previously stored in the wireless device the wireless device can store the received EAB information . If previously received EAB information has been stored in the wireless device the wireless device can replace the existing stored EAB information with the current EAB information received. From the EAB information the wireless device can determine if access is barred by EAB . If the received EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for an RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. In one embodiment the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred. In another embodiment the RRC connection establishment request from the upper layers can be pending or queued at an access stratum AS . The upper layers can include the media access control MAC or the radio resource control RRC layers. A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system communication layers can include the physical PHY media access control MAC radio link control RLC packet data convergence protocol PDCP and radio resource control RRC layers. If the received EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device can wait until updated EAB information releases the EAB for the EAB class associated with the wireless device e.g. unbarring the wireless access for the associated EAB class .

If the received EAB information indicates that the access is not barred the wireless device can determine if the wireless device has a pending RRC connection establishment request from the upper layers. If the wireless device has pending RRC connection establishment request from the upper layers the wireless device can apply a random backoff delay e.g. count a random backoff time before performing PRACH preamble transmission . In an example the random backoff time can be calculated according to a uniform distribution between 0 and a maximum backoff time period e.g. a max backoff EAB value where the max backoff EAB can be a maximum possible value for the random backoff time . The wireless device can set a random backoff timer e.g. Tbarring EAB to the calculated random backoff time. In an embodiment the maximum backoff time period can be configured by the node e.g. NB or eNB via broadcast or unicast RRC signaling. In an example option the wireless device may start the RA procedure including the PRACH preamble transmission after the expiry e.g. expiration of the random backoff timer. In another example option the wireless device may check to the EAB information to determine if access is still not barred after the expiry e.g. expiration of the random backoff timer and before starting the RA procedure. In an embodiment when access is barred prior to the expiry of random backoff timer the RRC connection establishment request from upper layers is pending or queued at the access stratum. In another embodiment after the wireless device calculates the random backoff time the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred and can provide a value of random backoff time to the upper layers. The upper layers may request establishment of an RRC connection after random backoff time has elapsed.

When the upper layers request an establishment of an RRC connection while the wireless device is in an RRC IDLE mode the wireless device can check for the stored EAB information . If the stored EAB information is present and the stored EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. In one embodiment the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred . In another embodiment the RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum. If no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred the wireless device can perform random access procedure i.e. without a backoff delay for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. For example the wireless device can perform a PRACH preamble transmission after receiving the RRC connection establishment request when no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred.

Referring to the wireless device configured with EAB can receive EAB information broadcast from the network e.g. eNB or NB . The wireless device can determine if EAB information has been previously stored in the wireless device . If EAB information has not been previously stored in the wireless device the wireless device can store the received EAB information . If previously received EAB information has been stored in the wireless device the wireless device can replace the existing stored EAB information with the current EAB information received. From the EAB information the wireless device can determine if access is barred by EAB . If the received EAB information indicates that the access is not barred the wireless device can apply a random backoff delay e.g. count a random backoff time before performing RACH transmission. If the random backoff timer e.g. Tbarring EAB is disabled the wireless device can start the random backoff timer and can set the value to a random backoff time calculated according to a uniform distribution between 0 and a maximum backoff time period e.g. a max backoff EAB value where the max backoff EAB can be a maximum possible value for the random backoff time . In an embodiment the maximum backoff time period can be configured by the node e.g. NB or eNB via broadcast or unicast RRC signaling. In an embodiment after the wireless device calculates the random backoff time the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred and can provide a random backoff time to the upper layers. The upper layers may request establishment of an RRC connection after the random backoff time has elapsed. In another embodiment the wireless device does not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum.

If the received EAB information indicates that the access to the node is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for an RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. In an embodiment if the random backoff timer e.g. Tbarring EAB is running the wireless device can stop and disable the random backoff timer. In another embodiment the wireless device may not stop or disable the random backoff timer. In an embodiment the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred. In another embodiment the wireless device may not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum.

When the upper layers request an establishment of an RRC connection while the wireless device is in an RRC IDLE mode the wireless device can check for the stored EAB information . In an embodiment if the stored EAB information is present and the stored EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. In another embodiment if the random backoff timer e.g. Tbarring EAB is running the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. Otherwise if the random backoff timer is enabled but has expired wireless device can perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. For example the wireless device can perform a RACH transmission after receiving the RRC connection establishment request for pending RRC connection establishment requests or subsequent RRC connection establishment request when no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred.

When the wireless device does not perform random access procedure or for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls the wireless device can inform upper layers or that the RRC connection establishment request is barred. In an embodiment the wireless device provides the value of the random backoff timer to the upper layers if the random backoff timer is running. The upper layers may request an establishment of an RRC connection after a time that corresponds to the value of the random backoff timer has elapsed. In another embodiment the wireless device may not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or or queued at the access stratum.

If no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred and the random backoff timer is running the wireless device may not perform the random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. The wireless device can inform upper layers that the RRC connection establishment request is barred. In an embodiment the wireless device can provide the value of the random backoff timer to the upper layers. The upper layers may request an establishment of an RRC connection after a time that corresponds to the value of the random backoff time that has elapsed. In another embodiment the wireless device may not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum.

If no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred and the random backoff timer is not running or has expired option the wireless device can perform random access procedure for a new pending or queued RRC connection establishment request for mobile originating calls. In another example option the wireless device may check to the EAB information to determine if access is still not barred after the expiry e.g. expiration of the random backoff timer and before starting the RA procedure. In an embodiment the wireless device can stop and disable the random backoff timer. In another embodiment the wireless device may not stop or disable the random backoff timer.

The wireless device can generate a RRC connection establishment request from the upper layers. When the upper layers request an establishment of an RRC connection while the wireless device is in RRC IDLE mode the wireless device can check the current EAB information. From the EAB information the wireless device can determine if access is barred by EAB . If the EAB information is present and the EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls.

The wireless device can inform upper layers that the RRC connection establishment request is barred. In another embodiment the wireless device may not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum.

If no EAB information is stored or the EAB information indicates that the access is not barred the wireless device can perform a random backoff e.g. count a random backoff time before performing PRACH preamble transmission. The random backoff time can be calculated according to a uniform distribution between 0 and a maximum backoff time period e.g. a max backoff EAB value where the max backoff EAB can be a maximum possible value for the random backoff time . The wireless device can set a random backoff timer e.g. Tbarring EAB to the calculated random backoff time. In an embodiment the maximum backoff time period can be configured by the node e.g. NB or eNB via broadcast or unicast RRC signaling. In an example option the wireless device can start the RA procedure including the PRACH preamble transmission after the expiry e.g. expiration of the random backoff timer. In another example option the wireless device may check to the EAB information to determine if access is still not barred after the expiry e.g. expiration of the random backoff timer. In an embodiment after the wireless device calculates the random backoff time the wireless device can inform the upper layers that the access is barred and can provide the random backoff time to the upper layers. The upper layers may request establishment of an RRC connection after the random backoff time has elapsed. In another embodiment the wireless device may not inform the upper layers that the access is barred. The RRC connection establishment request from upper layers can be pending or queued at the access stratum.

In a configuration the PRACH resource for the MTC and non MTC wireless devices can be segregated. Because a media access control MAC layer protocol data unit PDU including RAR s can be tied to a PRACH resource by segregating the PRACH resources for MTC and non MTC wireless devices a particular MAC PDU including RAR s may be destined for e.g. received by either MTC wireless devices or non MTC wireless devices. Thus the BI included in a MAC PDU including RAR s may be received either by MTC wireless devices or non MTC wireless devices.

In another configuration the PRACH resource can be substantially the same for the MTC and non MTC wireless devices e.g. the PRACH resource for the MTC and non MTC wireless devices may not be segregated . The MTC and non MTC wireless devices can listen to e.g. receive a substantially same RAR MAC PDU. The MAC PDU header can be modified to allow more than one BI subheader to be included in the MAC PDU header. In an example at least two reserved bits R can be used to identify a MTC specific BI subheader as illustrated in for a E T R R BI MAC header where E represents an extension field T represents a type field R represents a reserved bit field e.g. R and R and BI represents a BI field. The MTC specific BI subheader can be transmitted in octet e.g. 8 bits . In an example the size of each field except for BI can be one bit. For example MTC specific BI subheader field descriptions can include an extension field a type field a reserved bit field and or a BI field. The extension field E can be a flag indicating if more fields are present in the MAC header or not. The E field can be set to 1 to indicate at least another set of E T RAPID or E T R R BI fields follows. The E field can be set to 0 to indicate that a MAC RAR or padding starts at the next byte. The type field T can be a flag indicating whether the MAC subheader contains a random access ID or a backoff indicator. The T field can be set to 0 to indicate the presence of a backoff indicator field in the subheader BI . The T field can be set to 1 to indicate the presence of a random access preamble ID field in the subheader RAPID . The reserve bit field e.g. R and R can be flags to indicate a presence of MTC specific BI value or a presence of non MTC BI value. When T is set to 0 indicating the presence of BI in the subheader one of the two reserved bits R or R can be set to 1 to indicate the presence of MTC specific BI value. The reserve bit field can be set to 0 for non MTC BI value. In one embodiment R bit can be set to 1 to indicate the presence of MTC specific BI value. In another embodiment R bit is set to 1 to indicate the presence of MTC specific BI value. The backoff indicator field BI can identify an overload condition in the cell. The size of the BI field can be 4 bits.

Using a backoff indicator BI can include a process for both the wireless device and the network e.g. node . Referring back to the wireless device can start the RA procedure without applying the random backoff the wireless device can perform random backoff based on BI before the wireless device starts the RA procedure or the wireless device may perform random backoff before starting the RA procedure based on the EAB information received or stored as described in relation to or . The wireless device can perform random backoff on a physical random access channel PRACH retransmission based on the backoff parameter as indicated by a latest MTC BI.

When the wireless device starts the RA procedure without applying the random backoff the wireless device configured with EAB can receive EAB information broadcast from the network e.g the node . The wireless device can determine if EAB information has been previously stored in the wireless device . If EAB information has not been previously stored in the wireless device the wireless device can store the received EAB information . If previously received EAB information has been stored in the wireless device the wireless device can replace the existing stored EAB information with the current EAB information received. When the upper layers request an establishment of an RRC connection while the wireless device is in an RRC IDLE mode the wireless device can check the current EAB information. If the EAB information is present and the EAB information indicates that the access is barred the wireless device may not perform random access procedure for RRC connection establishment for mobile originating calls. The wireless device can inform upper layers that the RRC connection establishment request is barred. If no EAB information is stored or the stored EAB information indicates that the access is not barred the wireless device can perform a RACH transmission procedure including a PRACH preamble transmission without random backoff. In an embodiment if a RACH transmission fails the wireless device can count a random backoff time based on the backoff parameter as indicated by the latest MTC BI . The wireless device can perform a PRACH retransmission after the expiry of the random backoff timer. In an embodiment the wireless device can recursively perform the steps of and until either the maximum limit of recursion is reached or the RACH transmission is successful and a RRC connection with the node is made.

When the wireless device performs random backoff based on BI before the wireless device starts the RA procedure no EAB information may be available or EAB information may indicate that the access is not barred. If the upper layers request establishment of an RRC connection while the wireless device is in RRC IDLE mode the wireless device can perform a random backoff based on the backoff parameter as indicated by a latest MTC BI value received before starting the RA procedure. In an embodiment if a RACH transmission fails the wireless device can count a random backoff time based on the backoff parameter as indicated by the latest MTC BI . The wireless device can perform a PRACH retransmission after the expiry of the random backoff timer. In an embodiment the wireless device can recursively perform the steps of and until either the maximum limit of recursion is reached or the RACH transmission is successful and a RRC connection with the node is made.

When the wireless device performs random backoff before starting the RA procedure based on the EAB information received or stored as described in relation to or the wireless device can count a random backoff time based on the backoff parameter as indicated by the latest MTC BI if a RACH transmission fails. The wireless device can perform a PRACH preamble retransmission after the expiry of the random backoff timer. In an embodiment the wireless device can recursively perform the steps of and until either the maximum limit of recursion is reached or the RACH transmission is successful and a RRC connection with the node is made.

At a network side e.g. at the node a module on the network side can inform the wireless devices about the backoff via the BI for PRACH preamble retransmission or a random backoff time or a maximum backoff time period from which a random backoff time can be derived for starting RA procedure by the use of the MTC specific BI parameter in the random access response RAR message. Based on the traffic conditions the network can adaptively change the value of BI to be included in the RAR. If the system is more congested the BI can be a higher value so that the wireless devices can increase the backoff delay before retrying. When the system becomes less congested the BI can be a lower value so that the wireless devices can decrease the backoff delay before retrying. Based on the segregated PRACH resource for the MTC and non MTC wireless devices or the non segregated PRACH resource for the MTC and non MTC wireless devices using the MTC specific BI subheader the value of BI can be informed to MTC wireless devices either via MTC specific PRACH resources or via MTC specific BI subheader.

The backoff mechanism disclosed for EAB can be used to reduce clustering of MTC wireless device s RACH attempts when the barring of a particular AC is lifted.

Another example provides a method for initiating a random access procedure by a wireless device after extended access barring EAB as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of releasing a bar on the wireless device wherein the bar prevents the wireless device from accessing a node using EAB as in block .
