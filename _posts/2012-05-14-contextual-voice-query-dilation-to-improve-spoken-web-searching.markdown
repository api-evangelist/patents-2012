Embodiments of the invention generally relate to information technology and more particularly to Spoken Web searching.

Spoken Web searching involves taking a voice query as input and determining the content that is an appropriate or relevant response to the query. However with existing approaches the conversion of the voice query to text can be ambiguous owing to factors such as for example the quality and or accuracy of the speech recognition system. If the query is incorrectly converted the search results can suffer. Additionally many existing speech recognition systems have low accuracy for voice queries particularly with respect to open ended queries and isolated words where the grammar syntax cannot be enforced.

In one aspect of the present invention techniques for contextual voice query dilation are provided. An exemplary computer implemented method for contextual voice query dilation in a Spoken Web search can include steps of determining a context in which a voice query is created generating a set of multiple voice query terms based on the context and information derived by a speech recognizer component pertaining to the voice query and processing the set of query terms with at least one dilation operator to produce a dilated set of queries.

In another aspect of the invention techniques for performing a search on a voice query is also provided including the steps of generating a set of multiple query terms based on information derived by a speech recognizer component processing a voice query processing the set of query terms with multiple dilation operators to produce multiple dilated sub sets of query terms selecting at least one query term from each dilated sub set to compose a query set and performing a search on the query set.

Another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an article of manufacture tangibly embodying computer readable instructions which when implemented cause a computer to carry out a plurality of method steps as described herein. Furthermore another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an apparatus including a memory and at least one processor that is coupled to the memory and operative to perform noted method steps.

Yet further another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of means for carrying out the method steps described herein or elements thereof the means can include i hardware module s ii software module s or iii a combination of hardware and software modules any of i iii implement the specific techniques set forth herein and the software modules are stored in a tangible computer readable storage medium or multiple such media .

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

As described herein an aspect of the present invention includes contextual voice query dilation to improve Spoken Web searching. At least one embodiment of the invention includes determining the context in which a voice query is created and using this context and the knowledge of a speech recognizer component to generate a multitude of voice queries. Having a large number of queries will facilitate obtaining more search results and increase the likelihood of producing the result in which the user is interested.

As described herein at least one embodiment of the invention includes removing the search dependency on the recognition of one query word by designing a mechanism to generate multiple possible variations of the query and therefore create an estimation of a query vector from a query word or phrase. Accordingly given a query q the techniques detailed herein can include generating an estimate for the query vector q q . . . q .

At least one embodiment of the invention includes generating a list of similar referred to herein as n best results from the speech recognizer. Because the speech recognizer provides a probabilistic output it can be configured so that more than one possible result can be provided. An n best list refers to the n possible text results that the speech recognizer can provide for a given audio input. In at least one embodiment of the invention such a list can be ranked for example with the probability scores of each possible result being the correct response. Additionally such a list can be filtered through dilation operators as further detailed herein. If there are fewer output results as an example if the results are of the order three or less at least one embodiment of the invention includes determining the edit distance between the dilation operator words and the n best list match.

Additionally a listing or sub set of the results can be selected from the output of each dilation filter and used to compose a query set. By way of example each dilation operator can generate possible query terms and the top k output of each such dilation operator can be chosen based on a threshold to compose the query set across all dilation operators. A search can be performed on this query set and in at least one embodiment of the invention the results can be ranked such that the results occurring in more elements of the dilation output are ranked higher.

Accordingly at least one embodiment of the invention removes the dependency on speech recognition of an entire search result set. Additionally the techniques detailed herein can improve the recall for a specific query and being specific to a user the search result can also provide a user with content that may be of relevance to him or her even if that content was not specifically searching for by the user.

As noted above at least one embodiment of the invention includes using dilation operators. In an example embodiment of the invention the dilation operators include operators that expand a query based on the questions of who what when and where. By way of example one such dilation operator can include considerations such as who the other users are having a similarity with the query user whether a user is extracted through demographics information through collaborative filtering on logs etc. as well as a weighted list of search terms that are commonly searched by this group of users.

Another such dilation operator can include considerations such as identifying the prior searches performed by a user as well as extrapolating the domain using ontologies to generate a list of search terms. Additionally another dilation operator can include considerations such as the month week and or day when the user is generating the query as well as generating a list of the query words that are generated during those times by other users. Further yet another dilation operator can include considerations such as where the query was generated obtaining such information from the demographics of the query creator and obtaining a list of query terms that are generated by people in the target region.

Accordingly as depicted in the speech recognition module generates the n best query terms based upon query term and provides the same to a dilation operations module . As described above the dilation operations module can include dilation operators such as a who dilation operator a what dilation operator a when dilation operator and a where dilation operator .

The dilation operations module via processing carried out by the dilation operators produces a query set and forwards the query set to an index database . The index database separates results from each term in the query set. As an example the output of a dilation operator can be a set of possible queries. Each query in this set will be passed to the index to search for a relevant document from the database. Thus a set of results will be generated for queries from the dilation operator . Similar results will be generated from other dilation operator queries. These independent search results through the queries of the different dilation operators and the index are sent to ranking module which ranks the query set input and generates a combined ranked list output.

In at least one embodiment of the invention the combined ranked list output is generated based on the following parameters the weight that is assigned to the dilation operators the gamma parameter as detailed further below the weight of each dilation operator w w . . . w and the score of the output of the indexed database results w w . . . w . Using these parameters ensures that the system is configurable through the parameter gamma a high value of which means that the system does not weight the dilation technique strongly and relies more on the query itself. In conditions where the speech to text quality is very good a high value of gamma should be used. However if the speech recognizer output is not reliable a low value of gamma should be used. The different weights of the dilation parameters wto w assuming that there are n dilation parameters show what value is ascertained to the different parameters based on the context of the application. The weights for the nquery w w . . . w assuming that there were k results from the indexed database for a particular query can be standard ranked.

As noted above at least one embodiment of the invention includes using the gamma parameter in connection with ranking detailed as follows 

The final ranked results can be delivered from a combination of w wand right arrow over w right arrow over w . . . right arrow over w .

Step includes determining whether filtering produces results that are less than a threshold K. This threshold is a configurable parameter that controls the number of queries that need to be created from the original query. A large value of K can result in higher precision but lower recall meaning that the search results may have incorrect documents but more documents may be retrieved. A low value of K will result in fewer documents but most would likely be relevant. If the results are not less than the threshold K a partial query set is output. If the results are less than the threshold K step includes determining the K closest matches and subsequently outputting a partial query set.

Step provides for example for cases where the speech recognizer is not able to provide a good result of the initial query. As an example the word Manchester in an original query might have been decoded as Fan wrest her. In such a case the K closest matches of the phrase Fan wrest her to the words in dilation step will be provided as an output in step . The matches can be found by using a string edit distance measure.

Step includes generating a set of multiple voice query terms based on the context and information derived by a speech recognizer component pertaining to the voice query. The generating step can include generating queries based on an ontology of search terms and or an existing word database that contains related search terms.

Step includes processing the set of query terms with at least one dilation operator to produce a dilated set of queries. Processing can include for example analyzing information about similar queries made by other users during a determined timeframe analyzing other users that have a similarity with the query user and or determining a weighted list of search terms that are commonly searched by a related group of users. Additionally processing can include identifying prior searches performed by a user as well as determining a geographic location where at least one related query was generated.

Also in at least one embodiment of the invention the amount of query dilation is configurable for different instances of searching and or for different qualities of speech recognizer.

Additionally as described herein at least one embodiment of the invention includes techniques for performing a search on a voice query. Such techniques include generating a set of multiple query terms based on information derived by a speech recognizer component processing a voice query processing the set of query terms with multiple dilation operator to produce multiple dilated sub sets of query terms selecting at least one query term from each dilated sub set to compose a query set and performing a search on the query set. The results of the search can be ranked such that results occurring in more elements of the dilated sub sets are ranked higher. Additionally the selecting step can include each dilation operator generating possible query terms and selecting the top k output of each dilation operator based on a pre determined threshold.

The techniques depicted in can also include ranking the dilated set of queries for example according to query occurrence in the at least one dilation operator.

The techniques depicted in can also as described herein include providing a system wherein the system includes distinct software modules each of the distinct software modules being embodied on a tangible computer readable recordable storage medium. All the modules or any subset thereof can be on the same medium or each can be on a different medium for example. The modules can include any or all of the components shown in the figures and or described herein. In an aspect of the invention the modules can run for example on a hardware processor. The method steps can then be carried out using the distinct software modules of the system as described above executing on a hardware processor. Further a computer program product can include a tangible computer readable recordable storage medium with code adapted to be executed to carry out at least one method step described herein including the provision of the system with the distinct software modules.
