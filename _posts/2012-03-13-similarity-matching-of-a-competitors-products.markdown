This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 023 305 filed Jan. 31 2008 which claims the benefit of the following U.S. provisional applications App. No. 60 887 573 filed on Jan. 31 2007 and entitled Analytic Platform App. No. 60 891 508 filed on Feb. 24 2007 and entitled Analytic Platform App. No. 60 891 936 filed on Feb. 27 2007 and entitled Analytic Platform App. No. 60 952 898 filed on Jul. 31 2007 and entitled Analytic Platform. 

The Ser. No. 12 023 305 application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 021 263 filed on Jan. 28 2008 and entitled Associating a Granting Matrix with an Analytic Platform which claims the benefit of the following U.S. provisional applications App. No. 60 886 798 filed on Jan. 26 2007 and entitled A Method of Aggregating Data App. No. 60 886 801 filed on Jan. 26 2007 and entitled Utilizing Aggregated Data. 

This invention relates to methods and systems for analyzing data and more particularly to methods and systems for aggregating projecting and releasing data.

Currently there exists a large variety of data sources such as census data or movement data received from point of sale terminals sample data received from manual surveys panel data obtained from the inputs of consumers who are members of panels fact data relating to products sales and many other facts associated with the sales and marketing efforts of an enterprise and dimension data relating to dimensions along which an enterprise wishes to understand data such as in order to analyze consumer behaviors to predict likely outcomes of decisions relating to an enterprise s activities and to project from sample sets of data to a larger universe. Conventional methods of synthesizing aggregating and exploring such a universe of data comprise techniques such as OLAP which fix aggregation points along the dimensions of the universe in order to reduce the size and complexity of unified information sets such as OLAP stars. Exploration of the unified information sets can involve run time queries and query time projections both of which are constrained in current methods by a priori decisions that must be made to project and aggregate the universe of data. In practice going back and changing the a priori decisions can lift these constraints but this requires an arduous and computationally complex restructuring and reprocessing of data.

According to current business practices unified information sets and results drawn from such information sets can be released to third parties according to so called releasability rules. Theses rules might apply to any and all of the data from which the unified information sets are drawn the dimensions or points or ranges along the dimensions the third party or members or sub organizations of the third party and so on. Given this there can be a complex interaction between the data the dimensions the third party the releasability rules the levels along the dimensions at which aggregations are performed the information that is drawn from the unified information sets and so on. In practice configuring a system to apply the releasability rules is an error prone process that requires extensive manual set up and results in a brittle mechanism that cannot adapt to on the fly changes in data dimensions third parties rules aggregations projections user queries and so on.

Various projection methodologies are known in the art. Still other projection methodologies are subjects of the present invention. In any case different projection methodologies provide outputs that have different statistical qualities. Analysts are interested in specifying the statistical qualities of the outputs at query time. In practice however the universe of data and the projection methodologies that are applied to it are what drive the statistical qualities. Existing methods allow an analyst to choose a projection methodology and thereby affect the statistical qualities of the output but this does not satisfy the analyst s desire to directly dictate the statistical qualities.

Information systems are a significant bottle neck for market analysis activities. The architecture of information systems is often not designed to provide on demand flexible access integration at a very granular level or many other critical capabilities necessary to support growth. Thus information systems are counter productive to growth. Hundreds of market and consumer databases make it very difficult to manage or integrate data. For example there may be a separate database for each data source hierarchy and other data characteristics relevant to market analysis. Different market views and product hierarchies proliferate among manufacturers and retailers. Restatements of data hierarchies waste precious time and are very expensive. Navigation from among views of data such as from global views to regional to neighborhood to store views is virtually impossible because there are different hierarchies used to store data from global to region to neighborhood to store level data. Analyses and insights often take weeks or months or they are never produced. Insights are often sub optimal because of silo driven narrowly defined ad hoc analysis projects. Reflecting the ad hoc nature of these analytic projects are the analytic tools and infrastructure developed to support them. Currently market analysis business intelligence and the like often use rigid data cubes that may include hundreds of databases that are impossible to integrate. These systems may include hundreds of views hierarchies clusters and so forth each of which is associated with its own rigid data cube. This may make it almost impossible to navigate from global uses that are used for example to develop overall company strategy down to specific program implementation or customer driven uses. These ad hoc analytic tools and infrastructure are fragmented and disconnected.

In sum there are many problems associated with the data used for market analysis and there is a need for a flexible extendable analytic platform the architecture for which is designed to support a broad array of evolving market analysis needs. Furthermore there is a need for better business intelligence in order to accelerate revenue growth make business intelligence more customer driven to gain insights about markets in a more timely fashion and a need for data projection and release methods and systems that provide improved dimensional flexibility reduced query time computational complexity automatic selection and blending of projection methodologies and flexibly applied releasability rules.

While embodiments disclosed herein relate primarily to the collection of sales and marketing related facts and the handling of dimensions related to the sales and marketing activities of an enterprise it should be understood that the methods and systems disclosed herein may be applied to facts of other types and to the handling of dimensions of other types such as facts and dimensions related to manufacturing activities financial activities information technology activities media activities supply chain management activities accounting activities political activities contracting activities and many others.

In an embodiment the analytic platform comprises a combination of data technologies methods and delivery mechanisms brought together by an analytic engine. The analytic platform may provide a novel approach to managing and integrating market and enterprise information and enabling predictive analytics. The analytic platform may leverage approaches to representing and storing the base data so that it may be consumed and delivered in real time with flexibility and open integration. This representation of the data when combined with the analytic methods and techniques and a delivery infrastructure may minimize the processing time and cost and maximize the performance and value for the end user. This technique may be applied to problems where there may be a need to access integrated views across multiple data sources where there may be a large multi dimensional data repository against which there may be a need to rapidly and accurately handle dynamic dimensionality requests with appropriate aggregations and projections where there may be highly personalized and flexible real time reporting analysis and forecasting capabilities required where there may be a need to tie seamlessly and on the fly with other enterprise applications via web services such as to receive a request with specific dimensionality apply appropriate calculation methods perform and deliver an outcome e.g. dataset coefficient etc. and the like.

The analytic platform may provide innovative solutions to application partners including on demand pricing insights emerging category insights product launch management loyalty insights daily data out of stock insights assortment planning on demand audit groups neighborhood insights shopper insights health and wellness insights consumer tracking and targeting and the like.

A decision framework may enable new revenue and competitive advantages to application partners by brand building product innovation consumer centric retail execution consumer and shopper relationship management and the like. Predictive planning and optimization solutions automated analytics and insight solutions and on demand business performance reporting may be drawn from a plurality of sources such as InfoScan total C scan daily data panel data retailer direct data SAP consumer segmentation consumer demographics FSP loyalty data data provided directly for customers or the like.

The analytic platform may have advantages over more traditional federation consolidation approaches requiring fewer updates in a smaller portion of the process. The analytic platform may support greater insight to users and provide users with more innovative applications. The analytic platform may provide a unified reporting and solutions framework providing on demand and scheduled reports in a user dashboard with summary views and graphical dial indicators as well as flexible formatting options. Benefits and products of the analytic platform may include non additive measures for custom product groupings elimination of restatements to save significant time and effort cross category visibility to spot emerging trends provide a total market picture for faster competitor analysis provide granular data on demand to view detailed retail performance provide attribute driven analysis for market insights and the like.

The analytic capabilities of the present invention may provide for on demand projection on demand aggregation multi source master data management and the like. On demand projection may be derived directly for all possible geographies store and demographic attributes per geography or category with built in dynamic releasability controls and the like. On demand aggregation may provide both additive and non additive measures provide custom groups provide cross category or geography analytics and the like. Multi source master data management may provide management of dimension member catalogue and hierarchy attributes processing of raw fact data that may reduce harmonization work to attribute matching product and store attributes stored relationally with data that may be extended independently of fact data and used to create additional dimensions and the like.

In addition the analytic platform may provide flexibility while maintaining a structured user approach. Flexibility may be realized with multiple hierarchies applied to the same database the ability to create new custom hierarchies and views rapid addition of new measures and dimensions and the like. The user may be provided a structured approach through publishing and subscribing reports to a broader user base by enabling multiple user classes with different privileges providing security access and the like. The user may also be provided with increased performance and ease of use through leading edge hardware and software and web application for integrated analysis.

In embodiments the data available within a fact data source and a dimension data source may be linked such as through the use of a key. For example key based fusion of fact and dimension data may occur by using a key such as using the Abilitec Key software product offered by Acxiom in order to fuse multiple sources of data. For example such a key can be used to relate loyalty card data e.g. Grocery Store 1 loyalty card Grocery Store 2 loyalty card and Convenience Store 1 loyalty card that are available for a single customer so that the fact data from multiple sources can be used as a fused data source for analysis on desirable dimensions. For example an analyst might wish to view time series trends in the dollar sales allotted by the customer to each store within a given product category.

In embodiments the data loading facility may comprise any of a wide range of data loading facilities including or using suitable connectors bridges adaptors extraction engines transformation engines loading engines data filtering facilities data cleansing facilities data integration facilities or the like of the type known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In various embodiments there are many situations where a store will provide POS data and causal information relating to its store. For example the POS data may be automatically transmitted to the facts database after the sales information has been collected at the stores POS terminals. The same store may also provide information about how it promoted certain products its store or the like. This data may be stored in another database however this causal information may provide one with insight on recent sales activities so it may be used in later sales assessments or forecasts. Similarly a manufacturer may load product attribute data into yet another database and this data may also be accessible for sales assessment or projection analysis. For example when making such analysis one may be interested in knowing what categories of products sold well or what brand sold well. In this case the causal store information may be aggregated with the POS data and dimension data corresponding to the products referred to in the POS data. With this aggregation of information one can make an analysis on any of the related data.

The interfaces may support interactions with the data mart facility by applications solutions reporting facilities analyses facilities services each of which is describe in greater detail herein or other entities external to or internal to an enterprise.

In certain optional embodiments the security facility may be any hardware or software implementation process procedure or protocol that may be used to block limit filter or alter access to the data mart facility and or any of the facilities within the data mart facility by a human operator a group of operators an organization software program bot virus or some other entity or program. The security facility may include a firewall an anti virus facility a facility for managing permission to store manipulate and or retrieve data or metadata a conditional access facility a logging facility a tracking facility a reporting facility an asset management facility an intrusion detection facility an intrusion prevention facility or other suitable security facility.

Still referring to the analytic platform may include an analytic engine . The analytic engine may be used to build and deploy analytic applications or solutions or undertake analytic methods based upon the use of a plurality of data sources and data types. Among other things the analytic engine may perform a wide range of calculations and data manipulation steps necessary to apply models such as mathematical and economic models to sets of data including fact data dimension data and metadata. The analytic engine may be associated with an interface such as any of the interfaces described herein.

The analytic engine may interact with a model storage facility which may be any facility for generating models used in the analysis of sets of data such as economic models econometric models forecasting models decision support models estimation models projection models and many others. In embodiments output from the analytic engine may be used to condition or refine models in the model storage thus there may be a feedback loop between the two where calculations in the analytic engine are used to refine models managed by the model storage facility .

In embodiments a security facility of the analytic engine may be the same or similar to the security facility associated with the data mart facility as described herein. Alternatively the security facility associated with the analytic engine may have features and rules that are specifically designed to operate within the analytic engine .

As illustrated in the analytic platform may contain a master data management hub MDMH .

The user interface may be deployed on a client device such as a PDA personal computer laptop computer cellular phone or some other client device capable of handling data. In embodiments the staging tables may be included in the MDMH .

In embodiments a matching facility may be associated with the MDMH . The matching facility may receive an input data hierarchy within the MDMH and analyze the characteristics of the hierarchy and select a set of attributes that are salient to a particular analytic interest e.g. product selection by a type of consumer product sales by a type of venue and so forth . The matching facility may select primary attributes match attributes associate attributes block attributes and prioritize the attributes. The matching facility may associate each attribute with a weight and define a set of probabilistic weights. The probabilistic weights may be the probability of a match or a non match or thresholds of a match or non match that is associated with an analytic purpose e.g. product purchase . The probabilistic weights may then be used in an algorithm that is run within a probabilistic matching engine e.g. IBM QualityStage . The output of the matching engine may provide information on for example other products which are appropriate to include in a data hierarchy the untapped market i.e. other venues in which a product is probabilistically more likely to sell well and so forth. In embodiments the matching facility may be used to generate projections of what types of products people customers retailers stores store departments etc. are similar in nature and therefore they may be appropriate to combine in a projection or an assessment.

As illustrated in the analytic platform may include a projection facility . A projection facility may be used to produce projections whereby a partial data set such as data from a subset of stores of a chain is projected to a universe such as all of the stores in a chain by applying appropriate weights to the data in the partial data set. A wide range of potential projection methodologies exist including cell based methodologies store matrix methodologies iterative proportional fitting methodologies virtual census methodologies and others. The methodologies can be used to generate projection factors. As to any given projection there is typically a tradeoff among various statistical quality measurements associated with that type of projection. Some projections are more accurate than others while some are more consistent have less spillage are more closely calibrated or have other attributes that make them relatively more or less desirable depending on how the output of the projection is likely to be used. In embodiments of the platform the projection facility takes dimension information from the MDMH or from another source and provides a set of projection weightings along the applicable dimensions typically reflected in a matrix of projection weights which can be applied at the data mart facility to a partial data set in order to render a projected data set. The projection facility may have an interface of any of the types disclosed herein.

As shown in an interface may be included in the analytic platform . In embodiments data may be transferred to the MDMH of the platform using a user interface .

As illustrated in the platform may interact with a variety of applications solutions reporting facilities analytic facilities and services such as web services or with other platforms or systems of an enterprise or external to an enterprise. Any such applications solutions reporting facilities analytic facilities and services may interact with the platform in a variety of ways such as providing input to the platform such as data metadata dimension information models projections or the like taking output from the platform such as data metadata projection information information about similarities analytic output output from calculations or the like modifying the platform including in a feedback or iterative loop being modified by the platform again optionally in a feedback or iterative loop or the like.

In embodiments one or more applications or solutions may interact with the platform via an interface . Applications and solutions may include applications and solutions consisting of a combination of hardware software and methods among other components that relate to planning the sales and marketing activities of an enterprise decision support applications financial reporting applications applications relating to strategic planning enterprise dashboard applications supply chain management applications inventory management and ordering applications manufacturing applications customer relationship management applications information technology applications applications relating to purchasing applications relating to pricing promotion positioning placement and products and a wide range of other applications and solutions.

In embodiments applications and solutions may include analytic output that is organized around a topic area. For example the organizing principle of an application or a solution may be a new product introduction. Manufacturers may release thousands of new products each year. It may be useful for an analytic platform to be able to group analysis around the topic area such as new products and organize a bundle of analyses and workflows that are presented as an application or solution . Applications and solutions may incorporate planning information forecasting information what if scenario capability and other analytic features. Applications and solutions may be associated with web services that enable users within a client s organization to access and work with the applications and solutions .

For example and without limitation an application may include enterprise resource planning backbone applications such as SAP including those applications focused on Marketing Sales Operations Planning and Supply Chain Management. In another example an application may include business intelligence applications including those applications that may apply data mining techniques. In another example an application may include customer relationship management applications including customer sales force applications . In another example an application may include specialty applications such as a price or SKU optimization application. The analytic platform may facilitate supply chain efficiency applications . For example and without limitation an application may include supply chain models based on sales out POS FSP rather than sales in Shipments . In another example an application may include RFID based supply chain management. In another example an application may include a retailer co op to enable partnership with a distributor who may manage collective stock and distribution services. The analytic platform may be applied to industries characterized by large multi dimensional data structures. This may include industries such as telecommunications elections and polling and the like. The analytic platform may be applied to opportunities to vend large amounts of data through a portal with the possibility to deliver highly customized views for individual users with effectively controlled user accessibility rights.

Such applications may rely on constant updating of statistical models such as financial models with real time flows of data and ongoing re calibration and optimization. The analytic platform may be applied to applications that require breaking apart and recombining geographies and territories at will.

In embodiments a matching facility may be a similarity facility may be associated with the MDMH . The similarity facility may receive an input data hierarchy within the MDMH and analyze the characteristics of the hierarchy and select a set of attributes that are salient to a particular analytic interest e.g. product selection by a type of consumer product sales by a type of venue and so forth . The similarity facility may select primary attributes match attributes associate attributes block attributes and prioritize the attributes. The similarity facility may associate each attribute with a weight and define a set of probabilistic weights. The probabilistic weights may be the probability of a match or a non match or thresholds of a match or non match that is associated with an analytic purpose e.g. product purchase . The probabilistic weights may then be used in an algorithm that is run within a probabilistic matching engine e.g. IBM QualityStage . The output of the matching engine may provide information on for example other products which are appropriate to include in a data hierarchy the untapped market i.e. other venues in which a product is probabilistically more likely to sell well and so forth. In embodiments the similarity facility may be used to generate projections of what types of products people customers retailers stores store departments etc. are similar in nature and therefore they may be appropriate to combine in a projection or an assessment.

In embodiments the MDMH may accommodate a blend of disaggregated and pre aggregated data as necessitated by a client s needs. For example a client in the retail industry may have a need for a rolling real time assessment of store performance within a sales region. The ability of the MDMH to accommodate twinkle data and the like may give the client useful insights into disaggregated sales data as it becomes available and make it possible to create projections based upon it and other available data. At the same time the client may have pre aggregated data available for use for example a competitor s sales data economic indicators inventory or some other dataset. The MDMH may handle the dimension data needed to combine the use of these diverse data sets.

Referring to and several types of data management challenges may be grouped into a class of problems known as similarity which may be described as the problem of finding the commonalities or similarities within data structures. While there may be situations where data comparisons fusions combinations aggregations and the like can be made directly e.g. through an explicit reference to the same item name there are many situations where there exist two things that are characterized by various attributes but where the attributes do not match. In such situations in certain embodiments a similarities facility may be used to determine if the characteristics e.g. the identified attributes in a fact or dimensions database of the two things are close enough for the things to be called similar. In embodiments the similarities facility may use a probabilistic based methodology for the determination of similarity. The probabilistic methodology may use input e.g. user input or API input to determine if the two things are similar within a certain degree of confidence and or the probabilistic methodology may produce an indication of how likely the two things are to be similar. There are many processes that can be performed on the data once two or more things are determined to be similar. For example data associated with the two things may be aggregated or fused together such that the information pertaining to the two things can be used as a projection of one whole. In certain embodiments the similarity information may be used to generate new attributes or other descriptions to be associated with the thing being analyzed. For example once a certain product is identified as similar to a certain class of products data indicating such may be associated with the certain product. New attribute data may be associated with an item and the information may be loaded into a dimensions database such that data associated with the item and the item itself can be used in projections or assessments.

A similarities facility according to the principles of the present invention may be used to assess the similarity of products items departments stores environments real estate competitors markets regions performance regional performance and a variety of other things. For example in the management of retail market information the similarity problem may manifest itself as a need to identify similar stores for purposes of projecting regional performance from a sample of as the need to identify the competing or comparison set of products for any given item as the need to identify similar households for purposes of bias correction as the need to properly place new or previously unclassified or reclassified items in a product hierarchy or for other projections and assessments. In another example again from the retail industry automated item placement may pose a problem. Often the current solution is labor intensive and may take from eight to twelve weeks for a new product to get properly placed within a store department shelf or otherwise. This delay inhibits the effectiveness of the analysis of new product introductions and in the tactical monitoring of category areas for a daily data service. However these application sets need the product list to be up to date. In addition the management of custom retail hierarchies may require that items from all other retailers in the market be placed inside that hierarchy and often the structure of that hierarchy is not based on existing attributes. This may mean that the logic of the hierarchy itself must be discovered and then all other items from the market must be similarly organized. In the current environment this process takes months and is prone to error. In embodiments of the present invention issues of similarity are automated using techniques such as rules based matching algorithmic matching and other similarities methods. In the present example the similarities facility may be used to assess the similarity of the new product with existing products to determine placement information. Once the similar matches are made new attributes may be added to the new product description such that it is properly grouped physically in the store and electronically within the data structures to facilitate proper assessments and projections.

The similarity of entities may be associated with the concept of grouping entities for the purpose of reporting. One purpose may be to codify the rules placing entities into a specific classification definition. Some examples of such specific classification definitions may be item similarity for use in automatic classification and hierarchy venue similarity for use in projections and imputations consumer similarity in areas like ethnicity and economics used for developing weighting factors or the like.

There may be certain matching requirements used by the similarities facility in the determination of similarity. For example scenarios for matching similarity may involve determining similar items related to a single specified item where the similarities engine is programmed to identify all the items in the repository that are similar to it with respect to some specific criteria e.g. one or more attributes listed in the dimensions database . The similarities engine may also or instead be programmed to analyze a list of items where all the items in the repository are similar to each of the items in the list with respect to some specific criteria. Likewise the similarities facility may analyze an item within a list of items where group items are placed into classifications of similar items with respect to some specific criteria or the like.

In embodiments the similarities facility may use a probabilistic matching engine where the probabilistic matching engine compares all or some subset of attributes to determine the similarity. Each of the attributes may be equally considered in the probabilistic evaluation or certain attributes may be weighted with greater relevance. The similarities facility may select certain attributes to weigh with greater relevance and or it may receive input to determine which attributes to weight. For example the similarities engine may automatically select and disproportionately weight the attributes associated with scent when assessing the products that it understands to be deodorants. In other embodiments a user may determine which attributes or fields to disproportionally weight. For example a user may determine a priority for the weighting of certain attributes e.g. attributes within a list of attributes identified in a dimensions database and load the prioritization weighting or other such information into the similarities facility . The similarities facility may then run a probabilistic matching engine with the weights as a factor in determining the extent to which things are similar.

An advantage of using probabilistic matching for doing similarity may be related to an unduplication process. The matching for unduplication and similarity may be similar. However they may be based on different sets of attributes. For unduplication all attributes may be used since the system may be looking for an exact match or duplicate item. This may work by matching a list against itself. In similarity the system may be looking for items that are similar with regard to physical attributes not the same exact item.

For two entities to be similar they may have to be evaluated by a specific similarity measure. In most cases they may have to be in the same domain but this also may depend on the similarity measure that is used. The similarity measure that the system may use is the probabilistic matching of physical attributes of items such as a deodorant keycat or deodorant key category where a keycat is a block of items that have a similar set of attributes. In this case since the item may be a domain and venue is a domain an item may not be looked at as being similar to a venue.

The concept of similarity may be based on the similarity of the values of attributes that describe specific entities. This may involve developing similarity measures and the metadata to support them. The process may include deciding the purpose of the similarity selecting the set of entities to be used in the similarity process analyzing the characteristics attributes and values of each entity in the set of possible similar entitles deciding which attributes will be used as part of the similarity measure deciding on the priority and weight of the set of attributes and their values defining the similarity measure defining all the probabilistic weights needed to perform the similarity measure defining the thresholds such as automatic definite match automatic definite non match or undecided match with human intervention or the like.

The measure used may be the probabilistic matching of certain physical attributes. This may be associated with automatic record linkage. Types of matching may include individual matching that may be used for the single item scenario where one file contains a single item and a second file contains a the master list of deodorants many to one matching that may be a one to many matching of individual records from one file to a second file single file grouping that may be for grouping similar items in a single list geographic coding that may insert missing information from one file into a second file when there is a match useful for adding new attribute information from external examples to the repository that does not currently exist unduplication service that may identify duplicate items in a single list or the like.

Weighting factors of each attribute and of the total composite weight of the match may be important aspects to take into account in the matching process. Since the system may use probabilistic matching the frequency analysis of each of the attribute values may be taken into account. The weight of the match of a specific attribute may be computed as the logarithm to the base two of the ratio of m and u where the m probability is the probability that a field agrees given that the record pair being examined is a matched pair which may be one minus the error rate of the field and the u probability is the probability that a field agrees given that the record pair being examined is an unmatched pair which may be the probability that the field agrees at random. The composite weight of the match also referred to as match weight may be the sum of each of the matched attribute weights. Each matched attribute may then be computed. If two attributes do not match the disagreement weight may be calculated as log 1 m 1 u . Each time a match is accomplished a match weight may also be calculated. Thresholds may be established to decide if this is a good match a partial match or not a match at all.

When doing probabilistic matching different types of attributes may be needed such as block attributes and match attributes. In this instance block attributes may divide a list of items into blocks. This may provide a better performance on the matching. The block attributes may have to match before the block of items is examined. Two keycats may have similar attributes with different sets of attribute values. A value may be the information stored in a value fact of an attribute. There may be different types of attributes such as global attributes across all keycats keycat specific attributes or the like. A category may also be used as a block. A category may be a classification of items made up of one to many different full or partial keycats.

Global attributes may be used across a plurality of keycats. Block attributes for the item domain may come from either the set of global or keycat specific attributes. Global attributes for the item domain may include keycat keycat description system generation vendor item week added week completed coding week last moved price UPC description UPC 70 character description US Item maintained brand code company code company name major brand name immediate parent company top parent company brand type minor brand name major brand short description or the like.

Specific keycat attributes may not be common across keycats. There may be more descriptive attributes that a consumer would look at. Some of these attributes may be common across multiple keycats. Most of the keycat specific attributes may be used as match attributes. However for each keycat the most important keycat specific attribute may be used as a block attribute. The match attributes may be where the true match for similarity occurs. Examples of deodorant keycat attributes may include total ounces total count base ounces store location per unit ounce product type package flavor scent strength additives form or the like. The block and match attributes may be selected from a list of deodorant specific attributes such as per unit ounce product type package flavor scent strength additives form or the like.

The similarity process for deciding if items in an item domain are similar may use a probabilistic matching engine such as the IBM WebSphere QualityStage QS . The process steps may include extraction of the items from the item dictionary now and the new repository in the future conversion of all volumetric attributes and defined attributes for the keycat into specific columns in a table using the long description as values formatting the information into a fixed length column ASCII file setting up a new project entering the data file mapping the data file columns setting up and running an investigate stage to develop a frequency analysis of the values for each of the attributes that will be used in the match stage setting up the block attributes from the list of deodorant specific attributes or the like. Another process step may be associated with setting up and running a character concatenate investigate stage for each of the attributes such as per unit ounce product type package flavor scent strength additives form and the like that may be used in the matching process.

It should be appreciated that the probabilistic matching engine methodology is but one of the many methods that may be used within the similarity facility . Others methods may include but are not limited to time series similarity methods attribute based methods spillage based methods information theory methods classification trees or some other similarity methodology combination of similarity methodologies or plurality of methodologies.
