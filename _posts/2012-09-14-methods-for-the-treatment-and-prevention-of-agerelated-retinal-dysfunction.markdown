A diminished visual acuity or total loss of vision may result from a number of eye diseases or disorders caused by dysfunction of tissues or structures in the anterior segment of the eye and or posterior segment of the eye. To understand why human vision declines with age much research has focused on the retina the layer of rod and cone photoreceptors cells that convert light into electrical signals. Studies in mice have shown that age related decreases in retinal rod cell function cannot be explained by rod cell loss abnormal retinal plasticity or any signs of retinal disease Jackson G. R. Owsley C. McGwin G. Jr. 39 3975 3982 1999 Gao H. Hollyfield J. G. 33 1 17 1992 Jackson G. R. Owsley C. Cordle E. P. Finley C. D. 38 3655 3662 1998 . Indeed Jackson and colleagues reported a dramatic slowing of rod mediated dark adaptation after light exposure associated with human aging that was related to delayed regeneration of rhodopsin Jackson G.

Age related macular degeneration AMD is one of the specific diseases associated with the posterior portion of the eyeball and is the leading cause of blindness among older people. AMD results in damage to the macula a small circular area in the center of the retina. Because the macula is the area which enables one to discern small details and to read or drive its deterioration may bring about diminished visual acuity and even blindness. The retina contains two forms of light receiving cells rods and cones that change light into electrical signals. The brain then converts these signals into the images. The macula is rich in cone cells which provides central vision. People with AMD suffer deterioration of central vision but usually retain peripheral sight.

Currently there are few treatments for retinoid deficiency. One treatment a combination of antioxidant vitamins and zinc produces only a small restorative effect by slowing the progression of AMD. Thus there is a need for methods of restoring or stabilizing photoreceptor function in aging subjects. The present invention is related to the surprising discovery that long term treatment with a synthetic retinoid derivative significantly improves age related deterioration of photoreceptor function.

The present invention provides methods of treating or preventing age related visual impairment comprising long term administration of one or more synthetic retinal derivatives.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing age related retinal dysfunction in a subject comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutically effective amount of a synthetic retinal derivative wherein the synthetic retinal derivative is administered to the subject for a period of at least three months.

In one embodiment the synthetic retinal derivative is administered to the subject about once every two weeks to about once every six weeks for a period of at least three months.

In another embodiment the retinal derivative is administered to the subject about once a month for a period of from about 6 to about 10 months.

In another embodiment the age related retinal dysfunction is manifested by one or more of the following cynical conditions an impairment in rod mediated dark adaptation after light exposure an impairment in night vision an impairment in contrast sensitivity and age related macular degeneration AMD .

In yet another embodiment the present invention provides a method of improving rhodopsin regeneration ratio in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of a synthetic retinal derivative wherein the synthetic retinal derivative is administered to the mammal for a period of at least three months.

The present methods are directed to treating or preventing age related retinal dysfunction in a subject via long term administration of a pharmaceutically effective amount of a synthetic retinal derivative.

As used herein the term age related retinal dysfunction refers to age related decreases in retinal photoreceptor function. The term is meant to include the age related impairments related to electroretinogram deficits and photoreceptor cell death and structural abnormalities that have been observed in both animal and human studies of aging. In one aspect the age related retinal dysfunction comprises a slowing of rod mediated dark adaptation after light exposure a decrease in night vision and or a decrease in contrast sensitivity. In another aspect the age related retinal dysfunction comprises age related macular degeneration AMD . The AMD can be wet or dry forms.

The terms treating treatment and the like are used herein to generally mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and physiological Effect. More specifically the synthetic retinal derivatives described herein which are used to treat a subject with age related retinal dysfunction generally are provided in a therapeutically effective amount to achieve an improvement in age related retinal dysfunction or an inhibited development of age related retinal dysfunction in the visual system of an ageing subject as compared with a comparable visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative. An improvement in age related retinal dysfunction includes long term e.g. as measured in weeks or months improvement or restoration of photoreceptor function in a visual system as compared with a comparable visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative. Improvement also includes stabilization of or minimization of additional degradation in a vertebrate visual system as compared with a comparable vertebrate visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative.

The terms preventing prevention and the like are used generally to mean preventing or inhibiting deterioration or further deterioration of the visual system of an aging subject as compared with a comparable visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative.

The term pharmaceutically effective as used herein refers to the effectiveness of a particular treatment or prevention regime. Pharmaceutical efficacy can be measured based on such characteristics as for example an increased or stabilized rate of dark adaptation a higher or stabilized rhodpsin opsin ratio a higher or stabilized rhodopsin regeneration rate or other such improvements in electrotretinographic ERG responses.

In the present methods a synthetic retinal derivative is administered to a subject. As used herein the term subject or patient refers to a vertebrate for example a mammal such as a human. In one embodiment the subject is an aging subject such as a human suffering from age related retinal dysfunction. As used herein an aging human subject is typically at least 45 or at least 50 or at least 60 or at least 65 years old. The subject has an aging eye which is characterized as having age related retinal dysfunction. Age related retinal dysfunction may be manifested by one or more of the following clinical conditions an impairment in rod mediated dark adaptation after light exposure an impairment in night vision an impairment in contrast sensitivity and age related macular degeneration AMD .

The synthetic retinal derivative is administered using long term chronic dosage regimens. In one embodiment the synthetic retinal derivative is administered intermittently for three months or longer and in another embodiment for six months or longer. The synthetic retinal derivative can be administered for example for a period of about three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven or twelve months or longer. The synthetic retinal derivative can be intermittently administered to the subject about once a day to about once every two months. Intermittent administration includes administration to the subject about once every other day about four times a week three times a week and two times a week about once every two three four five six seven eight and nine weeks and about once a month. In one embodiment the synthetic retinal derivative is administered about once every three to six weeks for a period of about three months or longer and in another embodiment it is administered about once a month for about six to ten months.

The amount of synthetic retinal derivative administered per dose can be increased as the time period between doses is increased. For example if the synthetic retinal derivative is administered less than once a day the dose per administration can be greater than the effective daily dose. As used herein an effective daily dose refers to a daily dose effective for obtaining a desired pharmacological and physiological effect i.e. a daily dose effective for treating and or preventing age related retinal dysfunction in a subject as described above .

In addition the synthetic retinal derivative can be chronically released from a controlled drug delivery formulation and or device for an extended period of time e.g. for a period of about three months or longer or for a period of about six months or longer. A wide variety of methods for controlled release have been developed and are known to those skilled in the art including pumps patches tablets implants microchips and polymeric systems.

Suitable doses of synthetic retinal derivatives will depend on the clinical status condition and age of the patient the active agent the formulation and dosage form the frequency of dosing and the like. In many instances the selection of an appropriate dose will be within the skill of a suitable healthcare practitioner such as a physician or nurse. In the case of eye drops a synthetic retinal derivative can be administered for example from about 0.01 mg about 0.1 mg or about 1 mg to about 25 mg to about 50 mg or to about 90 mg per single dose. In the case of injection suitable doses are about 0.0001 mg about 0.001 mg about 0.01 mg or about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg to about 25 mg to about 50 mg or to about 500 mg of the synthetic retinal derivative. Suitable oral doses range from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the synthetic retinal derivative. In other embodiments about 1.0 to about 300 mg of synthetic retrial derivative can be administered per dose.

In certain embodiments the dose is an oral dose of about 0.01 to about 10 mg kg body weight about 0.05 to about 7.5 mg kg body weight about 0.1 to about 5 mg kg body weight or about 0.5 to about 2.5 mg kg body weight. For example the synthetic retinal derivative can be administered at an oral dosage of about 6.4 mg kg body weight i.e. about 240 mg mbody surface area . In another embodiment the dose is an oral daily dose of about 0.1 to about 1 mg kg body weight such as an oral daily dose of about 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 or 1 mg kg body weight.

A synthetic retinal derivative suitable for the methods of the present invention is a derivative of 9 cis retinal or 11 cis retinal in which the aldehydic group in the polyene chain is modified. The synthetic retinal derivative can be converted directly or indirectly into a retinal or a synthetic retinal analog. Thus in some aspects the compounds according to the present invention can be described as pro drugs which upon metabolic transformation are converted into 9 cis retinal 11 cis retinal or a synthetic retinal analog thereof. Metabolic transformation can occur for example by acid hydrolysis esterase activity acetyltransferase activity dehydrogenase activity or the like.

The synthetic retinal derivative can be a retinoid replacement supplementing the levels of endogenous retinoid. In some embodiments the synthetic retinal can bind to opsin and function as an opsin agonist.

Synthetic retinal derivatives can be administered to restore or stabilize photoreceptor function and or to ameliorate the effects of a deficiency in retinoid levels. Photoreceptor function can be restored or stabilized for example by providing a synthetic retinal derivative as an 11 cis retinoid replacement and or an opsin agonist. The synthetic retinal derivative also can ameliorate the effects of a retinoid deficiency on a vertebrate visual system. The synthetic retinal derivative can be administered prophylactically or therapeutically to a vertebrate. Suitable vertebrates include for example human and non human vertebrates.

Retinyl esters can be formed by methods known in the art such as for example by acid catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxylic acid by reaction of an acyl halide with a retinol by transesterification of a retinyl ester with a carboxylic acid by reaction of a primary halide with a carboxylate salt of a retinoic acid by acid catalyzed reaction of an anhydride with a retinol or the like. In an example retinyl esters can be formed by acid catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid valeric acid caproic acid caprylic acid pelargonic acid capric acid lauric acid oleic acid stearatic acid palmitic acid myristic acid linoleic acid succinic acid fumaric acid or the like. In another example retinyl esters can be formed by reaction of an acyl halide with a retinol see e.g. Van Hooser et al. 97 8623 28 2000 . Suitable acyl halides include for example acetyl chloride palmitoyl chloride or the like.

Retinyl ethers can be formed by methods known in the art such as for example reaction of a retinol with a primary alkyl halide.

Trans retinoids can be isomerized to cis retinoids by exposure to UV light. For example all trans retinal all trans retinol all trans retinyl ester or all trans retinoic acid can be isomerized to 9 cis retinal 9 cis retinol 9 cis retinyl ester or 9 cis retinoic acid respectively. trans Retinoids can be isomerized to 9 cis retinoids by for example exposure to a UV light having a wavelength of about 365 nm and substantially free of shorter wavelengths that cause degradation of cis retinoids as further described herein.

Retinyl acetals and hemiacetals can be prepared for example by treatment of 9 cis and 11 cis retinals with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts. Water formed during reaction is removed for example by AlOof a molecular sieve.

Retinyl oximes can be prepared for example by reaction of a retinal with hydroxylamine O methyl or O ethylhydroxylamine or the like.

The synthetic retinal derivative can be substantially pure in that it contains less than about 5 or less than about 1 or less than about 0.1 of other retinoids. A combination of synthetic retinal derivatives can be administered.

Synthetic retinal derivatives can be delivered b the eye by any suitable means including for example oral intravenous intramuscular or local administration. Modes of local administration can include for example eye drops intraocular injection or periocular injection or delivery via a controlled release drug delivery formulation and or device. Periocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative into the conjunctiva or to the tennon the fibrous tissue overlying the eye . Intraocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative into the vitreous. The administration can be non invasive such as by eye drops or oral dosage form.

Synthetic retinal derivatives can be formulated for example as pharmaceutical compositions for local administration to the eye and or for intravenous intramuscular or oral administration.

Synthetic retinal derivatives can be formulated for administration using pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles as well as techniques routinely used in the art. A vehicle can be selected according to the solubility of the synthetic retinal derivative. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions include those that are administrable locally to the eye such as by eye drops injection or the like. In the case of eye drops the formulation can also optionally include for example ophthalmologically compatible agents such as isotonizing agents such as sodium chloride concentrated glycerin and the like buffering agents such as sodium phosphate sodium acetate and the like surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono oleate also referred to as Polysorbate 80 polyoxyl stearate 40 polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil and the like stabilization agents such as sodium citrate sodium edentate and the like preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride parabens and the like and other ingredients. Preservatives can be employed for example at a level of from about 0.001 to about 1.0 weight volume. The pH of the formulation is usually within the range acceptable to ophthalmologic formulations such as within the range of about pH 4 to 8.

Suitable pharmaceutical compositions also include those formulated for injection. For example the synthetic retinal derivative can be provided in an injection grade saline solution in the form of an injectable liposome solution or other carriers or vehicles. Intraocular and periocular injections are known to those skilled in the art and are described in numerous publications including for example Ed. G. L. Spaeth W. B. Sanders Co. Philadelphia Pa. U.S.A. pages 85 87 1990 .

A synthetic retinal derivative also can be administered in a time release formulation and or device for example in a composition which includes a slow release polymer. The synthetic retinal derivative can be prepared with a carrier s that will protect the compound against rapid release such as a controlled release formulation including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable biocompatible polymers can be used such as ethylene vinyl acetate polyanhydrides polyglycolic acid collagen polyorthoesters polylactic acid and polylactic polyglycolic copolymers PLG . Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.

Suitable oral dosage forms include for example tablets pills sachets or capsules of hard or soft gelatin methylcellulose or of another suitable material easily dissolved in the digestive tract. Suitable nontoxic solid carriers can be used which include for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharin talcum cellulose glucose sucrose magnesium carbonate and the like. See e.g. 17 Ed. Gennaro ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1985 . 

The following examples are provided merely as illustrative of various aspects of the invention and should not be construed to limit the invention in any way.

Both single dose and long term monthly dosage regimens with 9 cis R Ac were used to assess the effect of artificial chromophore augmentation on the visual function of mice. The chromophore used was 9 cis R Ac a pro drug which is metabolized and converted to 9 cis retinal to form isorhodopsin Batten M. L. et al. 2 e333 2005 . Twenty mice were employed for the single dose experiments Table 1 whereas 210 were used for the long term monthly treatments Table 1 . Mice were also gavaged with all trans R Ac n 10 and its long term effects was evaluated by selected analyses.

9 cis R Ac 9 cis retinyl acetate A2E N retinylidene N retinyl ethanolamine ERG electroretinogram LRAT lecithin retinol acyltransferase ROS rod outer segments RPE retinal pigment epithelium RPE65 a RPE specific 65 kDa protein.

Forty eight hr dark adapted 10 month old mice were gavaged with a single dose 80 mg kg body weight of 9 cis R Ac or control vehicle and exposed to strong illumination for 20 min 500 cd mthat bleached 90 rhodopsin . Next mice were dark adapted for 16 hr after which various analyses were performed . Single flash ERG conducted on treated and untreated mice showed that functional a and b wave amplitudes of treated mice were slightly increased as compared with the amplitudes in control mice a waves P

For the long term studies C57BL6 female mice were gavaged with 9 cis R Ac all trans R Ac or control vehicle monthly for 6 or 10 months.

To evaluate the effects of rod and cone mediated light responses after long term 9 cis R Ac treatments mice were examined by non invasive ERG methods. The first set of analyses was done at 4 and 10 months of age. Under scotopic conditions the amplitudes of a waves decreased with age especially at high flash intensities C1 versus C0 group left top panel whereas the changes in b waves were less evident right top panel . Under photopic conditions no differences were observed for either a or b waves lower panels . When treated and untreated groups were compared N1 versus C1 slight improvement was observed for the N1 group with respect to a or b waves at high flash strengths p

The second set of analyses was done at 14 months of age. No significant differences were found in a and b wave amplitudes between control C2 and treated groups of mice N2 and N3 under either scotopic of photopic conditions . From a wave maximal responses in dark adapted mice sensitivities and maximal a wave amplitudes were estimated and these parameters were found not to be significantly different either data not shown .

Recovery of the ERG response dark adaptation following bleach was measured by monitoring the amplitude of a waves after retinal exposure to intense constant illumination 500 cd m 90 bleached rhodopsin for 3 min. Recovery of the responses was significantly faster in the 9 cis R Ac treated groups compared with the control groups of mice at both 10 months N1 vs. C1 and 14 months of age N2 and N3 vs. C2 p

In additional control experiments mice were gavaged with an inactive isomer all trans R Ac n 10 for 10 months and evaluated at 14 months age. ERG examination showed no significant difference compared with control C2 in single flash ERG a and b wave analyses or in dark adaptation recovery n 3 . These results showed that ERG effects are specific for 9 cis isomer.

Regeneration ratios rhodopsin opsin and total amounts of purified rhodopsin showed no significant differences between control and treated groups of mice at both 10 and 14 months of age. The amounts of purified protein recovered from the treated groups at 14 months of age N2 and N3 were significantly lower than these from control mice C2 whereas the amount was only slightly attenuated in at 10 month old treated mice N1 versus C1 data not shown .

To evaluate the safety of long term administration of 9 cis R Ac A2E accumulation was measured because retinals spontaneously condense b this compound Mata N. L. Weng J. Travis G. H. 97 7154 7159 2000 Parish C. A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. 95 14609 14613 1998 . A2E and iso A2E were detected at similar levels in treated and control mice at both 10 and 14 months of age . In pre treatment controls CO 4 months old A2E accumulation was below detectable levels . Although long term treatment with retinyl esters might produce elevated levels of mitogenic retinoic acid in the liver hepatic retinoid acid levels were below detectable levels in all groups data not shown .

Animals were evaluated weekly for activity and changes in coat and skin appearance. No changes in these parameters were observed during the experimental period aside from these due to natural aging. Body weights of mice evaluated at pre treatment 10 months and 14 months showed no significant differences between control C1 2 and treated groups N1 3 data not shown .

Light microscopy revealed no major abnormalities in the retinas of vehicle 9 cis R Ac or all trans R Ac n 2 treated mice at 10 and 14 months of age and retinas from these two 9 cis R Ac treated groups were indistinguishable. Lengths of rod outer segments ROS were similar in control and treated groups at 10 and 14 months of age but were significantly decreased as compared to ROS lengths of 4 month old mice C0 whose retinal histology is shown in . The thickness of each major layer in the retina was also similar between control and treated groups. EM analysis of the outer retina and RPE layer revealed no gross differences between control and treated mice. Higher resolution of the interface between the RPE and ROS also showed no abnormalities data not shown .

DNA microarray analyses were used to document possible changes in gene expression profiles after the long term treatment with 9 cis R Ac. Expression levels of mRNA in the eye liver and kidney were determined and compared between treated N2 and control C2 groups using a 37 364 gene array provided by NimbleGen System Inc. In the eye 9 cis R Ac treatment elevated expression of 290 genes by a factor of 2 or more and attenuated expression of more than 1057 genes by a factor of 0.5 or less Table S1 . In the liver of treated mice expression of only 7 genes was increased by a factor of 2 or more and expression of only 20 genes was suppressed by a factor of 0.5 or less Table S2 . In the kidney of treated mice 90 genes increased their expression by a factor of 2 or more and 3 genes suppressed it by a factor of 0.5 or less Table S2 . The phototransduction specific retinoid processing and function categorized genes whose expressions were affected in the eye are listed in Tables S2. Protein levels of transducin Gt rhodopsin kinase guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 and guanylate cyclase activating protein 2 guanylate cyclase 1 retinol dehydrogenase 12 and LRAT were not affected in all groups of mice as assessed by immunoblotting data not shown .

As shown in these studies age related deterioration of dark adaptation in mice is attenuated by artificial cis retinoid treatment. This finding is analogous to age related declines in human vision manifested by the dramatic slowing of rod mediated dark adaptation directly attributed to delayed rhodopsin regeneration Jackson G. R. Owsley C. McGwin G. Jr. 39 3975 3982 1999 . Two different types of studies were done. Single dose studies revealed that 9 cis retinoids could enter the eye and a second set of experiments showed that long term administration of 9 cis R Ac significantly improved the deterioration of retinal function in aging mice.

These experiments were designed b test whether 9 cis retinoids enter the eyes of 10 month old mice and improve visual function. The ERG response measurably declined with age and small but measurable amounts of free opsin was present in these old mice. 9 cis retinal entered the eye when these treated mice were exposed to intense light and tested 18 hr later. The precursors of 9 cis retinal 9 cis retinyl esters were easily detectable in the eyes of these mice and the rhodopsin opsin ratio improved as well.

ERG responses to a single light flash were significantly improved in 10 month old mice that were treated for 6 months with 9 cis R Ac as compared with the oil treated controls . This therapeutic effect largely disappeared in 14 month old mice treated for 10 months possibly due to the masking effect of debilitation in the older mice. However these older mice did display a significant effect involving dark adaptation N2 and N3 groups . That long term gavage of 14 month old mice with all trans R Ac had no effect on measured ERG parameters is not surprising because only the cis form of the chromophore can recombine with opsin reviewed in Palczewski K. 75 743 767 2006 Filipek S. Stenkamp R. E. Teller D. C. Palczewski K. 65 851 879 2003 . Thus all trans retinoid would only add substrate for the isomerization reaction but not supplement the active chromophore if isomerization was attenuated. Importantly mice in captivity are maintained on high vitamin A diet thus observed effects of cis retinoids is already on the top of all trans retinoid supplementation.

Long term treatment 6 10 months was well tolerated by C57BL 6 female mice. Age related detectable morphological changes in the retina were observed in both treated and control mice were not affected by treatment. Potential toxic by products of retinoid treatment A2E and retinoic acid did not accumulate in these mice. In this study 9 cis R Ac was incorporated into free opsin within the retina resulting in increased regeneration ratio of rod pigments. However the amount of all trans retinal induced by physiological light conditions is constant regardless of the amounts of rod pigments and the regeneration ratio. Therefore it is not surprising that A2E levels were not affected by 9 cis R Ac administration. Thus the beneficial effect of cis retinoid supplementation seems more advantageous from this perspective than from the anti oxidant properties generally attributed to retinoids Maxwell S. Greig L. 2 1737 1750 2001 .

We did not detect any accumulation of retinoic acids. Moreover gene expression changes were minimal in the liver and kidney while several proteins were unregulated in the eye. Our detailed analysis of these genes did not reveal any particular expression patterns.

Humans begin to lose their ability to dark adapt beginning in the 3 4decade Jackson G. R. McGwin G. Jr. Phillips J. M. Klein R. Owsley C. 46 1422 1431 2006 . A decline in the visual function is functionally manifested by reduction in the ability to perform activities such as driving at night and reading in darkened environments Schilling O. K. Wahl H. W. 21 703 714 2006 . Such symptoms become more debilitating with age and can result in reduced independence and activity in the elderly. The problem becomes more acute as people live longer. Results of our experiments demonstrate that oral 9 cis retinoid is useful as a long term prophylactic agent and as a therapeutic compound.

The beneficial effects and relative safety of 9 cis retinoids extends to age related macular degeneration the leading cause of legal blindness in the U.S. and Europe Zack D. J. et al. 5 30 1999 . Here we have shown that there are biochemical changes in the visual cycle that occur with age namely an increase in free opsin and the opsin rhodopsin ratio. When such biochemical changes are excessive they can lead to retinal degenerations such as seen in LCA Fan J. Woodruff M. L. Cilluffo M. C. Crouch R. K. Fain G. L. 568 83 95 2005 . In addition free opsin results in spontaneous initiation of the visual cascade in rod photoreceptors Lisman J. Fain G. 1 1254 1255 1995 Fain G. L. Matthews H. R. Cornwall M. C. Koutalos 81 117 151 2001 Surya A. Foster K. W. Knox B. E. 270 5024 5031 1995 Hofmann K. P. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. 267 15701 15706 1992 Palczewski K. et al. 33 13741 13750 1994 Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K. P. 35 2901 2908 1996 . This results in a decreased signal to noise ratio in the visual system increased metabolic overload in the RPE resulting in the formation of more waste products free radicals and eventually drusen. Decreasing free opsin with 9 cis retinoid therapy will therefore lead to a reduction in the precursors that are believed to initiate AMD.

Pigmented age matched C57BL 6 female mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were maintained on a normal diet in complete darkness or on a 12 hr light dark cycle. All animal experiments utilized procedures approved by the University of Washington and Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committees and conformed to recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology.

9 cis R Ac was prepared as previously described Batten M. L. et al. 2 e333 2005 Batten M. L. et al. 279 10422 10432 2004 . A dose of 80 mg kg body weight of 9 cis R Ac in 150 l vegetable oil was administered via gavage to each treated animal. Prior to single dose experiments Table 1 10 month old mice were dark adapted for more than 48 hr gavaged with 9 cis R Ac or vehicle control solution 1 hr before bleaching exposed to light for 20 min at 500 cd mand dark adapted for 16 hr before analysis.

For the long term study Table 1 mice were obtained at 3 months of age and raised until 4 months of age before the experiments were initiated. Mice then were gavaged with 9 cis R Ac or vehicle solution once a month for different durations. Six groups of mice were studied . The first 3 groups C0 C1 and C2 total n 35 for each group were treated as controls and tested at 4 10 and 14 months of age. The other 3 groups N1 N2 and N3 n 35 were gavaged with 9 cis R Ac. Group N1 was gavaged far 6 months and tested at 10 months of age. Group N2 was gavaged with 9 cis R Ac for 10 months and tested at 14 months of age. Group N3 was gavaged with vehicle unit 10 months of age and then received 9 cis R Ac monthly until testing at 14 months of age. In another control group not shown in 10 mice were gavaged with 80 mg kg body weight of all trans R Ac Sigma Aldrich Corp. for 10 months and tested at 14 months of age.

Two weeks after the last gavage with either 9 cis R Ac all trans R Ac or vehicle groups of 48 hr dark adapted mice were analyzed for recovery of dark adaptation after light exposure purified rhodopsin opsin and retinoids in the eye and retinal morphology . Mice were exposed to light of intensity 500 cd mthat bleached 90 of rhodopsin anesthetized and monitored by ERG for one hr to evaluate recovery of dark adaptation. Rhodopsin was purified and rhodopsin opsin ratios was determined. Retinoid analyses were performed on dissected eyes removed at 0 10 30 and 60 min after exposure to the same amount of light. Mice used to evaluate retinal morphology were not exposed to photobleaching prior to analysis.

Rhodopsin purification was done under dim red light as previously described Zhu L. et al. 279 53828 53839 2004 . Purified anti rhodopsin C terminus antibody 1D4 MacKenzie D Arendt A. Hargrave P.

Mouse whole eyes were homogenized in 137 mM NaCl 5.4 mM NaHPO 2.7 mM KCl and 1.8 mM KHPO pH 7.5 with a glass to glass homogenizer. Soluble proteins in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 5 min and the pellet was solubilized in buffer containing 1 dodecyl maltoside in 10 mM Bis Tris propane pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 125 000 g for 20 min and loaded onto an antibody 1D4 packed immunoaffinity column which was then thoroughly washed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min with 10 mM Bis Tris propane pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl and 0.1 dodecyl maltoside. Purified mouse rhodopsin was eluted with 100 M nonapeptide TETSQVAPA in 10 mM Bis Tris propane pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl and 0.1 dodecyl maltoside at room temperature. Purified rhodopsin concentration was determined at 500 nm and total amount of opsin and rhodopsin at 280 nm with a Hewlett Packard 8452A UV visible spectrophotometer Palczewski K. Carruth M. E.

RNA was isolated from 10 eyes 100 mg of liver or 100 mg of kidney from groups C2 and N2 mice with a RiboPure Kit Ambion Austin Tex. . Quality of the preparation was verified by RNA agarose gel electrophoresis and the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Aliquots of total RNA isolated from the different tissues and from mice undergoing various treatments were detection labeled and hybridized on the mouse genomic microarray using a service provided by NimbleGen System Inc. Madison Wis. . The microarray contained the 37 364 genes and covering the entire mouse transcriptome as represented by the University of California Santa Cruz database build HG 17 with a minimum of 11 probes per gene. Gene expression was normalized according to probe signal and the average signal for each gene was normalized for each sample replicate.

Array data for samples across the whole study were normalized by NimbleGen Systems Inc. Madison Wis. that employed the robust multichip analysis feature of the data analysis package contained in the Bioconductor open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. Project wide spreadsheets of robust multichip analysis results were exported to MICROSOFT EXEL4 and expression level ratios were calculated for all the possible pair wise comparisons comprising one control and one treated sample. These pair wise ratios were imported to Microsoft Access and mined for credible fold changes in gene expression. Changes greater than or equal to a 2 fold increase or less than or equal to a 0.5 fold decrease were considered significant. Differentially expressed genes were then exported from Access as Excel files and were assigned functional annotations by LUCIDYX SEARCHER software by Lucidyx LLC.
