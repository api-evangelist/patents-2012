This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application having Ser. No. 61 541 508 filed Sep. 30 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Embodiments described herein generally relate to particulate binder compositions for use in making composite products. More particularly such embodiments relate to particulate binder compositions containing fillers and or extenders for use in making lignocellulose containing composite products.

Powdered or particulate curable aldehyde based resins e.g. phenol formaldehyde resole resins have found wide use as an adhesive for a variety of lignocellulose composite products such as oriented strand board OSB and other similar wafer or chip board products. Phenol formaldehyde resole resins are typically prepared by reacting a molar excess of formaldehyde with phenol under liquid e.g. aqueous alkaline reaction conditions. The resulting liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin is then spray dried to produce the curable phenol formaldehyde resin powder that is used as an adhesive.

Typical spray dried phenol formaldehyde resin powders produce lignocellulose products e.g. oriented strand board that meet or exceed desired physical properties e.g. internal bond strength. The amount of spray dried phenol formaldehyde resin powder typically required to produce lignocellulose products having the desired physical properties however adds to the costs associated with producing lignocellulose composite products.

The method can also include spray drying the aerated phenol formaldehyde resole resin to produce a spray dried particulate phenol formaldehyde resole resin. The spray dried particulate phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be combined with one or more fillers one or more extenders or a combination thereof to produce a binder composition. The one or more fillers the one or more extenders or the combination thereof can be in particulate form.

In one or more embodiments a method for making a composite product can include contacting a plurality of lignocellulose substrates with a particulate binder composition. The particulate binder composition can include a mixture of a first plurality of particulates and a second plurality of particulates. The first plurality of particulates can include one or more aldehyde based resins. The second plurality of particulates can include one or more fillers one or more extenders or a combination thereof. The method can also include at least partially curing the binder composition to produce a composite product.

The particulate binder composition can include one or more aldehyde based resins and one or more fillers and or one or more extenders. In one or more embodiments the discrete or individual particulates of the binder composition can include the aldehyde based resin and the filler and or extender. In one or more embodiments the discrete or individual particulates of the binder composition can be either the aldehyde based resin the filler or the extender. Said another way the binder composition can include a mixture of a first plurality of particulates that include the aldehyde based resin and a second plurality of particulates that include the filler the extender or a combination of the filler and extender. The first plurality of particulates can be free from any intentionally added filler and or extender. The second plurality can be free from any intentionally added aldehyde based resin. The particulate binder composition that includes the aldehyde based resin and the filler and or extender can be used to produce a lignocellulose containing composite product or composite product that meets certain physical property requirements while requiring less aldehyde based resin as compared to a comparative lignocellulose containing composite product or comparative composite product having the same aldehyde based resin but no filler or extender.

For example the composite product produced with the particulate binder composition having the aldehyde based resin and the fillers and or extender can include about 1 about 3 about 5 about 7 about 8 about 10 about 12 about 14 about 16 about 18 about 20 about 22 about 24 or about 26 less aldehyde based resin as compared to the amount of aldehyde based resin present in the comparative composite product. In another example the presence of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulate binder composition can be used to produce a composite product that contains from about 1 to about 25 about 5 to about 20 about 5 to about 18 or about 7 to about 15 less aldehyde based resin as compared to the amount of aldehyde based resin present in the comparative composite product. In another example the amount of aldehyde based resin in the composite product produced with the binder composition that includes the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders can be reduced by an amount ranging from a low of about 1 about 3 about 6 or about 8 to a high of about 14 about 16 about 18 about 20 about 22 about 24 or about 26 relative to the amount of the aldehyde based resin present in the comparative composite product with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values.

One or more properties of the composite product that can remain about the same and or improve when produced with the particulate binder composition that includes the aldehyde based resin and the filler and or extender as compared to the comparative composite product can include but is not limited to internal bond strength TB bond durability e.g. boiled internal bond BIB water absorption thickness swell and bending e.g. modulus of rupture MOR modulus of elasticity MOE maximum moment MM and modulus of inertia EL For example the internal bond strength of a composite product produced with the particulate binder composition that includes the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders can be equal to or greater than the internal bond strength of the comparative product.

Processes for producing the particulate binder composition such as spray drying freeze drying vacuum drying precipitation air drying and dry spinning a liquid mixture that includes the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders to produce a particulate or powdered binder composition are well known to those skilled in the art and a detailed description of the equipment and process variables are unnecessary. The aldehyde based resin can be mixed blended or otherwise combined with the one or more fillers and or extenders in the presence of a liquid medium to produce a liquid mixture and the liquid mixture can be spray dried to produce the particulate binder composition where each particulate includes the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders.

The aldehyde based resin can be combined with the one or more fillers and or extenders in the presence of a liquid medium by mechanical agitation e.g. magnetic sir bar impellers blades and the like. In another example ultrasonic sound waves can be used to combine the mix blend or otherwise combine the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders. During mixing of the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders air or other suitable gas or combination of gases can be injected into the mixture to further increase the amount of entrained or retained gas therein.

The one or more fillers and or extenders can also be mixed blended or otherwise combined with the aldehyde based binder during the production of the aldehyde based binder. For example as discussed and described below a suitable aqueous phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition can be produced by reacting phenol and formaldehyde in water under an alkaline condition so as to yield a phenol formaldehyde resole resin. The one or more fillers and or extenders can be combined with one of the reactants i.e. phenol or formaldehyde with both of the reactants i.e. phenol and formaldehyde or with the aqueous mixture of phenol and formaldehyde.

The processes for producing the particulate binder composition such as spray drying freeze drying vacuum drying precipitation air drying and dry spinning can also be used to produce particulates that only include the aldehyde resin. Said another way particulates of the aldehyde based resin without the presence of the fillers or extenders can be produced via these known processes and the aldehyde based resin particulates and particulates of the filler and or extender can be mixed blended or otherwise combined with one another to produce the particulate binder composition that includes discrete particulates of the aldehyde based resin and discrete particulates of the filler and or the extender. Accordingly suitable binder compositions can include but are not limited to 1 discrete particulates that include a mixture of the aldehyde based resin and at least one of the filler and extender 2 discrete particulates that include a mixture of the aldehyde based resin particulates and at least one of the filler and extender in particulate form or 3 a combination of a particulates that include both the aldehyde based resin and at least one of the filler and extender and b at least one of aldehyde based resin particulates that do not include the filler or extender particulates of the filler that do not include the aldehyde based resin and particulates of the extender that do not include the aldehyde based resin.

Spray drying refers to the process of atomizing in the form of small droplets the liquid mixture into a gas stream often a heated air stream under controlled temperature conditions and under specific gas liquid contacting conditions to effect evaporation of the liquid from the atomized droplets and production of a dry particulate solid product or particulate binder composition or spray dried binder composition. In the spray drying process the liquid mixture of the aldehyde based resin and optionally the one or more fillers and or extenders such as an aqueous mixture of a phenol formaldehyde resole resin and one or more fillers and or extenders can be atomized to small droplets and mixed with hot air e.g. air at an inlet temperature usually between about 140 C. and about 250 C. to evaporate the liquid from the droplets. The temperature of the mixture during the spray drying process is usually close to or greater than the boiling temperature of the liquid e.g. the water. An outlet air temperature of between about 60 C. and about 120 C. is common. Due to the curable thermosetting character of the aldehyde based resin adjusting the operation of the spray drying process to achieve thorough evaporation of the liquid at the lowest possible inlet and outlet temperatures is generally desired.

Spray drying is typically carried out with pressure nozzles nozzle atomization including two fluid nozzles or centrifugal or rotary atomizers operating at high speeds e.g. a spinning disc . Despite the high velocity generation of droplets a spray dryer is designed so that the droplets avoid a much as possible contact with the spray dryer wall under proper operating procedures. This effect is achieved by a precise balance of atomizer velocity air flow spray dryer dimensions e.g. height and diameter and the design of inlet and outlet means to produce a cyclonic flow of gas e.g. air in the chamber. A pulse atomizer can also be used to produce the small droplets needed to facilitate evaporation of the liquid. In some cases it can be desirable to include a flow promoter such as calcium stearate and or an aluminosilicate material in the liquid dispersion that is processed in a spray dryer simply to facilitate subsequent handling and transport of the spray dried binder composition e.g. to avoid clumping .

The aeration level of the liquid mixture also known as the gas volume fraction GVF created by the agitation of the liquid aldehyde based resin and or optionally the liquid mixture of the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders can be selected such that the liquid or liquid mixture to be spray dried has a GVF of at least 1 at least 2 at least 3 at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 at least 7 at least 8 at least 9 at least 10 at least 11 at least 12 at least 13 at least 14 at least 15 at least 16 at least 17 at least 18 at least 19 at least 20 or more than 20 based on the liquid volume of the de aerated liquid or liquid mixture. In another example the aeration level of the liquid or liquid mixture can range from a low of about 1 wt about 3 wt about 5 wt or about 7 wt to a high of about 13 w about 15 wt about 17 wt or about 19 wt with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. Those skilled in the art can select an appropriate technique for determining monitoring the GVF of the liquid or liquid mixture to be spray dried. For example suitable techniques are discussed and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 343 818 and 7 596 987. As recognized by one skilled in the art the level of aeration of a liquid GVF also can be assessed by comparing the difference between the observed aerated density and the actual de aerated density of the liquid.

The particle size and liquid content of the particulate binder composition e.g. prepared via spray drying is a complex function of the air feed rate and temperature liquid feed rate and temperature liquid droplet size and the solids concentration of the feed liquid. The particulate binder composition can have a liquid content of less than about 10 wt less than about 8 wt less than about 6 wt less than about 4 wt less than about 3 wt less than about 2 wt or less than about 1 wt . For example the particulates of the binder composition can have a liquid e.g. water concentration ranging from a low of about 0.5 wt about 1 wt about 1.5 wt or about 2 wt to a high of about 5 wt about 6 wt about 8 wt or about 9 wt with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the liquid e.g. water content of the spray dried powder can be less than about 6.5 wt or less than about 5.5 wt or less than about 5 wt or less than about 4.5 wt or less than about 3.5 wt .

The particle size distribution liquid e.g. water content and bulk density of a spray dried particulate binder composition can be controlled by operations well known in the spray drying art by variables such as feed resin solids content of the liquid mixture surface tension speed of the rotary atomizer feed rate of the liquid resin and the temperature differences between the inlet and outlet atomization gas temperature . Particle size distribution may be an important factor in production of a particulate binder composition.

The particulate binder composition e.g. the spray dried binder can be a free flowing powder that is easily handled. The particulate binder composition can have an average particle size ranging from about 0.1 m to about 150 m. For example the average particle size of the particulate binder composition can range from a low of about 1 m about 5 m about 10 m or about 20 m to a high of about 50 m about 75 m about 100 m about 125 m or about 150 m with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the particulate binder composition can have an average particle size ranging from a low of about 0.1 m about 0.5 m about 1 m about 2 m about 3 m or about 5 m to a high of about 20 m about 25 m about 30 m about 35 m about 40 m about 45 m or about 50 m with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the average particle size of the particulate binder composition can range from about 3 m to about 90 m about 10 m to about 80 m about 20 m to about 70 m about 35 m to about 75 m about 40 m to about 65 m about 1 m to about 20 m about 3 m to about 30 m about 10 m to about 20 m about 5 m to about 40 m or about 5 m to about 35 m. In another example about 80 wt to about 90 wt of the particulate binder composition can have a particle size of less than about 100 m less than about 85 m or less than about 75 m. In another example about 60 wt to about 70 wt of the particulate binder composition can have a particle size of less than about 60 m less than about 50 m or less than about 45 m. If a desired particle size is not produced directly by the technique used to produce the particulate binder composition additional mechanical grinding can be employed to reduce the distribution of the particle sizes further.

Each particulate of the binder composition can include anywhere from about 1 to about 100 individual or discrete particles of the filler and or extender. For example the number of discrete particles of the filler and or extender distributed throughout each particulate of the binder composition can range from a low of about 1 about 2 about 3 about 4 or about 5 to a high of about 10 about 20 about 30 about 40 or about 50 with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the number of discrete particles of the filler and or extender distributed throughout each particulate of the binder composition can range from 1 to about 2 from 1 to about 3 from 1 to about 4 from 1 to about 5 from about 2 to about 10 from about 3 to about 6 from about 1 to about 15 or from about 4 to about 12. Alternatively as discussed and described above or elsewhere herein each particulate of the binder composition can be either the aldehyde based resin the filler or the extender. Said another way the particulate binder composition can be or include a mixture of discrete particulates composed of the aldehyde based resin i.e. the filler and extender are not included in the discrete particles composed of the aldehyde based resin and discrete particulates composed of the filler the extender or a combination of the filler and the extender.

The individual particulates of the binder composition can have the same composition throughout. In other words any given particulate of the binder composition can have the same composition throughout that particulate. Said another way the composition of the particulates can include both the filler and or extender and the aldehyde based resin dispersed throughout the body of the particulate. Alternatively the individual particulates of the binder composition can have different compositions with respect to one another. For example some of the individual particulates first plurality of particulates can be composed of the aldehyde based resin without the presence of the filler or extender therein and some of the individual particulates second plurality of particulates can be composed of the filler and or extender without the presence of the aldehyde based resin therein.

When the individual particulates of the particulate binder composition include both the aldehyde based resin and at least one of the filler or the extender the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in each particulate of the binder composition can be the same or different with respect to any two individual particles or particulates. The amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulates of the binder composition can range from about 0.5 wt to about 30 wt based on the combined weight of the aldehyde based resin solids and the fillers and or extenders. For example the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulates of the binder composition can range from a low of about a low of about 1 wt about 3 wt about 5 wt about 7 wt or about 9 wt to a high of about 14 wt about 16 wt about 18 wt about 20 wt about 22 wt about 24 wt or about 26 wt based on the combined weight of the aldehyde based resin solids and the fillers and or extenders with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulates of the binder composition can range from about 2 wt to about 7 wt about 4 wt to about 12 wt about 8 wt to about 17 wt about 10 wt to about 22 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt based on the combined weight of the aldehyde based resin solids and the fillers and or extenders. In another example the particulates of the binder composition can include from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of the one or more fillers from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of the one or more extenders and or from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of a combination of the one or more fillers and one or more extenders based on the combined weight of the aldehyde based resin solids and the fillers and or extenders.

When the particulate binder composition includes a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates i.e. the discrete aldehyde based resin particulates do not include the filler or the extender first plurality of particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates second plurality of particulates the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulate binder composition can range from about 0.5 wt to about 30 wt based on the combined weight of the discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and the discrete filler and or extender particulates. For example the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulate binder composition that includes a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates can range from a low of about a low of about 1 wt about 3 wt about 5 wt about 7 wt or about 9 wt to a high of about 14 wt about 16 wt about 18 wt about 20 wt about 22 wt about 24 wt or about 26 wt based on the combined weight of the discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and the discrete filler and or extender particulates with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the amount of the one or more fillers and or extenders in the particulate binder composition that includes a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates can range from about 2 wt to about 7 wt about 4 wt to about 12 wt about 8 wt to about 17 wt about 10 wt to about 22 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt based on the combined weight of the discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and the discrete filler and or extender particulates. In another example the binder composition composed of a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates can include from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of the one or more fillers from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of the one or more extenders and or from about 1 wt to about 26 wt or about 2 wt to about 20 wt or about 4 wt to about 16 wt of a combination of the one or more fillers and one or more extenders based on the combined weight of the discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and the discrete filler and or extender particulates.

In at least one example the particulate binder composition can include a mixture of a first particulate binder composition containing a first aldehyde based resin and one or more fillers and a second particulate binder composition containing a second aldehyde based resin and one or more extenders. The first aldehyde based resin and the second aldehyde based resin can be the same or different. For example both the first and second aldehyde based resins can be a phenol formaldehyde resole resin. In another example either the first aldehyde based resin or the second aldehyde based resin can be a phenol formaldehyde resole resin and the other can be a urea formaldehyde resin. In at least one other example the particulate binder composition can include a mixture of a first particulate binder composition containing a first aldehyde based resin and a first filler and a second particulate binder composition containing a second aldehyde based resin and a second filler and or one or more extenders. The first aldehyde based resin and the second aldehyde based resin can be the same or different. The first filler and the second filler can be the same or different. In at least one other example the particulate binder composition can include a mixture of a first particulate binder composition containing a first aldehyde based resin and a first extender and a second binder composition containing a second aldehyde based resin and a second extender and or one or more fillers. The first aldehyde based resin and the second aldehyde based resin can be the same or different. The first extender and the second extender can be the same or different.

Similarly the binder composition that includes a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates can include one or more aldehyde based resin particulates and at least one of the one or more discrete filler particulates and the one or more discrete extender particulates. For example the particulate binder composition can include a mixture of one or more first discrete aldehyde based resin particulates one or more second discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and at least one of the discrete filler particulates and the discrete extender particulates.

The particulate binder composition can have a packed bulk density ranging from about 0.15 g cmto about 0.85 g cm. For example the packed bulk density of the particulate binder composition can range from a low of about 0.15 g cm about 0.3 g cm about 0.35 g cm about 0.4 g cm or about 0.45 g cmto a high of about 0.6 g cm about 0.65 g cm about 0.7 g cm about 0.75 g cm about 0.8 g cm or about 0.85 g cm with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the particulate binder composition can have a packed bulk density of about 0.45 g cmto about 0.57 g cm about 0.4 g cmto about 0.6 g cm about 0.55 g cmto about 0.75 g cm or about 0.35 g cmto about 0.65 g cm. In another example the particulate binder composition can have a packed bulk density of less than about 0.68 g cm less than about 0.6 g cm less than about 0.58 g cm or less than about 0.57 g cm.

The particulate binder composition can have a stroke time ranging form a low of about 1 second about 3 seconds or about 5 seconds to a high of about 25 seconds about 30 seconds or about 35 seconds with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. For example the particulate binder composition can have a stroke time ranging from about 5 seconds to about 25 seconds about 8 seconds to about 16 seconds or about 10 seconds to about 18 seconds.

The particulate binder composition can have a fusion diameter ranging from a low of about 14 mm about 18 mm about 21 mm or about 25 mm to a high about 45 mm about 50 mm about 55 mm or about 60 mm. For example the particulate binder composition can have a fusion diameter of about 15 mm to about 40 mm about 20 mm to about 35 mm about 25 mm to about 30 mm about 25 mm to about 50 mm or about 15 min to about 35 mm

One or more additional additives or modifiers can be combined with the particulate binder composition and or the liquid mixture of the aldehyde based resin and the filler and or extender and or any one or more of the liquid aldehyde based resin the filler and the extender when the binder composition includes a mixture of discrete aldehyde based resin particulates and discrete filler and or extender particulates. Illustrative additives or modifiers can include but are not limited to catalysts other cure promoters or accelerants e.g. alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates and hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide thickeners adduct forming agents e.g. urea tack promoters e.g. borax foaming agents defoamers and or surfactants. For example one or more surfactants such as nonionic surfactants can be combined with the liquid mixture of the aldehyde based resin and the one or more fillers and or extenders to adjust or control a packed bulk density of the spray dried binder composition as discussed and described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011 0136947.

The aldehyde based resin can include but is not limited to one or more urea aldehyde resins one or more melamine aldehyde resins one or more phenol aldehyde resins e.g. phenol formaldehyde novolac resin and or phenol formaldehyde resole resin one or more dihydroxybenzene or resorcinol aldehyde resins one or more phenol resorcinol aldehyde resins one or more melamine urea aldehyde resins one or more phenol urea aldehyde resins or any combination thereof. In one example the aldehyde based resin can be or include a phenol formaldehyde resin. The phenol formaldehyde resin can be a phenol formaldehyde resole resin.

Referring to phenol formaldehyde resole resin in particular the resin can be a phenol formaldehyde resin prepared under liquid e.g. aqueous alkaline reaction conditions using a molar excess of formaldehyde. For example the phenol formaldehyde resole resin can have a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol ranging from a low of about 1.7 about 1.8 or about 1.9 to a high of about 2.5 about 2.6 or about 2.7 with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. For example suitable phenol aldehyde resins can have a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol ranging from about 1.8 to about 2.65 about 2.1 to about 2.65 about 2.2 to about 2.5 about 2.3 to about 2.5 about 2.4 to about 2.55 about 2.45 to about 2.5 about 2.4 to about 2.5 or about 2.05 to about 2.55. Phenol formaldehyde resins prepared within such a molar ratio range typically have a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 1 000 Daltons to about 8 000 Daltons. Such resin compositions are commonly referred to as resole resins. As used herein the term formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio and F P molar ratio are used interchangeably and refer to the total amount in moles of the formaldehyde compound s combined with each mole of the phenol compound s and assumes no loss of the formaldehyde or phenol compounds through volatilization hydrolysis or other means.

The phenol formaldehyde resole resin can have can have a pH ranging from a low of about 7 about 8 or about 9 to a high of about 11 about 12 or about 13 with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. The phenol formaldehyde resole resin can have a viscosity ranging from a low of about 50 cP about 75 cP about 100 cP about 150 cP about 200 cP or about 250 cP to a high of about 400 cP about 500 cP about 600 cP about 700 cP about 1 000 cP about 1 250 cP or about 1 500 cP with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. The viscosity of any one or more of the aldehyde based resins discussed and described herein can be determined using a Brookfield Viscometer at a temperature of about 25 C. For example a Brookfield Viscometer Model DV II with a small sample adapter can be used. The small sample adapter can allow the sample to be cooled or heated by the chamber jacket to maintain the temperature of the sample surrounding the spindle at a temperature of about 25 C.

A suitable aqueous phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition can be produced by reacting phenol and formaldehyde in water under an alkaline condition so as to yield a phenol formaldehyde resole resin having a weight average molecular weight of about 1 000 to about 8 000 Daltons. For example the weight average molecular weight of the phenol formaldehyde resole resin can range from a low of about 1 000 Daltons about 2 500 Daltons or about 3 000 Daltons to a high of about 5 000 Daltons about 6 000 Daltons about 7 000 Daltons with suitable ranges including the combination of any two values. In another example the weight average molecular weight of the phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be between about 1 500 Daltons and about 5 000 Daltons about 1 800 Daltons to 4 500 Daltons or about 2 000 Daltons to about 4 000 Daltons.

The weight average molecular weight of the phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be determined by gel permeation chromatography GPC . The GPC method can use tetrahydofuran as a solvent diluent and a system of two mixed C chromatographic columns preceding a 500 Angstroms PLgel column all available from Polymer Laboratories now part of Varian Inc. . The column arrangement is calibrated using a range of polystyrene standards. For determining the weight average molecular weight of a particular resin sample the sample is injected along with polystyrene such as having a molecular weight of about 250 000 Daltons and toluene as an internal standard. A Model 759A Absorbance Detector from Applied Biosystems is used to monitor the column output and assist the molecular weight determination. The method of determining the molecular weight of a phenol formaldehyde resin is well understood by those skilled in the art.

Any known method capable of producing a liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be used. Suitable methods for synthesizing a liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition can include both single step processes and multi step or programmed processes i.e. staged monomer catalyst addition . While batch operations are the standard continuous processes are also possible. Standard conditions procedures and reactants for making an aqueous resole resin well known to those skilled in the art can be used.

The phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be produced by adding to a reactor containing phenol an amount of formaldehyde sufficient to establish an initial formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio F P in the range of about 0.6 1 to about 1.6 1. The formaldehyde can then be reacted under an alkaline reaction condition with the phenol to produce the phenol formaldehyde resole resin. Following the initial reaction an additional amount of formaldehyde can be added to the reaction mixture sufficient to establish a cumulative formaldehyde to phenol F P in the range of about 2 1 to about 2.65 1.

The reaction can be carried out in a liquid medium. Illustrative liquid mediums can include but are not limited to water alcohols glycols acetonitrile or any combination thereof. Suitable alcohols can include but are not limited to methanol ethanol propanol butanol or any combination thereof. Suitable glycols can include but are not limited to ethylene glycol propylene glycol or a combination thereof. As used herein the terms aqueous medium and aqueous liquid can be or include water and or mixtures composed of water and or other water miscible solvents. Illustrative water miscible solvents can include but are not limited to alcohols ethers amines other polar aprotic solvents and the like.

The aqueous phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition as produced can have a solids content of about 25 wt to about 65 wt solids about 30 wt to about 65 wt about 25 wt to about 50 wt about 30 wt to about 50 wt solids about 25 wt to about 45 wt about 30 wt to about 45 wt or about 35 wt to about 45 wt solids. As used herein the solids content of the phenol formaldehyde resole resin when combined with a liquid medium as understood by those skilled in the art can be measured by determining the weight loss upon heating a small sample e.g. 1 5 grams of the liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin to a suitable temperature e.g. 105 C. and for a length of time sufficient to remove the liquid. By measuring the weight of the sample before and after heating the percent solids in the sample can be directly calculated or otherwise estimated.

Conveniently a batch process can be used to synthesize a suitable liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition by a single stage alkaline condensation of phenol and formaldehyde under vacuum reflux at a temperature between about 50 C. to about 100 C. preferably above about 70 C. and more preferably above about 80 C.

The phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be modified by the post addition of caustic and or other additives such as urea and or ammonia which often are added to reduce the residual level of free unreacted formaldehyde in the synthesized resin. Other additives can include but are not limited to dispersants biocides viscosity modifiers pH adjusters coupling agents lubricants defoamers surfactants and the like.

When preparing a liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition an alkaline catalyst can be used to promote the reaction of formaldehyde with phenol. Illustrative alkaline catalysts can include but are not limited to alkali metal hydroxides alkali metal carbonates alkaline earth oxides or any combination thereof. Illustrative alkali metal hydroxides can include but are not limited to sodium hydroxide lithium hydroxide potassium hydroxide or any combination thereof. Generally sodium hydroxide is used based on its cost availability and suitability. Illustrative alkali metal carbonates can include but are not limited to sodium carbonate lithium carbonate potassium carbonate or a combination thereof. Illustrative alkaline earth metal hydroxides can include but are not limited to magnesium hydroxide calcium hydroxide barium hydroxide organic amines or any combination thereof. Illustrative alkaline earth oxides can include but are not limited to calcium oxide strontium oxide barium oxide or any combination thereof. In one or more embodiments the catalyst can be used in a low amount but in an effective amount to catalyze the reaction.

The liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin can also be prepared using staged addition processes which are well known to those skilled in the art. When preparing the liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin in this way formaldehyde can be added gradually to the phenol and or phenol can be added gradually to the formaldehyde and or the alkaline catalyst can be added gradually to a mixture of formaldehyde and phenol to promote a controlled polymerization.

In any of these synthesis processes the phenol formaldehyde resole resin can be prepared using reactants that are commercially available in many forms such as solid liquid and or gas. Formaldehyde is available as paraformaldehyde a solid polymerized formaldehyde and more conveniently as formalin solutions aqueous solutions of formaldehyde sometimes with methanol usually in 37 44 or 50 formaldehyde concentrations . Formaldehyde gas can also be used alone or in combination with sold and or liquid forms of formaldehyde. In at least one specific embodiment the formaldehyde can be partially or completely replaced with one or more other aldehyde compounds. Other aldehyde compounds can include but are not limited to acetaldehyde propionaldehyde butyraldehyde furfuraldehyde benzaldehyde or any combination thereof. One or more other aldehyde compounds such as glyoxal can also be used in place of or in combination with formaldehyde and or other aldehyde compounds. In at least one embodiment a formalin solution low in methanol can be used as the formaldehyde source.

Phenol used for making the phenol formaldehyde resole resins can be replaced partially or completely with other phenolic compounds un substituted at either the two ortho positions or at one ortho and the para position. These unsubstituted positions can facilitate the desired polymerization reaction s . Any one all or none of the remaining carbon atoms of the phenol ring can be substituted in a conventional fashion. The nature of the substituents can vary widely and it is only necessary that the substituent not interfere in the polymerization of the aldehyde with the phenol at the ortho and or para positions. Substituted phenols which optionally can be employed in the formation of the liquid phenol formaldehyde resole resin can include but are not limited to alkyl substituted phenols aryl substituted phenols cycloalkyl substituted phenols alkenyl substituted phenols alkoxy substituted phenols aryloxy substituted phenols and halogen substituted phenols the foregoing substituents possibly containing from 1 to about 26 from 1 to about 20 from 1 to about 15 or from 1 to about 9 carbon atoms.

Specific examples of suitable phenolic compounds for replacing a portion or all of the phenol used in preparing the phenol formaldehyde resin compositions can include but are not limited to bis phenol A bis phenol F o cresol m cresol p cresol 3 5 5 xylenol 3 4 xylenol 3 4 5 trimethylphenol 3 ethyl phenol 3 5 diethyl phenol p butyl phenol 3 5 dibutyl phenol p amyl phenol p cyclohexyl phenol p octyl phenol 3 5 dicyclohexyl phenol p phenyl phenol p phenol 3 5 dimethoxy phenol 3 4 5 trimethoxy phenol p ethoxy phenol p butoxy phenol 3 methyl 4 methoxy phenol p phenoxy phenol naphthol anthranol and substituted derivatives thereof.

The phenol formaldehyde resole resin composition can have an alkalinity i.e. contains a base in the range of about 0.5 to about 15 about 1 to about 12 or about 2 to 8 e.g. about 6 based on the weight of the liquid resole resin composition when the base is sodium hydroxide. If a different base is used the alkalinity content can be proportioned to be equivalent on a molar weight basis to the above noted range based on sodium hydroxide. For example to attain the equivalent of an alkalinity of 6 sodium hydroxide i.e. 6 grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 grams of liquid resin about 8.4 grams of potassium hydroxide in 100 grams of the resin solution would be required. As noted above the base conveniently may be an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound such as a hydroxide a carbonate or an oxide.

Similar to phenol formaldehyde resole resin suitable urea formaldehyde resins melamine formaldehyde phenol formaldehyde novolac resins and resorcinol formaldehyde resins can be prepared from melamine phenol and resorcinol monomers respectively and formaldehyde monomers or from melamine formaldehyde phenol formaldehyde and resorcinol formaldehyde precondensates. Urea melamine and resorcinol reactants are commercially available in many forms and any form that can react with the other reactants and does not introduce extraneous moieties deleterious to the desired reaction and reaction product can be used in the preparation of the second copolymer.

Suitable forms of urea if present in the aldehyde based resin solid urea such as prill and urea solutions typically aqueous solutions are can be used. Further urea may be combined with another moiety most typically formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde adducts often in aqueous solution.

About 8 000 grams of the aqueous phenol formaldehyde resole resin CEx. 1 and 2 and about 4 000 grams of the aqueous phenol formaldehyde resole resin combined with the appropriate amount of filler and or extender in Examples 1 4 were all spray dried. The aqueous mixture for each example had a solids concentration of about 34 wt . Each aqueous mixture was agitated using a high shear mixer that formed a vortex when mixing thus allowing air to be whipped or blended into the mixture to produce an aerated mixture. The aerated mixture was mixed at room temperature for about for about 30 seconds after which the aerated mixture was immediately introduced to a spray drying apparatus. The spray drying apparatus was a MOBILE MINOR spray dryer from Niro Inc. The inlet temperature of the dryer was set at about 160 C. and the feed rate of the aerated mixtures were adjusted to yield an outlet temperature of about 80 C. to about 85 C. The atomizer speed was set at 5 on the spray dryer s scale of 0 to 10.

Comparative example CEx. 1 used 100 loading while comparative example CEx. 2 used 95 loading. For the purposes of these examples 100 percent loading or loading was 1.8 wt based on the weight of the dry lignocellulose substrates. As such the amount of the spray dried resin used in comparative example CEx. 2 was about 1.71 wt based on the weight of the dry lignocellulose substrates. Examples 1 4 all used 100 loading i.e. the mixture of the lignocellulose substrates and particulate binder composition had a concentration of the binder composition of about 1.8 wt . Slack wax in an amount of about 1 wt based on the weight of the lignocellulose substrates was also added. The press used to form the panels was a Wabash Metals Hydraulic Press having press platens of 24 inches 24 inches. The press heated the panels to a temperature of about 210 C. 5.5 C. when the panels were pressed.

Each panel was pressed for a time of about 200 series of examples labeled with an A 220 series of examples labeled with a B or 240 seconds series of examples labeled with a C . For each example two panels for each of the 200 and 220 second press time were made and 4 panels for the 240 second press time were made. The formed panels were about 0.4375 inches thick 18 inches 18 inches and had a target density of 43 pounds per cubic foot pcf . The internal bond strength for each example was measured and determined according to the test procedure provided for in ASTM D1037 06a. The internal bond strength of 144 samples for each example was tested with the average value for each example shown in Table 2 below. Standard statistical methods were used to derive the data shown in Table 2.

The results of the internal bond strengths for the panels of CEx 1 and 2 and Ex. 1 4 were compared in more detail Tables 3 5 by using Bayesian methods. Table 3 below shows the Comparison of Means for the Internal Bond at the 200 second press time.

As shown in Tables 2 3 4 and or 5 the internal bond strength for Ex. 1A 4A all trended slightly lower than comparative example CEx. 1A. The comparative example CEx. 2A that was at only 95 loading yielded significantly lower internal bond strength as compared to comparative example CEx. 1A. The internal bond strength for Ex. 1B 3B all trended slightly lower than comparative example CEx. 1A. The internal bond strength for Ex. 4B however was slightly inside the significances threshold and with a trend above that of the comparative example CEx. 1B. The comparative example CEx. 2B again yielded significantly lower internal bond strength as compared to comparative example CEx. 1B. The internal bond strength Ex. 1C 3C and 4C all trended slightly lower than comparative example CEx. 1C. The internal bond strength for Ex. 2C however was slightly inside the significances threshold and with a trend above that of the comparative example CEx. 1C. The comparative example CEx. 2C again yielded significantly lower internal bond strength as compared to comparative example CEx. 1C. The data in Tables 2 5 shows that at the 240 second press time the binder compositions of Ex. 1 4 are all statistically equivalent to the comparative example CEx. 1.
