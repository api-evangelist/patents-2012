This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. The mechanical energy can further be used to produce electricity. A wind turbine can rotate about either a horizontal axis or a vertical axis. A wind turbine that rotates about a horizontal axis is referred to as a horizontal axis wind turbine and a wind turbine that rotates about a vertical axis is referred to as a vertical axis wind turbine.

A horizontal axis wind turbine typically has a main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower where the main rotor shaft is commonly pointed into the wind to generate electric power. Oftentimes a blade of a horizontal axis wind turbine continuously produces power in a revolution around a rotation axis. Further horizontal axis wind turbines are conventionally controlled in various manners. For instance a speed at which blades of a horizontal axis wind turbine rotate is oftentimes controlled by a connection to an electrical grid. Moreover torque produced by the horizontal axis wind turbine can be controlled by pitching the blades of the horizontal axis wind turbine. According to an example a control system of a horizontal axis wind turbine can adjust blade pitch to maintain the torque of the rotor to be within operating limits as wind speed changes. Following this example the blades of the horizontal axis wind turbine can be feathered where an angle of attack is minimized by turning the blades to be parallel to airflow to stop the machine when wind speed exceeds a maximum cut out speed.

In contrast to a horizontal axis wind turbine a vertical axis wind turbine has a main rotor shaft arranged vertically thus the vertical axis wind turbine need not be pointed into the wind to operate. As opposed to continuously producing power through a revolution a blade of a vertical axis wind turbine produces power in two bursts within a revolution around the rotation axis e.g. the blade sweeps through the air in an upwind pass and a downwind pass . However significant pulsatory torque can be produced during each revolution of a blade in the upwind and downwind passes which can result in machine fatigue. Further conventional vertical axis wind turbines can be prone to damage due to going into overspeed e.g. if a connection with an electrical grid is lost or a brake of the vertical axis wind turbine fails . Often conventional blade pitching used for horizontal axis wind turbines may be unable to be employed for vertical axis wind turbines.

Described herein are various technologies that pertain to a vertical axis wind turbine blade configured to rotate about a rotation axis. The vertical axis wind turbine blade includes at least an attachment segment a rear swept segment and optionally a forward swept segment. The attachment segment is contiguous with the forward swept segment and the forward swept segment is contiguous with the rear swept segment. The attachment segment includes a first portion of a centroid axis the forward swept segment includes a second portion of the centroid axis and the rear swept segment includes a third portion of the centroid axis. The second portion of the centroid axis is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis and the third portion of the centroid axis is angularly displaced behind the first portion of the centroid axis in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis. In various embodiments the vertical axis wind turbine blade can lack the forward swept segment in accordance with such embodiments the attachment segment is contiguous with the rear swept segment.

According to various embodiments the vertical axis wind turbine blade can be included in a Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine a U shaped vertical axis wind turbine a V shaped vertical axis wind turbine an H shaped vertical axis wind turbine or the like. For instance in a Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine the vertical axis wind turbine blade can further include a second forward swept segment and a second attachment segment where the second forward swept segment is contiguous with the rear swept segment and the second attachment segment is contiguous with the second forward swept segment. By way of another illustration in an H shaped vertical axis wind turbine the vertical axis wind turbine blade can further include a second forward swept segment and a second rear swept segment the second forward swept segment can be contiguous with the attachment segment and the second rear swept segment can be contiguous with the second forward swept segment.

Vertical axis wind turbine blades provided herein can twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about a rotation axis to passively control overspeed. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades can twist into an airflow direction when the vertical axis blades are aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation. According to other embodiments a vertical axis wind turbine blade can twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about the rotation axis to passively control overspeed and twist into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blade is aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation due to orientation of fibers of an orthotropic laminate within a blade structure.

The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various technologies pertaining to vertical axis wind turbine blades are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects. Further it is to be understood that functionality that is described as being carried out by certain system components may be performed by multiple components. Similarly for instance a component may be configured to perform functionality that is described as being carried out by multiple components.

Moreover the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or. That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B. In addition the articles a and an as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean one or more unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.

As used herein the term centroid axis refers to a locus of points corresponding to respective centroids of airfoil cross sections of a vertical axis wind turbine blade along a span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade. Many of the embodiments described herein pertain to a portion of the centroid axis being angularly displaced ahead of or behind a disparate portion of the centroid axis. It is to be appreciated however that such relative angular displacements can be based on other spanwise axes of the vertical axis wind turbine blade e.g. a leading edge axis that is a locus of points corresponding to respective leading edges of airfoil cross sections of the vertical axis wind turbine blade along the span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade a trailing edge axis that is a locus of points corresponding to respective trailing edges of airfoil cross sections of the vertical axis wind turbine blade along the space of the vertical axis wind turbine blade etc. .

Pursuant to various examples the airfoil cross sections of the vertical axis wind turbine blades can be symmetric airfoils. However according to other examples it is to be appreciated that the airfoil cross sections of the vertical axis wind turbine blades can be asymmetric airfoils. For instance substantially any shaped airfoil is intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims.

Set forth herein are various vertical axis wind turbine blades configured to rotate about a rotation axis. The vertical axis wind turbine blades described herein can twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about the rotation axis to passively control overspeed. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades presented herein can twist into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blades are aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation. Coupling blade twist with rotational or aerodynamic loading of vertical axis wind turbine blades can increase turbine efficiency smooth power output and provide for aerodynamic braking during operation.

According to an example geometric sweep of a blade structure can cause a vertical axis wind turbine blade to twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about the rotation axis to passively control overspeed and twist into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blade is aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation. Following this example various vertical axis wind turbine blade designs with rear swept segments are herein e.g. sweep twist coupled configurations where such rear swept segments can be configured to twist the vertical axis wind turbine blades into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blade is aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation. Moreover the rear swept segments can be configured to increasingly twist the vertical axis wind turbine blade in proportion to a rate of rotation about the rotation axis to increase drag for passive overspeed control.

A rear swept segment positions mass of a vertical axis wind turbine blade behind other portions of the blade in a direction of rotation about a rotation axis. Thus as the blade rotates around the rotation axis the mass can pull outwards which can twist the blade.

By way of another example orientation of fibers of an orthotropic laminate within a blade structure e.g. for extension twist coupled and bend twist coupled configurations can cause a vertical axis wind turbine blade to twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about the rotation axis to passively control overspeed and twist into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blade is aerodynamically loaded to smooth cyclic load and power variation.

Referring now to the drawings illustrate an exemplary sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine . More particularly illustrates a first side view of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a second side view of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a top view of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine and illustrates an isometric view of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine . In the below discussion of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine reference is collectively made to .

The sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine includes a plurality of vertical axis wind turbine blades namely a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades . While three vertical axis wind turbine blades are illustrated as being included in the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine it is to be appreciated that fewer than or more than three such blades can be included therein. Moreover the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine includes a tower that extends along a rotation axis e.g. the rotation axis is represented as a dotted line .

Each of the vertical axis wind turbine blades of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine can have a troposkein or spinning rope shape but non troposkein shapes for the vertical axis wind turbine blades are also contemplated. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades are coupled with the tower . Each of the vertical axis wind turbine blades is coupled with the tower at two ends e.g. a top end and a bottom end of the vertical axis wind turbine blade is coupled with the tower etc. . Further the vertical axis wind turbine blades are configured to rotate about the rotation axis . illustrates a direction of rotation for the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine . Moreover a wind direction is depicted in .

The vertical axis wind turbine blades of the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine are each swept in a direction of a trailing edge e.g. rear sweep towards a maximum angular displacement at a maximum radius from the rotation axis . For instance a maximum angular displacement of the vertical axis wind turbine blade has a maximum radial distance from the rotation axis . An effect of such sweeping is that the vertical axis wind turbine blades can twist into an inflow direction when the blades are aerodynamically loaded which can smooth cyclic load and power variation. Moreover as a rate of rotation of the vertical axis wind turbine blades increases a lateral part of the vertical axis wind turbine blades can have an increasing amount of static twist which can serve to increase drag over the entire rotation thereby creating a passive speed limitation for overspeed control. Further the vertical axis wind turbine blades can also be swept towards a leading edge e.g. forward sweep near blade attachment points e.g. attachment segments to provide for pitch moment balancing.

A description of the vertical axis wind turbine blade is set forth below. It is to be appreciated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade and the vertical axis wind turbine blade can be substantially similar to the vertical axis wind turbine blade described below.

The vertical axis wind turbine blade includes a first attachment segment a first forward swept segment a rear swept segment a second forward swept segment and a second attachment segment . For instance the first forward swept segment and the second forward swept segment can balance torque loads along the vertical axis wind turbine blade . However in accordance with other embodiments it is contemplated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade can optionally omit the first forward swept segment and the second forward swept segment e.g. the first attachment segment can be contiguous with the rear swept segment and the rear swept segment can be contiguous with the second attachment segment .

The first attachment segment and the second attachment segment are respectively coupleable with a tower e.g. as depicted in the first attachment segment and the second attachment segment are coupled with the tower . The first attachment segment includes a first portion of a centroid axis . The centroid axis is represented as a dashed line along the span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade .

The first forward swept segment includes a second portion of the centroid axis a first proximal side and a first distal side . As used herein pertaining to the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine proximal sides and distal sides are relative to the first attachment segment .

Further the second portion of the centroid axis of the first forward swept segment is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis . For instance shows such relative angular displacement between the first and second portions of the centroid axis . More particularly the first forward swept segment is illustrated as being canted towards a leading edge e.g. to the left in the illustrated view of relative to the first attachment segment e.g. the second portion of the centroid axis of the first forward swept segment is left of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment in .

The rear swept segment includes a third portion of the centroid axis a second proximal side and a second distal side . The second proximal side of the rear swept segment is contiguous with the first distal side of the first forward swept segment . Further the third portion of the centroid axis of the rear swept segment is angularly displaced behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis . Such angular displacement behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment is shown for example in where the third portion of the centroid axis of the rear swept segment is right of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment . Thus as depicted in the rear swept segment is illustrated as being canted towards a trailing edge e.g. to the right in the illustrated view of relative to the first attachment segment .

The sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine blade further includes the second forward swept segment where the second forward swept segment includes a fourth portion of the centroid axis a third proximal side and a third distal side . The third proximal side of the second forward swept segment is contiguous with the second distal side of the rear swept segment . Further the fourth portion of the centroid axis of the second forward swept segment is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis . The angular displacement ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment is shown for instance in as illustrated the fourth portion of the centroid axis of the second forward swept segment is left of the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment . Accordingly as depicted in the second forward swept segment is illustrated as being canted towards a leading edge e.g. to the left in the illustrated view of relative to the first attachment segment .

Moreover the second attachment segment includes a fifth portion of the centroid axis . The second attachment segment is contiguous with the third distal side of the second forward swept segment .

Moreover the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment and the fifth portion of the centroid axis of the second attachment segment are at substantially similar angular positions about the rotation axis . For instance as shown in the first attachment segment and the second attachment segment are illustrated as being inline vertically. It is contemplated that substantially similar can mean less than or equal to a five degree angular displacement between the first attachment segment and the second attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis yet it is contemplated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited.

Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blade has a maximum angular displacement within the rear swept segment at a maximum radial distance between the rotation axis and the vertical axis wind turbine blade . Accordingly the third portion of the centroid axis of the rear swept segment has at the maximum radial distance between the rotation axis and the vertical axis wind turbine blade the maximum angular displacement behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the first attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis .

Now turning to illustrated is an exemplary sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine . Moreover it is contemplated that the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine shown in can be similar to a sweep twist coupled V shaped vertical axis wind turbine e.g. blades of a sweep twist coupled V shaped vertical axis wind turbine can be outwardly slanted rather than convexly curved . For sake of brevity such sweep twist coupled V shaped vertical axis wind turbine is not shown herein.

Similar to the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine shown in the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine includes three vertical axis wind turbine blades. More particularly the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine includes a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades . Again it is contemplated that the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine can include substantially any number of such blades and accordingly is not limited to the depicted illustration.

Moreover the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine includes a tower . As shown the tower can be a hub yet it is contemplated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades are configured to rotate about a rotation axis that extends through the tower in a direction of rotation e.g. the rotation axis is represented as a dotted line . Further a wind direction is illustrated in .

The vertical axis wind turbine blades of the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine are each swept in a direction of a trailing edge from towards a respective tip. An effect of such sweep is that the vertical axis wind turbine blades can twist into an airflow direction when the blades are aerodynamically loaded which can smooth cyclical load and power variation. Additionally as the rate of rotation about the rotation axis increases the vertical axis wind turbine blades can bend due to centrifugal forces causing a lateral surface of such blades to have an increasing amount of static twist that can serve to increase drag over an entire rotation about the rotation axis . Such static twist can create a passive speed limitation for overspeed control. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades can be swept towards the leading edge near blade attachment points e.g. attachment segments to provide for pitch moment balancing.

Again a description is set forth below for one of the vertical axis wind turbine blades namely the vertical axis wind turbine blade . It is contemplated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade and the vertical axis wind turbine blade can be substantially similar to the vertical axis wind turbine blade as set forth below.

The vertical axis wind turbine blade includes an attachment segment a forward swept segment and a rear swept segment . The forward swept segment can balance torque loads along the vertical axis wind turbine blade . However in accordance with other embodiments it is contemplated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade can optionally omit the forward swept segment e.g. the attachment segment can be contiguous with the rear swept segment .

The attachment segment is coupleable with a tower e.g. the attachment segment is coupled with the tower in . The attachment segment includes a first portion of a centroid axis where the centroid axis is represented as a dashed line along the span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade .

The forward swept segment includes a second portion of the centroid axis a first proximal side and a first distal side . As used herein pertaining to the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine proximal sides and distal sides are relative to the attachment segment . The first proximal side of the forward swept segment is contiguous with the attachment segment . Moreover the second portion of the centroid axis of the forward swept segment is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis . For instance shows the relative angular displacement between the first and second portions of the centroid axis . The forward swept segment is illustrated as being canted towards a leading edge e.g. to the left in the illustrated view of relative to the attachment segment thus the second portion of the centroid axis of the forward swept segment is left of the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in .

Moreover the rear swept segment includes a third portion of the centroid axis a second proximal side and a second distal side . The second proximal side of the rear swept segment is contiguous with the first distal side of the forward swept segment . Further the third portion of the centroid axis of the rear swept segment is angularly displaced behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis . The angular displacement behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment is shown for example in where the third portion of the centroid axis of the rear swept segment is right of the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment . Thus as depicted in the rear swept segment is illustrated as being canted towards a trailing edge e.g. to the right in the illustrated view of relative to the attachment segment .

Further the attachment segment is a root of the vertical axis wind turbine blade and the second distal side of the rear swept segment is a tip of the vertical axis wind turbine blade . As shown in a radial distance between the rotation axis and the vertical axis wind turbine blade increases along the span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade towards a maximum radial distance at the tip e.g. the second distal side .

Moreover as depicted in the vertical axis wind turbine blade is convexly curved towards a lateral surface of the vertical axis wind turbine blade . However according to other embodiments e.g. for a sweep twist coupled V shaped vertical axis wind turbine a vertical axis wind turbine blade can be outwardly slanted relative to a rotation axis from an attachment segment to a rear swept segment. However it is contemplated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited.

Now turning to illustrated is an exemplary sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine . depicts a first side view of the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a second side view of the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a top view of the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine and illustrates an isometric view of the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine .

Similar to above the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine includes three blades a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades . Again it is contemplated that the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine can include substantially any number of vertical axis wind turbine blades and is not limited to the three blades as illustrated in .

The sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine further includes a tower that extends along a rotation axis e.g. the rotation axis is represented as a dotted line .

The struts and are similarly coupled with the vertical axis wind turbine blades and .

Similar to the above discussion pertaining to the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine of the vertical axis wind turbine blades of the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine can each be swept in a direction of a trailing edge towards a tip e.g. the second distal side and the fourth distal side . The effect of such sweeping is that the vertical axis wind turbine blades can twist into an inflow direction when the blades are aerodynamically loaded which can smooth cyclic load and power variation. Additionally as the rate of rotation increases the vertical axis wind turbine blades can bend due to centrifugal forces causing lateral surfaces of the blades to have an increasing amount of static twist that can serve to increase drag over an entire rotation thereby providing passive speed limitation which can provide overspeed control. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades can be swept towards the leading edge near attachment points e.g. attachment segments of such blades which can provide for pitch moment balance.

The vertical axis wind turbine blade is described in further detail below. It is to be appreciated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade and the vertical axis wind turbine blade can be substantially similar to the below description of the vertical axis wind turbine blade .

The vertical axis wind turbine blade includes an attachment segment a first forward swept segment a second forward swept segment a first rear swept segment and a second rear swept segment . For instance the first forward swept segment and the second forward swept segment can balance torque loads along the vertical axis wind turbine blade . However in accordance with other embodiments it is contemplated that the vertical axis wind turbine blade can optionally omit the first forward swept segment and the second forward swept segment e.g. the attachment segment can be contiguous with the first rear swept segment and the second rear swept segment .

The attachment segment can be a root of the vertical axis wind turbine blade . Moreover the attachment segment is coupleable with a first end of a strut where a second end of the strut is coupleable with a tower as depicted the attachment segment is coupled with the first end of the strut and the second end of the strut is coupled with the tower . Further the attachment segment includes a first portion of a centroid axis where the centroid axis is represented as a dashed line along the span of the vertical axis wind turbine blade .

The first forward swept segment includes a second portion of the centroid axis a first proximal side and a first distal side . As used herein pertaining to the sweep twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine proximal sides and distal sides are relative to the attachment segment . The first proximal side of the first forward swept segment is contiguous with the attachment segment . Further the second portion of the centroid axis of the first forward swept segment is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis .

The first rear swept segment includes a third portion of the centroid axis a second proximal side and a second distal side . The second proximal side of the first rear swept segment is contiguous with the first distal side of the first forward swept segment . Moreover the third portion of the centroid axis of the first rear swept segment is angularly displaced behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis .

The second forward swept segment includes a fourth portion of the centroid axis a third proximal side and a third distal side . The third proximal side of the second forward swept segment is contiguous with the attachment segment . As illustrated the first forward swept segment and the second forward swept segment are at opposite sides of the attachment segment in a vertical direction. Moreover the fourth portion of the centroid axis of the second forward swept segment is angularly displaced ahead of the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis .

The second rear swept segment includes a fifth portion of the centroid axis a fourth proximal side and a fourth distal side . The fourth proximal side of the second rear swept segment is contiguous with the third distal side of the second forward swept segment . Moreover the fifth portion of the centroid axis of the second rear swept segment is angularly displaced behind the first portion of the centroid axis of the attachment segment in the direction of rotation about the rotation axis .

The second distal side of the first rear swept segment is a first tip of the vertical axis wind turbine blade . The fourth distal side of the second rear swept segment is a second tip of the vertical axis wind turbine blade . As illustrated in a first radial distance between the rotation axis and the first tip is substantially similar to a second radial distance between the rotation axis and the second tip e.g. substantially similar can be less than five percent difference .

In accordance with other embodiments rather than including a sweep in a blade structure orientation of fibers of an orthotropic laminate can cause a vertical axis wind turbine blade to twist. For instance the orientation of the fibers of the orthotropic laminate from which a vertical axis wind turbine blade is made can cause the vertical axis wind turbine blade to twist in proportion to a rate of rotation about a rotation axis which can passively control overspeed. Moreover the orientation of the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can cause the vertical axis wind turbine blade to turn into an airflow direction when the vertical axis wind turbine blade is aerodynamically loaded which can smooth cyclic load and power variation. The fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated with respect to a blade axis of the vertical axis wind turbine blade e.g. rather than the fibers being parallel to the blade axis . For example the blade axis of the vertical axis wind turbine blade can be a centroid axis of the vertical axis wind turbine blade.

An orthotropic laminate from which a vertical axis wind turbine blade is constructed can be a composite material that includes fibers. Examples of the fibers include glass fibers carbon fibers Kevlar or the like. For instance the composite material can be glass fibers with surrounding plastic carbon fibers with surrounding plastic etc. yet the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing examples.

With reference to illustrated is an exemplary extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine . illustrates a first side view of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a second side view of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a top view of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine and illustrates an isometric view of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine .

As illustrated the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine includes three vertical axis wind turbine blades a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades . Yet it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine including the three blades and instead can include more than or fewer than three such blades. In contrast to the sweep twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine shown in the vertical axis wind turbine blades of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine lack geometric sweeps. Again the vertical axis wind turbine blades can have a troposkein shape however other shapes of the vertical axis wind turbine blades are also intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. Moreover the vertical axis wind turbine blades are each coupled with a tower that extends along a rotation axis . illustrates a direction of rotation of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine and a wind direction .

With reference to illustrated are side views of exemplary portions of the vertical axis wind turbine blade of the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine of . More particularly illustrates a portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade of below a mid line and illustrates a portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade of above the mid line . The mid line can be a airfoil cross section that has a maximum radial distance between the rotation axis and the vertical axis wind turbine blade for example. Both side views of are viewed as looking downwind as the vertical axis wind turbine blade passes in front of the rotation axis e.g. a view of the vertical axis wind turbine blade as illustrated in .

Turning to the portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade includes a nose a tail a lateral surface and a medial surface . The lateral surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated clockwise with respect to a blade axis from the view depicted in . For example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . The medial surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated counter clockwise with respect to the blade axis from the view depicted in . According to an example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated counter clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . Thus the fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the lateral surface can be oriented in an opposite direction as compared to fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the medial surface .

As shown in the portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade includes a nose a tail a lateral surface and a medial surface . Again on opposing surfaces e.g. the lateral surface and the medial surface of the portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade the orthotropic laminate has opposite fiber directions. More particularly the lateral surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated counter clockwise with respect to a blade axis from the view depicted in . For example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated counter clockwise between 15 and 30 with respect to the blade axis . The medial surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated clockwise with respect to the blade axis from the view depicted in . According to an example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated clockwise between 15 and 30 with respect to the blade axis . Thus the fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the lateral surface can be oriented in an opposite direction as compared to fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the medial surface .

As the extension twist coupled Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine of is rotated around the rotation axis with the vertical axis wind turbine blades each held at respective ends such blades are placed in tension. As the speed of rotation of the vertical axis wind turbine blades around the rotation axis increases the vertical axis wind turbine blades stretch. Such stretching causes the fibers of the orthotropic laminate to twist the vertical axis wind turbine blades . For instance the nose of the portion is pitched inwards e.g. since the portion is from below the mid line when the vertical axis wind turbine blade extends. Similarly the nose of the portion is pitched inwards e.g. since the portion is from above the mid line when the vertical axis wind turbine blade extends. The inward twisting can increase drag which can provide a stopping force for overspeed control.

Now turning to illustrated is an exemplary bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine . illustrates a first side view of the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a second side view of the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a top view of the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine and illustrates an isometric view of the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine .

Again in the depicted example the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine is shown as including three vertical axis wind turbine blades namely a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades however the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Moreover roots of the vertical axis wind turbine blades are respectively coupled with a tower e.g. a hub where the tower is along a rotation axis . The vertical axis wind turbine blades rotate about the rotation axis in a direction of rotation with a wind direction . Further for sake of brevity it is to be appreciated that a bend twist coupled V shaped vertical axis wind turbine can be substantially similar to the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine as described herein with blades outwardly slanted in the V shaped vertical axis wind turbine rather than convexly curved as shown in .

In contrast to the swept geometric design of the sweep twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine shown in the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine of twists due to orientation of orthotropic laminate fibers. More particularly the vertical axis wind turbine blades are constructed of layers of orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated with respect to a blade axis.

The portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade includes a nose a tail a lateral surface and a medial surface . The lateral surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated clockwise with respect to a blade axis from the view depicted in . For example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . The medial surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers similarly rotated clockwise with respect to the blade axis from the view depicted in . According to an example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . Thus the fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the lateral surface can be oriented in a substantially similar direction as compared to fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the medial surface . Accordingly when the vertical axis wind turbine blade bends towards the tower the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and can cause the nose to be pitched inwards. Moreover when the vertical axis wind turbine blade bends away from the tower the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and can cause the nose to be pitched outwards.

An effect of such rotation of the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and can be that the blade can twist into an inflow direction when the blade is aerodynamically loaded which can smooth the cyclic load and power variation. Moreover as the rate of rotation increases the blade can bend due to centrifugal forces which can cause the lateral surface of the blade to have an increasing amount of static twist that serves to increase drag over the entire rotation which can create a passive speed limitation for overspeed control.

With reference to illustrated is an exemplary bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine . illustrates a first side view of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a second view of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine illustrates a top view of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine and illustrates an isometric view of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine .

Again the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine is illustrated as including three vertical axis wind turbine blades a first vertical axis wind turbine blade a second vertical axis wind turbine blade and a third vertical axis wind turbine blade collectively referred to herein as vertical axis wind turbine blades . Yet it is contemplated that other numbers of blades are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. Each of the vertical axis wind turbine blades are respectively coupled with a corresponding strut e.g. the vertical axis wind turbine blade is coupled with a strut the vertical axis wind turbine blade is coupled with a strut and the vertical axis wind turbine blade is coupled with a strut . Further the struts are coupled at opposite ends to a tower around which the blades rotate e.g. in a direction of rotation with a wind direction . The tower extends along a rotation axis depicted as a dotted line .

Similar to the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine of the vertical axis wind turbine blades of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine of are made of layers of orthotropic laminate rotated from a blade axis direction wherein such rotation is in a substantially similar direction on medial and lateral surfaces. More particularly the portion depicted in also shows an orientation of the fibers of the orthotropic laminates for the vertical axis wind turbine blade above the strut . Further illustrates a portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade below the strut .

The portion of the vertical axis wind turbine blade includes a nose a tail a lateral surface and a medial surface . The lateral surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers rotated counter clockwise with respect to a blade axis from the view depicted in . For example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated counter clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . The medial surface can be constructed of layers of an orthotropic laminate with fibers similarly rotated counter clockwise with respect to the blade axis from the view depicted in . According to an example the fibers of the orthotropic laminate can be rotated counter clockwise between 0 and 45 with respect to the blade axis . Thus the fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the lateral surface can be oriented in a substantially similar direction as compared to fibers of the orthotropic laminate on the medial surface .

Accordingly when the vertical axis wind turbine blade bends towards the tower the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and above the strut can cause the nose to be pitched inwards and the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and below the strut can cause the nose to be pitched inwards. When the vertical axis wind turbine blade bends away from the tower the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and above the strut can cause the nose to be pitched outwards and the fibers of the orthotropic laminates and below the strut can cause the nose to be pitched outwards. Thus similar to the bend twist coupled U shaped vertical axis wind turbine of the vertical axis turbine blades of the bend twist coupled H shaped vertical axis wind turbine of can twist into an inflow direction when the blades are aerodynamically loaded. Further the blades can bend due to centrifugal forces as the rate of rotation increases which can cause lateral surfaces of the blade to have an increasing amount of static twist which can increase drag over the entire rotation e.g. providing passive speed limitation for overspeed control .
