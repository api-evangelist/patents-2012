title: Method and system for multi-factor biometric authentication
abstract: An approach for enabling multi-factor biometric authentication of a user of a mobile device is described. A biometric authenticator captures, via a mobile device, first and second biometric data for a user. The biometric authentication further associates the first biometric data and the second biometric data. The biometric authenticator then initiates a multi-factor authentication procedure that utilizes the first biometric data and the second biometric data to authenticate the user based on the association.

Service providers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of security services e.g. for performing strong authentication of mobile device users based on the capture and analysis of biometric data. Unfortunately biometric authentication may require significant computing and network resources e.g. storage processing etc. and thus are not suitable for mobile applications. This resource issue is even more problematic if more sophisticated biometric authentication schemes are to be utilized.

Based on the foregoing there is a need for enabling effective use of biometric data to provide security for user devices.

An apparatus method and software for enabling multi factor biometric authentication of a user of a mobile device are described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Resources subject to or associated with the authentication procedure may involve a user device e.g. a server workstation mobile device data store . Other resources may include an application or service e.g. web service a security system of a facility e.g. building automated teller machine ATM or the like. The procedure provides multi factor biometric authentication wherein multiple different biometric data types are relied upon for fulfilling an authentication scheme.

For the purpose of explanation biometric authentication pertains to various methods for granting access use allocation and or entry to a resource based on the authentication of intrinsic physical or behavioral traits of a requesting person user . Biometric identifiers traits include the distinctive measurable physiological and or behavioral characteristics of the user that enable the repeat distinguishing of one user from another. Physiological characteristics are related to the user s body and may include fingerprint data facial data voice physiology hand geometry retinal geometry or odor scent information. Behavioral characteristics are related to the behavior of the user including but not limited to typing rhythm gait and voice data e.g. a voice print inflection patterns speech patterns .

Traditionally various applications employ the use of voice recognition or face recognition technology as a means of distinguishing the unique characteristics of different users. However conventional systems do not adequately perform biometric authentication based on the concurrent capture and processing of multiple different characteristics of a user.

To address this issue a biometric authenticator is configured to operate in connection with e.g. the user device e.g. a mobile device and or various resources to permit the gathering and processing of multiple different types of biometric data. This can include for example the gathering of voice data representing the user s utterance or voice characteristics concurrent with the gathering of video data of the user s facial characteristics. Also other forms of biometric data including iris data retinal data vein data and fingerprint data may also be gathered and processed. Hence the biometric authenticator enables multiple different biometric factors to be captured and analyzed for correlating a user s facial expressions coupled with the user s speech vocal expressions.

In certain embodiments the data is gathered in connection with an enrollment procedure or authentication procedure of the biometric authenticator . For these procedures the biometric authenticator employs various sensors of a user device to facilitate the gathering of voice and facial characteristics of the user. In certain embodiments the authentication procedure is employed in connection with a resource allocation access usage or entry scheme while enrollment is performed to facilitate user biometric intelligence gathering.

The enrollment procedure in some embodiments enables a user to provide baseline biometric data related to the user e.g. a biometric profile . Biometric data as generated may include a combination of specific data points for uniquely identifying a user s physical physiological and or behavioral characteristics. For the purpose of illustration the biometric data may be equivalent to any captured voice face fingerprint iris retinal vein and other data collected in relation to a particular user. Alternatively the biometric data include only a subset of the collected data the subset representing data for indicating only specific points of distinction for a given subject e.g. a user .

The enrollment procedure may include for example one or more instructions to be carried out by the user involving the capturing of physical physiological and behavioral characteristics. In certain embodiments the user performs enrollment during an initial registration process with the biometric authenticator or at a later time. In other instances enrollment may be performed on demand such as to accommodate different resource access or authentication schemes. For example the user may be required to perform on demand or successive enrollment scenarios in order to gain higher levels of access to a particular resource. It is noted therefore depending on the authentication scheme that the enrollment process can be prompted by the resource to be accessed or activated by the user directly e.g. via a user interface for interacting with the biometric authenticator . Alternatively the biometric authenticator may prompt the user to execute enrollment upon determining no existing or up to date biometric data is available or a greater level of authentication authorization is required for the user.

Any device having the required external and or internal sensors e.g. camera and voice recorder can be employed by the biometric authenticator to conduct enrollment. Under this scenario enrollment is performed via the user device or a different user device such as the user s desktop computer network camera or a workstation featuring camera video capture and audio capture capabilities. By virtue of gathering multiple types of data related to the user enrollment is performed in a manner similar to a video chat session wherein the user looks into the camera while speaking into the microphone. The enrollment procedure may correspond to a set of default instructions and protocols or be defined according to instructions and protocols established by the facilitator and or provider of the various resources to be allocated accessed used and or entered. Such instructions and protocols are defined by way of one or more resource policies

In certain embodiments the biometric authenticator prompts the user to verbally and physically respond to various questions commands and or tasks during enrollment. For example a message may be presented to a user interface to prompt the user to utter a word a phrase a series of digits from 0 9 or specifically the entire range of digits from 0 9 a specific term etc. As another example the user may be prompted to alter the angle of image capture or device orientation as they recite a specific phrase or to adapt the position of the camera as the user speaks e.g. capture specific aspects of their face capture a profile view . The user may also be prompted to perform various conditional enrollment scenarios. For example the user may be required to recite a phrase while looking into a camera sensor under a low lighting environmental condition. Under this scenario a lighting source can be provided by the capture device the mobile device etc. It is contemplated that the mobile device may be operated in a flashlight mode wherein the device display is caused to emit a high intensity white light for illuminating the face of the user as the user faces the screen camera. During this mode the specific commands and or questions pursuant to the enrollment procedure may still be rendered to the screen as black colored characters lettering or another contrasting color. Resultantly biometric data is compiled for supporting authentication of a user when they are in a low or no lighting environment i.e. accessing a security gate in the evening. Additionally other types of light may be used in connection with the user biometric processes. For example an infrared light source may be provided by the capture device for enabling the capture of retina biometric.

In other conditional enrollment scenarios the user may be prompted to capture a video of the user s eye s from close range or may be required to position the eye s for performance of an iris or retinal scan. This may be performed in conjunction with a capture of voice data recited by the user. Additionally a user may enroll a specific pose e.g. Big Smile or SERIOUS . As yet another conditional enrollment scenario the user may be required to adjust or modify various facial adornments or characteristics for enabling compilation of different biometric profile data. For example a capturing of the face during enrollment with and without eyeglasses with and without facial hair etc.

The user recognition process and subsequently the biometric data set associated with the user is facilitated in part by capturing the user response to specific phrases during facial characteristic data capture. Hence by capturing various facial gestures mannerisms and expressions in association with data for indicating user voice inflection intonation sound rhythmic patterns etc. the data recognition accuracy of the biometric authenticator is enhanced. Also the biometric data set for a particular user is more comprehensive and fine tuned by virtue of conditional enrollment. Additionally user biometric data can be refined as more data is capture with additional system usage by the user.

It is noted that the above described approach is in contrast to performing user recognition based on a static image of the user s face. The static image approach results in a narrow or limited biometric data set which does not fully account for the different characteristics mannerisms or conditional factors that enhance biometric authentication. The biometric data captured by way of the multi factor enrollment process described above is then stored in connection with profile information not shown for the user. By way of this approach the biometric data for the user establishes a unique biometric signature profile fingerprint etc. for enabling subsequent reference and or identification of the user. It is noted therefore that the biometric data related to the user includes face and voice biometric baseline data as well as corresponding movement data related to the user. Further details of the enrollment procedure are described with respect to and .

In one embodiment an authentication procedure is also performed by the biometric authenticator i.e. based on the biometric data captured during enrollment. The authentication procedure may be defined according to instructions and protocols established by the facilitator and or provider of the various resources to be allocated accessed used or entered. As mentioned previously such protocols are set forth via one or more resource policies . It is noted therefore that the authentication procedure can be performed in connection with a security scheme resource access or allocation scheme provisioning scheme or any other scheme as an intermediate or integral authentication process related to a particular resource. The scheme may be customized accordingly for enabling a user to perform biometric authentication with respect to different types locations and requirements of resources.

For the purpose of illustration the biometric authenticator may be employed in connection with a secured access scheme for an application or service made available by a provider. In this scenario the resource can be limited to being accessed only by those users whose voice and or face or other biometric information may be authenticated as a result of performing a biometric analysis. Per the resource polices established by the provider of the resource the user may be prompted to respond to one or a series of authentication questions challenges commands or tasks by way of their user device . The response provided by the user is captured via one or more sensors of the device for compiling a set of voice video or other data e.g. still image data by way of an infrared light source referred to herein as a response input.

In certain embodiments the biometric authenticator may generate a message at the user interface of the device for requesting the user to provide biometric data response input per an authentication process. The message may be a request for the user to utter a security code or password perform a specific facial gesture repeat a phrase or random string of digits vary the angle of image capture or orientation of the device perform a series of movements about the user s face or a combination thereof. Alternatively the user may be presented with a knowledge based authentication challenge e.g. recite their employee user identifier . In one embodiment the biometric data provided as response input is gathered by the sensors of the user s device and provided to the biometric authenticator for analysis. Under this scenario the biometric authentication procedure can be facilitated via any device available to the user for interacting with or accessing a given resource. Authentication is not limited to being performed at a dedicated location or by a dedicated device any mobile device or location may suffice for enabling the authentication process to commence as long as the resource policies for the resource in question are honored.

Once the response input biometric data is gathered e.g. voice and facial expression data the biometric authenticator analyzes such data using various data recognition techniques. For example the biometric authenticator employs image facial and voice recognition for correlating the biometric data provided by the user with the biometric data gathered during enrollment. Hence the correlation is based on a comparing and or recognizing of a first and second set of biometric data. When a match is found to within a predetermined threshold the corresponding user profile associated with the biometric data is also determined accordingly.

Once the match is determined the authentication procedure is flagged as complete. Alternatively the biometric authenticator can return a biometric authentication confidence score e.g. 90 confidence to an application and allow the application to make the biometric authentication pass or fail judgment. Hence access to allocation of use of or entry into the resource is therefore granted accordingly based on the determined rights of the user a level score of confidence etc. Alternatively a subsequent procedure of the comprehensive resource access and or authentication scheme is carried out. When no match is determined however the authentication procedure is flagged as incomplete. Consequently access to allocation of use of or entry to the resource associated with the multi factor biometric authentication procedure is restricted as well as the execution of any subsequent procedures.

In certain embodiments the biometric authenticator may maintains log data for logging details regarding one or more successful and failed biometric authentication sessions or attempts. These details may include for example a date of session establishment or attempt thereof a number of successful or unsuccessful attempts time duration of access to a resource or session length etc. The log data may be retrieved for enabling non repudiation and accountability of biometric authentication transactions. It is important that we only use the term recording as intended for example the recording of biometric and communication data stored in Log Data and available to support later data analysis including statistics and information accountability auditing.

It is contemplated in certain embodiments that various recognition schemes may be used in combination for interpreting the multiple different types of biometric data provided as response input against the biometric data gathered during enrollment. It is further contemplated that the recognition may be performed in connection with specific pattern and motion recognition techniques for enabling the biometric authenticator to recognize various bodily gestures and motions unique to the user. The authentication may therefore be predicated upon analysis of voice and facial characteristics of the user in conjunction with a predetermined motion or gesture e.g. a secret facial expression or a specific sequence of facial features .

For the purposes of illustration the analysis e.g. recognition and matching performed by the biometric authenticator may be based on the biometric data collected during the authentication procedure or portions thereof. By way of example when the biometric data provided as response input during authentication is recorded specific portions of the collected data may be compared to the biometric data captured during enrollment. Alternatively the entire captured response may be subject to comparison. Any approach or processing technique is within the scope of the exemplary embodiments presented herein. Furthermore it is noted that the biometric authenticator may support parallel and or distributed processing of collected data for rendering an authentication result. For example a basic processing e.g. general determination that the data corresponds to a face versus another part of the body of the collected data may be analyzed via the biometric authenticator at the device while more complex analysis is performed by a network accessible service module of the biometric authenticator .

Further the user device may perform initial coarse grain biometric authentication confidence score generation. Under this scenario the biometric data is forked via a network to one or more processing resources e.g. service provider where fine grained biometric authentication confidence scores are generated. By way of example a HTML5 browser session on the user device uses the camera and microphone to gather biometric data then forks this data for concurrent local and external processing. Local processing on user device generates coarse biometric authentication scores e.g. based on coarse face e.g. limited number of points measured a limited number of times iris and voice data. Concurrently the forked video and audio data is used along with additional context information to progressively generate fine grain biometric authentication scores based on fine face e.g. several points measured several times vein and voice data using large scale computing resources e.g. in service provider network . An application then uses the coarse and fine grained biometric authentication confidence scores to progressively calculate combined confidence for evaluating user authorization decisions. It is noted that the biometric authenticator may be configured to accommodate different processing arrangements accordingly.

In certain embodiments the authentication result may be dependent on the processing of context information conveyed to the biometric authenticator at the moment of response input data capture. The context information may include for example location information temporal information network information position information and other data collected by a context module of a device . The context module conveys this information to the biometric authenticator which stores the data accordingly. Under this scenario authentication may include validating of a location condition time condition or other factor in addition to the biometric analysis. Conditional requirements may be specified per the resource policies defined for the resource in question. It is noted that processing of the context information in near real time concurrent with biometric analysis facilitates more advanced authentication procedures to be executed in connection with a resource or other activity requiring authentication and or authorization.

By way of example a time condition may be required to be fulfilled to permit the opening of an automated security gate featured at the entrance of a data storage facility. In this case the biometric authenticator accesses various resource policies for supporting interaction between the user the user device and the security gate. The user device may include for example a dedicated application for enabling communication exchange between the user device and the security gate. Alternatively the application may be a browser application or other portal through which the various authentication questions tasks and or commands required for access of the resource may be presented.

A first user may have twenty four hour access to the data storage facility by virtue of access rights afforded them by the resource provider. The authentication of the user s biometric data which includes voice and facial expressions thus permits the gate to open at any time of the day. In contrast a second user may only be granted access to the facility during normal business hours. As a result successful processing of the biometric data during authentication is not sufficient in and of itself to permit entry to the facility when the current time is beyond business hours. It is noted that additional conditions for successful authentication may be further established including conditions for specifying which rooms equipment or other resources may be accessed by the user once they are within the facility. Additionally access to other systems such as automated teller machines ATMs can be similarly authenticated and or authorized.

As another example a just in time JIT authentication procedure may be carried out based on the fulfillment of one or more conditions being met per the resource policies . JIT authentication may include for example triggering of the authentication procedure only when a specified contextual condition is determined. For instance when it is determined a user is attempting to access a device or device for performing a low priority transaction the biometric authenticator may enable the user to bypass some steps of the authentication procedure. In contrast when it is determined the user is attempting to perform a high priority transaction e.g. a financial transaction the biometric authenticator may prompt the user to proceed with the authentication instructions commands and or questions. In this example the determined priority level of the transaction the type of activity being performed and or the type of resource triggers the authentication procedure in time for enabling access use allocation or entry of the resource accordingly. It is noted that the context information as gathered via the context module may also include activity and or transaction information related to the user the user device or a combination thereof. Context data can be stored on the user device in a service provider network or a combination of both.

In yet another example the biometric authenticator may be configured to perform continual authentication of a user in connection with a resource. Continual authentication may include for example triggering of subsequent authentication procedures beyond initial authentication of the user. By way of example a user granted access to a proprietary server after successful completion of an initial authentication may be required to perform the authentication procedure every x minutes thereafter. Under this scenario access to the resource is revoked or interrupted unless the subsequent authentication procedure is carried out. Still further the subsequent authentication procedure may be the same as the initial authentication procedure thus requiring the user to provide the same biometric data as a response input in. Alternatively the user may be required to execute different questions tasks and or commands for recording of biometric data. Thus for the latter the user is prompted to provide a different security passcode or identifier for attaining successively higher levels of authentication with respect to a resource. User biometric data processing can also be performed passively. For example voice and facial biometric data may be captured as the user speaks during a video chat on their mobile phone. It is noted that the subsequent authentication procedures may also correspond to one or more additional enrollment procedures.

In certain embodiments the rights of the user regarding various resources may be specified in association with their user profile information. A manager or provider of the resource may establish the access rights. These rights may be further maintained and executed in accordance with the biometric authenticator per the one or more resource policies . Hence it is noted that the resource policies may define the access rights and privileges of various users and or user device for accessing a resource the one or more authentication protocols and procedures to be carried out e.g. the required set of authentication questions to be answered and or responded to by the user contextual conditions to be fulfilled etc. In addition the resource policies may define the order of execution of one or more authentication procedures to be performed with respect to a given resource.

Similar to the enrollment process the authentication procedure may be performed in a manner similar to a voice chat session. Under this scenario the user looks into the camera and speaks into the microphone of their user device simultaneously for supporting the capture of user response input e.g. voice and facial data to be used in connection with an authentication request.

Also the authentication procedure may be invoked on demand such as when the user travels from the location of one resource to another. By way of example device interaction for triggering authentication may be facilitated via wireless link detection e.g. Bluetooth near field communication NFC Zigbee Z Wave or a network connection between the resource to be accessed and the user device . An application at the user device may facilitate the communication process such as in response to a user request. Alternatively the process may be triggered in response to a proximity presence condition being fulfilled. It is noted that identifying information such as a device identifier may be exchanged during communication between the resource and the user device for enabling the authentication procedure to commence.

In certain embodiments the biometric authenticator may be offered by a service provider as a managed or hosted solution e.g. as a cloud based service as an integrated component of the user device or a combination thereof. By way of example the user device may interact with the biometric authenticator via a network . Under this scenario the various data processing recognition and biometric analysis functions described herein are performed independent of the device . Resultantly any sensor data and context information gathered by the device via sensors or context module is transmitted to the biometric authenticator . Results from processing of the data it then returned pushed to back the user device

In the case of direct integration of the biometric authenticator the various data processing recognition and biometric analysis functions described herein are performed at the device . For example the biometric authenticator may be implemented in a chip set with specific input output sequences for use in connection with the operating system of the device the application or a combination thereof. Under this scenario the biometric authenticator directly controls the operation of the sensors and context module for receiving voice face and context related data. In certain embodiments the biometric authenticator may also distribute the processing such that certain tasks are performed at the device while others are performed via a hosted solution.

It is noted that user devices may be any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer Personal Digital Assistants PDAs smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the user devices can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchange of data. In addition user devices may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information including touch screen capability keyboard and keypad data entry video gesture recognition voice based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices are applicable.

It is also noted with respect to that user device can be a server workstation desktop computer security system ATM wireless node network adapter or any other standalone or integrated system comprising a collection of resources. In this scenario a resource in the form of a user device is different in arrangement and or configuration than user device and therefore may not include the various components and as employed via user device . The user device may also not feature an application .

In certain embodiments user device the biometric authenticator resources and other elements of system may be configured to communicate via a service provider network . According to certain embodiments one or more networks such as data network telephony network and or wireless network can interact with the service provider network . Networks may be any suitable wireline and or wireless network and be managed by one or more service providers. For example telephony network may include a circuit switched network such as the public switched telephone network PSTN an integrated services digital network ISDN a private branch exchange PBX or other like network.

Networks may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including for example code division multiple access CDMA long term evolution LTE enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS mobile ad hoc network MANET global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like. Meanwhile data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN the Internet or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network such as a proprietary cable or fiber optic network.

Still further the communication provider network may embody circuit switched and or packet switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit switched and or packet based communications. It is further contemplated that networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner the communication networks may support embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 SS7 network Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.

It is noted though not shown in the figure that in certain embodiments user devices may be configured to establish peer to peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies near field communication NFC Bluetooth ZigBee Z Wave infrared etc. Also connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network LAN . By way of example a group of user devices may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to dynamically assign private DHCP internet protocol IP addresses to each user device i.e. IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network as facilitated via a router. Network address translation NAT can also be used to protect the details and configuration of the underlying network topology from becoming known.

In addition the biometric authenticator also maintains various databases for storing context information pertaining to users biometric data as generated for users resource policies log data and profile information pertaining to users or optionally resource providers . It is noted that modules access several of these databases for performing their respective functions.

In one embodiment a registration module registers users and user devices e.g. a mobile device for interaction with the biometric authenticator . By way of example the registration module receives a request to subscribe to the biometric authenticator for enabling multi factor biometric authentication of a subscribing user. The subscription process may include the generating of enrollment data for use in creating biometric data performed in conjunction with the enrollment module . The registration may be performed by way of a user interface generated by the user interface module . In addition the registration process may include the selection of various resources the user wants access to. The resources are themselves registered with the biometric authenticator and specified by one or more resource policies . As noted the resource policies also indicate various access rights for a particular user with respect to the resources. Preferences and settings information may be referenced to a specific user user device or combination thereof and maintained in connection with profile information .

The registration process performed by the module may also include receiving and validating a login name and or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user during a subscription registration process with provider of the biometric authenticator . The login process may also be performed in response to an access attempt or exchange between a user device and a desired resource. In certain embodiments the access attempt is facilitated by the detection module and is triggered in response to a proximity condition being met between the user device and the resource e.g. via a wireless link . The login name and or user identifier value may be received as input provided by the user from the user device or other device via a graphical user interface to the biometric authenticator e.g. as enabled by the user interface module . Profile information for respective subscribers which contains pertinent user or device profile data may be cross referenced as part of the login or access process. Alternatively the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as profile information with an IP address a carrier detection signal of a user device mobile directory number MDN subscriber identity module SIM e.g. of a SIM card radio frequency identifier RFID tag or other identifier.

By way of example the detection module triggers the enrollment or authentication process in response to the user device approaching the location of a resource. Under this scenario the detection module operates in connection with the communication interface for transmitting as well as detecting wireless signals to and from a given resource. The signal may include identification information which upon detection alerts the registration module enrollment module or authentication module of the availability and proximity of a resource. It is noted that the detection module may also be configured to restrict the detecting of resources of which the user has no association i.e. no resource policies are associated with the user for that specific resource.

In certain embodiments the enrollment module facilitates an enrollment procedure. As noted the enrollment procedure may be performed in conjunction with the registration process facilitated by the registration module . For enrollment purposes the enrollment module controls the various sensors of the user device. In the case of a smartphone for example the enrollment module generates a signal for accessing the front facing camera microphone or other integral sensors. Once complete the enrollment module relinquishes control of the various sensors . It is noted that any device having sensors for capturing biometric data related to the voice and facial expressions of the user are subject to control of the enrollment module as initiated by the user or via a proximity condition being met. Also it is noted that the enrollment module facilitates execution of the various sensors in conjunction with an application at the device. For instance the application may be a dedicated application for interfacing with a specific resource e.g. a security gate application provided by the resource provider an ATM access security application .

The enrollment module facilitates the enrollment process via one or more resource policies . According to one embodiment enrollment module is configured to seed the enrollment from previously captured validated data pertaining to the user e.g. voice recordings videos pictures of the user . As such the module can provide an initial baseline of biometric data without requiring direct user interaction. This automated baseline can then be improved upon by subsequent active or passive biometric data capture and analysis. The policies correspond to a series of commands questions and or tasks to be fulfilled by the user for enabling the gathering of biometric data. As noted previously multiple types of biometric data related to the user are gathered simultaneously such as in a manner similar to a video chat session. Hence the enrollment module instructs the user to look into a camera sensor and speak into a microphone simultaneously as the user complies with or responds to a set of default instructions and protocols comprising the enrollment procedure. It is noted that the sensors may be used to detect the position and or presence of a face within view of the camera e.g. based on a standard facial template the sound of a voice etc.

It is noted that the storing of biometric data during enrollment per step may include linking the data to user profile information . In addition enrollment completion per step includes generation of a composite set of biometric data for the user that includes both face and voice baseline data. The enrollment module may employ various biometric analysis and generation techniques accordingly. In certain embodiments the biometric data may also be used for performing voice and facial data result extrapolation wherein the composite set of data is sufficient to support deterministic analysis. Deterministic analysis includes any methods and procedures for employing baseline voice and facial expression data of the user to determine or estimate a voice or facial result. For example video data featuring the user s face from a profile perspective may still be correlated with the front facing data gathered during the enrollment process. As another example voice data provided by the user as input that does not directly correspond to voice data captured during enrollment may be extrapolated e.g. baseline inflection pitch tone for enabling sufficient recognition of the user.

In one embodiment the recognition engine employs various data recognition techniques for analyzing biometric data. This includes for example voice recognition image and video recognition iris recognition vein recognition motion analysis and the like. The recognition engine also employs facial characteristic analysis. Any known and still developing protocols and algorithms may be employed. The recognition engine processes the data in order to determine a correlation with known biometric data pertaining to the user e.g. as generated during enrollment . It is contemplated in certain embodiments that the aforementioned recognition approaches may be used in combination for interpreting the multiple different types of biometric data. It is further contemplated that the motion recognition techniques may be employed for determining user fulfillment of a predetermined motion or gesture e.g. a secret facial expression or a specific sequence of facial features or various user mannerisms.

In one embodiment the context processing module receives context information as gathered by the user device subject to the authentication procedure. Once received the context processing module analyzes the context information provided by the context module . The data is processed according to the sensor type i.e. if the sensor is a network detection sensor it processes and interprets the network data e.g. internet protocol address information . Likewise if the sensor is a global positioning sensor the module interprets the gathered data as location and or geo spatial data. Of note the context processing module may operate in connection with the detection module for responding to determined proximity conditions.

In one embodiment the authentication module enables the authentication process to be carried out for enabling user access use entry or allocation of a resource. Authentication is performed based on the data captured during the enrollment process by the enrollment module . The authentication module prompts the user to respond to a one or more authentication questions commands or tasks specific to authenticating the user. The response provided by the user as biometric data is then captured via one or more sensors of the device . The capture may include the compiling of audio and video data. It is noted that the authentication module may also control the various sensors of a given device during the authentication process. Also of note the various instructions and protocols defining the procedure are processed by the authentication module via one or more resource policies

It is noted that the authentication module may be configured to perform online and or offline processing of biometric data provided by a user for enabling biometric analysis. For example in certain implementations the authentication module may perform baseline analysis of biometric data in conjunction with the recognition engine at the device. Concurrent with this execution more advanced or refined biometric analysis may be performed via a remote analytics service that is accessible via the communication interface . Under this scenario the analytics service processes the response input e.g. face and voice data using various advanced algorithms then returns the processing result to the authentication module .

In one embodiment the user interface module enables presentment of a graphical user interface for enabling user enrollment and authentication to be performed. By way of example the user interface module generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces APIs or other function calls corresponding to the browser application or web portal application of the user devices thus enabling the display of graphics primitives. Of note the user interface module may operate in connection with the authentication module and enrollment module accordingly. The detection module may also employ the user interface module for alerting a user of the presence of a resource. It is noted that the user interface module may coincide with a browser application dedicated application or other interface based software operable at a user device subject to the authentication procedure.

In one embodiment a communication interface enables formation of a session over a network between the biometric authenticator and the resources. By way of example the communication interface executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a subscriber s user device e.g. mobile devices laptops smartphones tablet computers desktop computers servers workstations and the biometric authenticator over the network . It is noted that the communication interface is also configured to support a browser session i.e. the retrieval of content as referenced by a resource identifier during a specific period of time or usage of the browser.

The above presented modules and components of the biometric authenticator can be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Furthermore various of the modules may record log data for supporting subsequent data analysis. Though depicted as a separate entity in it is contemplated that the biometric authenticator may be implemented for direct operation by respective user devices . As such the biometric authenticator may generate direct signal inputs by way of the operating system of the user device for interacting with the resources or the application . In another embodiment one or more of the modules may be implemented for operation by respective user devices as a platform hosted solution cloud based service or the like. Under this scenario a biometric authenticator as a service access model may be employed such as in connection with a mobile device module a software development kit SDK and corresponding Service Provider Network processing scheme. As such various application developers may incorporate multi factor biometric authentication seamlessly within their applications and or processing schemes. It is noted that the various modules may be used selectively or in combination within the context of a resource allocation or access scheme.

In step of process the biometric authenticator captures via the mobile device a first biometric data for the user. The biometric authenticator further captures via the mobile device a second biometric data for the user per step . By way of example the first biometric data may include data pertaining to various facial expressions while the second may include iris retinal vein or voice data for the user. As noted previously the first and second biometric data as captured and recorded via one or more sensors may be acquired concurrently as part of a multi factor authentication procedure.

In steps and the biometric authenticator associates the first and second biometric data and initiates a multi factor authentication procedure that utilizes the first biometric data and the second biometric data to authenticate the user based on the association. As mentioned previously the biometric authenticator associates any voice data video data iris data retinal data vein data fingerprint data or the like as captured with the baseline biometric data pertaining to the user. The baseline biometric data includes that generated during the enrollment process or created from previously captured and validated user data. This pertains to the seeding scheme as previously described. Per step the biometric authenticator initiates a multi factor authentication procedure that utilizes the first biometric data and the second biometric data to authenticate the user based on the association. As noted previously the authentication may be part of a secured data access scheme resource allocation scheme or the like.

In step of process the biometric authenticator generates a message at the mobile device for requesting the user to respond to a command a question or a combination thereof. The first biometric data and the second biometric data are based on the response to the command and or question. Responses may include for example a password a user identifier an answer to a challenge question a phrase a facial expression a bodily feature a sequence of movements of the mobile device or a combination thereof. Per step the biometric authenticator determines a correlation between the first biometric data and the second biometric data based on voice recognition facial recognition fingerprint recognition iris analysis retinal analysis vein analysis or a combination thereof. As noted the recognition and analysis may be performed at the mobile device by a network service or cloud based solution or in a distributed manner wherein processing is shared among the device and the service. It is noted in the case of voice recognition that liveness information can be calculated as a means of identifying recordings.

In step the biometric authenticator determines the rights of the user based on the association between the first and second biometric data for the user. The rights can correspond to a level of access use entry or allocation of a resource associated with the multi factor authentication procedure. The user may have a different set of rights associated with one resource versus another. Alternatively the biometric authenticator determines a user authentication confidence score that may be used to authorize a transaction authorize access to resources access to a facility provided to another application or service for authorization determination etc.

In step the biometric authenticator determines context information related to the mobile device. In certain embodiments context information related to the user and or resource to be accessed may also be determined. The context information may include for example location information a mobile device identifier a resource identifier time information network information or a combination thereof. Per step the biometric authenticator determines whether the context information matches one or more criteria associated with the multi factor authentication procedure. By way of example location information as captured may be used determine if a proximity condition is met between the mobile device and the resource.

Of note the biometric authenticator may also determines transmission of an authentication request by the mobile device and or the resource. The authentication request is transmitted based on context information related to the mobile device context information related to the resource a user input at the mobile device or a combination thereof. The context information relates to the use case where a location proximity condition is fulfilled between the mobile device and the resource to trigger initiation of the authentication. In this case presence detection triggers the authentication process. Additional context information including locomotion i.e. user movement direction speed mobile device radio connectivity and signal strength user s previous location e.g. where they traveled from etc. may also be leveraged in connection with the authentication. Alternatively the user may invoke the authentication via a dedicated application at the mobile device e.g. an application designed specifically for a given resource . In an exemplary embodiment biometric authenticator can be provided as a service e.g. with a mobile device module SDK software development kit and corresponding service provider network based processing. One advantage of this approach is that application developers can readily incorporate multi factor biometric authentication seamlessly within their applications thereby providing a good user experience.

In the user initiates the enrollment process by way of an application at their mobile device . The application may execute instructions for enabling it to interface with the biometric authenticator via a network wireless link or through direct device control means. Also the application may be a browser e.g. Hyper Text Mark up Language HTML or web portal tool capable of interfacing with the biometric authenticator via a communication network. Under this scenario the biometric authenticator initiates the gathering of a first set of biometric data. As such the application is caused to render various commands questions and or task requests to a user interface of the device for execution of the enrollment process. In certain embodiments it is contemplated that the application causes rendering of the various commands questions and or task requests at the time of device activation e.g. when the phone is switched on .

In an instruction is rendered to the user interface for requesting the user to face into a camera of the device such that an image of their face is shown within a designated viewing area . Alternatively the biometric authentication request may be automatically initiated such as in response to the opening or activating of the mobile device. Under this scenario no instruction need be rendered to the user interface . In response to the authentication request the user may adjust the orientation and or position of the mobile device for complying with this request i.e. to adjust the depth of the camera lens accordingly. One or more algorithms may be employed by the biometric authenticator for detecting that a face is within view.

In addition to facing the camera the user is also presented with an instruction to recite all the digits ranging from 0 to 9 as shown in . Alternatively as an additional enrollment requirement the instruction may be for the user to recite various random digits as shown in . The user recites the digits while simultaneously facing the camera of the device . In the recitation is depicted as transmission of an audio signal sound from the user s mouth. As a result biometric data is captured accordingly and the user interface renders a status message for indicating enrollment is underway. A microphone icon is also presented to the user interface for indicating an audio signal is currently being detected and recorded per the enrollment procedure. Alternatively the icon may be a video camera icon for indicating video footage of the user is being captured per the enrollment process. While not shown additional instructions and or commands relative to the authentication procedure may be presented to the user interface accordingly including those instructions pertaining to the capture of retinal iris or vein characteristics.

Once the user responds to all of the questions and the biometric data is recorded an enrollment completion message is rendered to the user interface . In addition to specifying completion of the enrollment process the message includes a graphic depicting the user s face as well as an icon depicting an audio signal. The graphic and icon and respectively are representative of the multiple different types of biometric data captured via enrollment i.e. for use in generating a baseline biometric profile of the user. In certain embodiments user profile information regarding the user is also presented for specifying the user to which the biometric data correlates.

In an instruction is presented to the user for performing a biometric authentication. By way of example the user is presented with an instruction and or command challenge to speak a two digit phrase while facing the camera of the mobile device . A status message for indicating the verification process is underway as the user speaks is presented to the display . It is noted that the verification procedure may be performed in connection with the enrollment process as an additional means of verifying the enrollment. In this way subsequent attempts at biometric authentication for the user in connection with a resource may be adequately performed.

In as the user approaches the security gate the controller transmits a notification signal for indicating the specific resource e.g. the data center is within proximity of the device . It is noted that the notification signal may convey an identifier or other credentials which are cross referenced by the biometric authenticator for determining user association with the resource. This may include for example retrieving various resource policies established by the provider of the data center the policies including details regarding the user s access rights or level thereof with respect to the data center authentication procedure to be performed etc. In this scenario once the signal is processed a welcome message is rendered to the display of the mobile device . Alternatively the welcome message may be rendered as an audio message such as via the device speakers.

In the authentication procedure continues with the biometric authenticator rendering a security and or authentication command to the user interface . The command is a request for the user to utter their identifier e.g. employee identifier guest identifier security identifier for capture by a microphone of the mobile device . The authentication procedure also calls for the user to face into the camera of the mobile device such that their face is shown within a viewing area . Alternatively the user may face into the camera associated with the resource they are attempting to access such as the camera of an automated teller machine or at a security gate. Once the user begins speaking the biometric authenticator captures the biometric data as response input.

As noted previously the command presented to the user interface in could also be rendered in audio form. For example the biometric authenticator may generate a voice command of the request for the user to utter their identifier. Under this scenario the command as rendered to the user interface need not be shown. The user would respond to the voice command while facing the camera of the device then enabling capture of biometric data for comparison against other biometric data for the user.

Once a response input in the form of voice and face data is provided the biometric authenticator analyzes the input using various data recognition techniques and algorithms for determining a correlation between the biometric data as captured during authentication against the biometric data compiled during enrollment or user biometric baseline data created from user data e.g. in relation to the seeded biometric baseline data . During this time a status message is rendered to the user interface for indicating the authentication process is underway. As noted the recognition schemes may include voice facial and motion recognition.

In addition to capturing biometric data related to the user s voice and face as the user recites the identifier the authentication procedure further requires the user to perform one or more authentication gestures or motions. Under this scenario as shown in the user is required to recite their identifier while adapting the distance D between the camera and the user s face or adjusting the position or motion of the camera. As such the area of focus of the camera upon the face of the user is adapted. Consequently the recorded video data includes face voice and motion data of which the face and voice data is correlated with the biometric data while the motion is correlated with a predetermined secret motion. Alternatively the user may adapt the position of the device including focusing it on a specific portion of the face in a predetermined sequence e.g. left eye nose right eye mouth right ear . Any combination of approaches may be applied in connection with the authentication procedure.

Once the correlation is determined the authentication procedure is deemed complete. Under this scenario an authentication completion message is presented to the user interface as shown in . A portion of the message includes an indication of the specific resource to which the user is being granted access. In response to the authentication the security gate is opened for permitting entry by the user.

It is noted that the authentication completion message may vary depending on the type of scheme for which the authentication is associated the resource type and the rights afforded the user. By way of example in the case of the resource being an application the completion message may indicate Usage Granted or Limited Usage Granted for corresponding with predetermined usage rights afforded the user. As another example in the case of the resource being a network server the completion message may indicate Access Granted or Guest Access Only for corresponding with predetermined access rights afforded the user. As yet another example in the case of an ATM transaction the completion message may indicate Transaction Authorized up to 100 or Transaction Authorized up to 10 000. Of note the rights or score afforded the user may also be executed on a conditional basis thus requiring the processing of context information and or additional biometric processing e.g. performed via the service provider network .

The exemplary techniques and systems presented herein enable multi factor biometric authentication of a user of a mobile device. One advantage of the exemplary techniques and systems presented herein is the ability of the biometric authenticator to enroll both face and voice biometric data during a brief enrollment process e.g. similar to a video chat session . The result is in increased facial recognition accuracy as the nuances of the user s face iris retina veins speech patterns gestures etc. are accounted for. As another advantage the biometric authenticator may also employ the use of context information e.g. location data for enabling authentication. Still further the biometric authenticator enables the generation of random or knowledge based authentication questions and or commands for use in multi factor biometric authentication.

According to certain embodiments the above processes and arrangements advantageously permit enhanced security using a multi factor biometric authentication procedure that for example can be implemented utilizing minimal resources and thus can be suitable for mobile devices.

The processes described herein for enabling multi factor biometric authentication of a user of a mobile device may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for adjusting cursor movement on the display . Alternatively or additionally an infrared light source e.g. for performing retina biometric and or using display as light source can be utilized to illuminate the user for capturing recognition data via camera .

According to an embodiment of the invention the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium or non transitory i.e. non volatile media and volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory .

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC .
