title: Network infrastructure supporting a multi-seller promotion and transaction environment
abstract: An online sales/automatic rebate and coupon redemption system provides online customers automatic retrieval and redemption of all applicable rebates and coupons during purchase. Purchase orders from customers are selectively fulfilled and products are shipped to the customers either by the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption or by other merchant or manufacturer environments. The system purchases from merchants using applicable coupons and rebates and then sells the products to the customers, passing the savings to them. The system makes it possible to automatically retrieve coupons and rebates for items in a shopping cart during the activity of an online purchase at an electronic mall or an online merchant site. The system provides coupons to potential customers via email, based on customer profile, geographical information, etc. Manufacturers and merchants can update coupon value and content based on ongoing sales and volume of customer activity.

The present invention relates generally to online sales and marketing and more specifically to the dispensing of rebates and coupons to customers on the Internet and to the redemption of the rebates and coupons for customers by a system for online sales during online purchase on the Internet.

Coupons have been traditionally dispensed by manufacturers and retailers to customers by means of inserts in newspapers. Some manufacturers also mail coupons to customers. Rebates have traditionally been offered by manufacturers to push the volume of sales of specific products. Such products are typically those for which the manufacturers have excess inventories or those that are being phased out.

Of late Internet based sales have increased in volume. Some manufacturers have made it possible for a potential customer to obtain rebate forms or coupons from their web site. These rebate or coupons can be downloaded and printed by customers to be redeemed in traditional neighborhood stores.

In general there are several problems associated with dispensing and redeeming coupons in online sales and marketing activities. These include the frequent inability of a customer to use a coupon placed by an advertiser or merchant in a newspaper or brochure during the activity of online product purchase due to the remoteness of the merchant or vendor. That is because traditional coupon delivery and redeeming methods do not integrate well with Internet based sales where a customer visits a vendor or merchant s web site rather than a store for purchases. The customer and the vendor are also typically located in different cities and it is not possible to redeem traditional coupons in such a scenario.

These problems are also true for manufacturer s rebates. Such rebates are typically dispensed in traditional neighborhood stores and are to be mailed back to manufacturers with receipts for the related purchases. Customer s seldom redeem them as redemption requires making a photocopy of their receipts and mailing the receipts along with the rebates to the manufacturer and waiting a few weeks for a check from the manufacturer.

Sellers often provide coupons and rebates as an incentive to promote sales of specific products. A manufacturer attempts to identify the amount and quantity of each rebate or coupon and the time period during which such offer will be valid. Such rebates and coupons are typically delivered in a paper form to distributors and retailers. Distributors receiving such rebates and coupons further forward the rebates and coupons to their associated retailers.

To use the rebates and coupons online the retailer often has to modify the product database web server content and possibly its sales application. This burden along with the burden of having to collect from the manufacturer dissuades the retailer from participating in the rebate and coupon process. Without knowing whether or to what extent the retailers will participate a manufacturer may under or overestimate the number or amount of rebates or coupon offerings.

An overestimation may for example cause a manufacturer to over sell a product beyond an inventory. Similarly an underestimation may fail to move an inventory before the value of such inventory plummets. Complicating this problem a manufacturer by law must honor any coupon or rebate once distributed at least for a period of time identified on the rebate or coupon.

In addition to the difficulties associated with integrating rebates and coupons into their online sales systems retailers have monetary disincentives to do so. In particular a retailer typically purchases goods expecting a certain profit margin upon selling such goods. To apply a manufacturer s coupon or rebate at the time of the sale requires the retailer to seek at least a part if not all of their profit from the manufacturer 30 90 days after making the sale.

Some online retailers offer their own coupons and rebates hoping to capture the attention of price conscience buyers. Such online retailers who post their own coupons or rebates are typically suspect in creating a fa ade pricing scheme.

Because retailers have little incentive to provide support for manufacturer s coupons and rebates on line buyers are left with coupon rebate options. In some cases buyers may still use such coupons and rebates but must do so via post snail mail and subsequently receive the redemption value via return post.

After receiving a product if a buyer is interested in redeeming a coupon or rebate and or registering the product for technical support or update reasons the buyer must typically fill out a form which they mail via post to the manufacturer. Upon receipt the manufacturer will have to read the handwriting of the buyer to add the buyer s information from the form to their database. If the good purchased is software only registration information may be gathered during installation. The buyer is still forced to interact with the manufacturer via post for coupons or rebates. The entire process fails if the buyer misplaces the receipt or the coupon or rebate or fails to file the same within a required timeframe. Upon receipt of such information the manufacturer must determine whether or not to honor a coupon or rebate. To do so they must determine whether the coupon or rebate applies to a specific good that has been sold to the specific buyer. Because this process is difficult it is not only time consuming but is also subject to fraud. Such fraud may involve a purported buyer operating independently a buyer and retailer operating together or a retailer operating independently.

To combat fraud manufacturers apply complicated approaches to attempt to link the coupon or rebate to the specific good often confusing and disappointing buyers and retailers. For example a fifteen digit model number may appear to correspond to a coupon being offered and causing a sale even though one digit may be off and only identified after a manufacturer s rejection has been received. If this happens to a retailer the retailer may lose money on the sale of the item. If it happens to the buyer the buyer may be angry with the retailer and or the manufacturer and avoid their businesses in the future.

With large distributed channels manufacturers typically do not know the identity of their retailers. This further complicates the rollout of coupon or rebate offering.

Many other problems and disadvantages associated with prior systems will become apparent to one of skill in the art upon review of such prior systems and in light of the teachings herein.

A system and or method is provided for an online promotion system supporting buyers sellers and promoters substantially as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures as set forth more completely in the claims.

Many other aspects and variations of the promotion system of the present invention can be appreciated by one of skill in the art through review of the detailed description corresponding drawings and claims.

The system performs many functions. Among other functions in many embodiments the system 1 verifies that a manufacturer s rebate or coupon applies to an independent retailer s offering 2 instantly applies such rebates or coupons 3 places control in the manufacturer for designing and defining the number amount and if desired applicable timeframe of coupons or rebates in real time 4 places control in the manufacturer for changing replacing or canceling of coupons or rebates and 5 supports advertising of rebates and coupons on many web servers by providing corresponding coupon and rebate processing. Thus the system automates the traditional human intensive coupon and rebate processing.

The system supports automatic and manual adjustments of promotional offerings i.e. coupons rebates etc. Automatic adjustments may be triggered by a variety of parameters such as the amounts of coupons and rebates distributed the amount of coupons and rebates redeemed current product inventory levels of the manufacturer or the distributor or retailer the shelf life of products in inventory etc. Adjustments may include increasing or decreasing the promotional value i.e. the amount of the coupon or rebate the quantity of coupons or rebates to be distributed the term of the coupon or rebate the goods to which the coupon or rebate may apply or any other coupon or rebate parameter. The automatic adjustment parameters may be set up by the manufacturer retailer distributor or system administrator via a web browser interface. Such interface may also be used to modify such automatic adjustment parameters change the coupon or rebate parameters or withdraw the coupon or rebate.

Customers are presented with a catalog of products to choose from by the web server or server environment associated with the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption when they visit the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . If the customer selects one or more products from the catalog or list of products available at the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption they are provided with the option of purchasing the products with the automatic retrieval and application of rebates and coupons. They are also provided with the option of downloading them for purchasing those products at a future time.

If the customer elects to purchase the selected products from the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption all applicable rebates and coupons are applied to the customer s purchases by the system in the determination of a final purchase price for the customer. The customer can consummate the purchase by using a credit card for payment. The system processes customer s credit cards for sales processing.

Customer profiles typically provided by customers during a customer profile generation activity are selectively used by the system to complete sales transactions and to ship products. Customer profile includes shipping address credit card related information etc. Once a customer profile is created it is used to expedite subsequent customer purchases. Customers who choose not to have a profile created for them may be required to enter their shipping address credit card related information etc. during each purchasing activity.

In one embodiment of the present invention a customer using the computer and the Internet connection accesses one or more rebate and coupon dispensing web pages presented by a server environment associated with and communicatively coupled with the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . In this embodiment the customer would retrieve one or more coupons and rebates for one or more products that the customer plans to purchase by browsing through several categories of products presented by the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . The rebates and coupons for products are also located by searching for them via a searching interface. The customer then activates a purchase button to purchase the products. The system completes a purchase order for the customer incorporating all the products selected by the customer and applying all applicable rebates and coupons. It also performs order fulfillment operations aimed at assigning products from its inventory to the customer.

In one embodiment the inventory of some of the products purchasable from the system is selectively maintained by the manufacturer merchant environment . For such products to perform order fulfillment activities the system interacts with the manufacturer merchant environment over the connection in one of two approaches. In the first approach the manufacturer merchant environment receives purchase orders to some products currently available in their inventory from the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption along with rebate and coupon information in order to perform order fulfillment for the customer. The customer profile or a subset thereof is visible to the manufacturer merchant environment which then ships the products to the customer. In effect the customer pays the manufacturer merchant environment directly for the products purchased from it.

In the second approach the system purchases the products using all associated coupons and rebates from the manufacturer merchant environment on behalf of the customer and has the purchased products shipped directly to the customer. In this scenario the system acts as a purchaser and pays for the products purchased from the manufacturer merchant environment . It then bills the customer for the actual purchase price that incorporates relevant rebates and coupons. Thus the customer benefits from the instantaneous redemption of coupons and rebates facilitated by the coupon dispensing and redemption system .

In one embodiment the system serves as a front end to the e commerce sites of manufacturers and merchants wherein customers purchase products from the system and reimburse it say via credit cards for the products purchased online. The system in turn acquires the products purchased by the customer from designated suppliers such as manufacturers distributors or retail merchants. A supplier is selected based on the product category the inventories of products at the various suppliers the business arrangements made with various suppliers and other criteria. In effect the supplier sells the products to the system which ensures the redemption of all available coupons and rebates for the purchases. The system sells those products back to the customer passing most of the savings from rebates and coupons to the customer. The system selectively charges the suppliers a transaction fee for generating their business. The customer is also selectively made to pay a service charge to the system for its seamless and automatic rebate and coupon redemption.

In another embodiment of the present invention the customer retrieves rebates and coupons from the system and then saves these rebates and coupons preferably in his browser software or on the hard disk of his computer . Such rebates and coupons are preferably saved in electronic form for subsequent submission to the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption or to the manufacturer merchant environment during a purchasing activity. When presented with such coupons during any purchasing activity the manufacturer merchant environment presents them over the connection to the system for selective coupon and rebate authentication and selective redemption.

In another exemplary scenario the online customer using the personal computer accesses the Internet via a connection employing a modem on his computer and a browser software on his computer. He then using his browser software navigates to a manufacturer merchant environment such as an electronic mall to purchase one or more items of his choice. A connection established over the Internet between the computer and the manufacturer merchant environment allows user selection of purchasable items optionally via a catalog of items presented to the customer by the manufacturer merchant environment . After selecting the desired items into a shopping cart the customer invokes a rebate and coupon button on a screen presented by the manufacturer merchant environment that results in the submission of the shopping cart to the system via a connection . In response the system selectively returns all applicable coupons to each of the items in the customers shopping cart. This includes manufacturer s coupons retailer s coupons etc. In addition if any items in the shopping cart are not specific enough to unambiguously identify a manufacturer the system returns coupons for multiple manufacturers of similar products for the customer to choose from. The returned rebates and coupons are automatically applied by the manufacturer merchant environment in the determination and display of a final price for the customer.

To submit online information on coupons to the system so that they can be dispensed to customers one or more manufacturer merchant environments employ a connection which is some cases such as the Internet may be the same as the link used by the manufacturer merchant environment to extract coupons on behalf of a customer from the system for online sales automatic rebate and coupon redemption .

The system selectively provides manufacturers and merchants information on the customer s region the volume of sales the material velocity of the products etc. thus giving manufacturer merchant environment the ability to change coupons based on their sales goals and other criteria.

In one embodiment of the present invention the system receives a List of Purchases or Shopping Cart from customers. In response it prices the shopping cart and automatically applies all relevant rebates and coupons to the various products in the shopping cart. It then performs order fulfillment activities to ship the products to the customer.

In general coupons and rebates dispensed by the system may be selectively saved by customers for subsequent redemption. Saved coupons and rebates have an associated expiry date. The manufacturer merchant environment may choose not to honor coupons that have expired. In one embodiment of the present invention the manufacturer merchant environment interacts with the system to determine if an expired rebate or coupon should automatically be replaced by a newer one.

In another embodiment the coupons and rebates being dispensed are generated in Extensible Manipulation Language XML format. The customer s computer may or may not be able to process such XML documents. If for example the customer s browser cannot process the coupon information then it does not display such information properly and gives the customer the option to save the coupon in the computer s hard disk. Such XML coupons may not be processed by the manufacturer merchant environment either if the information systems at their web site are not capable of processing XML based coupons. In such situations the XML based coupons and other coupons that cannot be processed are returned to the system by the manufacturer merchant environment for processing and for redemption.

When customers decide to purchase products from the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption a pricing manager provides pricing functionality that incorporates calculation of prices based on several factors including available rebates and coupons. The pricing manager also includes a credit card processing unit that processes credit card based customer sales and a sales support unit that provides quote generation features. An order fulfillment manager provides information on available inventory of products. If a product purchased by a customer is not in stock or not stored locally at the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption the order fulfillment manager makes it possible to purchase that product from the manufacturer distributors or merchants. Such purchases are done in one of two ways seamlessly where the customer does not realize that the product is being acquired from a manufacturer or merchant or explicitly where the customer is aware of the participation of a manufacturer or merchant in the fulfillment of his purchase order.

Online Customers access the system over the connection . They can browse through the online browsable catalog of products and services or search for a specific product or service based on criteria such as product category geographical region brand names etc. Manufacturers and Online Merchants access the system over the connection .

In one embodiment of the present invention when providing access to customers who want to download coupons and rebates the system contains a browsable indexed selection software making it easy for the customer to locate or search the required coupon or rebate. It also provides vectors to advertising placed by manufacturers or online merchants located either at the web server or at an external web server. In addition it can provide vectors to sales points such as online merchants or electronic malls where the associated products may be available for sale if it is not currently available for sale at the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . Moreover the dispensed coupons and rebates can be automatically incorporated into the pricing logic of a merchant or manufacturer s electronic commerce system to which the system provides links for customer access.

In a similar embodiment of the present invention coupon verification is performed by the electronic commerce software of the manufacturer or online merchant to which a customer migrates to from the browsable indexed coupon selection software along with a coupon and or rebate for one or more products. This implies that a customer can consummate a purchase of a product at a merchant or manufacturer s e commerce site following the selection of a coupon or rebate from the system and subsequent vectoring with a coupon and or rebate to the e commerce site.

The system provides a circular path for identifying the users of dispensed coupons and rebates when coupons previously downloaded by customers are returned by online merchants or manufacturers for redemption. Thus buying habits and patterns of coupon access of individual customers can be determined. Such information may be used in the generation of appropriate coupons for individual customers as well as for creating marketing plans by online merchants and manufacturers.

Downloaded coupons may be printed as bar coded coupons by customers for subsequent redemption at traditional neighborhood merchant shops. The printing is facilitated by a print engine that is either available at the customer s computer or can be easily downloaded to the customer s computer. The same is true for coupons and rebates emailed to customers by the system as part of a targeted coupons dispensing activity in which individual customers are targeted to receive appropriate coupons based upon their shopping behavior as determined by system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . Automatic targeting of customers by the system is based on customer s buying habits current marketing promotions etc. via for e.g. electronic mail email . Customers have the ability to redeem them without having to print it as is typically done for purchases from online merchants.

In one embodiment the system provides credit to customers for coupons redeemed by the customers. It subsequently dispenses further coupons to those customers based on their credits earned. Such coupons may be used by the customers either for further online purchases or for purchases at a traditional store. In addition coupons are obtained at a traditional neighborhood store redeemable during the customer s next online purchase. Such coupons are redeemed by customers during online purchases where they are provided with the opportunity to specify information about the coupons.

Coupons typically have an associated expiry date. Vendors assign expiry dates to not only the advertisements of products but also for their associated coupons. While browsing the web server for products and coupons when customers are presented with an advertisement they are also presented with a coupon for it. A displayed advertisement vectors seamlessly via a link to an associated manufacturer s or merchant s online information website. If a customer activates such a link to a online merchant s e commerce site if necessary in order to facilitate the expected sale. Information carried by the coupon s may be employed by pricing and quote generation components of a merchant s e commerce software.

In general the system integrates with sales force automation SFA software employed by manufacturers and merchants. It also integrates with e commerce platforms that provide multi vendor sales. For the multi vendor platforms where similar products from multiple vendors are available for sale the system selectively dispenses generic coupons that will apply towards a product from any of the participating vendors. Such generic coupons may be provided to a customer along with a vendor supplied coupon if any.

In one embodiment of the present invention information related to the geographical location of a customer is selectively used by system in determining the type and or value of coupon to dispense. For example a manufacturer may desire to provide coupons of different value and expiry dates for the same product in different sales regions. The system makes it possible to customize the different attributes of a coupon such as its value expiry date etc. to specific geographical zones or to specific user types. For example a corporate customer may be provided a different coupon from those provided to non corporate customers.

The system optionally charges manufacturers and online merchants for its services. These charges may be levied by one of several different methods some of them related to the number of customers who download coupons some related to the number of customers who redeem those coupons and others related to both these attributes. For example local small businesses may provide a coupon and they are charged based on the number of coupon s accessed or redeemed.

The system captures the list of people who access it and download coupons. The local small businesses that employ the services of the system pay a charge based on such a list. They can also update their coupons automatically via an interface to the coupon generation component of the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption .

To facilitate location of a coupon for a product by a customer in one embodiment the system provides a web interface where coupons are categorized into different product categories and a customer browses using a web browser through categories and sub categories of products to locate one or more coupons. The system also categorizes coupons by manufacturers and merchants. If a customer purchases one or more products on the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption the rebates and coupons if any are automatically applied to the final price for the customer.

Internet portals such as Yahoo and Internet web services such as Internet service providers ISPs can provide an automatic connection to the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption so as to provide their readers information on available coupons on one or more products associated with the currently displayed web page. Such coupon related links or information is displayed in one of the frames displayed on the customer s web browser. Alternatively these portals can route web browsers automatically to the system to retrieve associated coupons if necessary say in a pop up screen or frame automatically created by the currently visible web page provided by the portal. Thus readers of web content provided by web page hosts and portals can retrieve coupons while they browse product information.

To facilitate the creation of coupons by manufacturers and online merchants the system provides canned images and coupon frames based on category that may be further customized by manufacturers and online merchants to suit their needs.

Customers search for coupons by category and region. In general four types of coupons are supported coupons from retailer coupons from distributors coupons from manufacturer and coupons from managers of point of sale devices. Other types of coupons can be easily incorporated.

The online nature of the coupon system provided by system makes it possible for merchants and manufacturers to devise a coupon based marketing and sales strategy where the expiry date and the volume of coupons in a marketing campaign are dynamically adjusted to meet goals. For example current sales volume might determine changes to coupons value and for expiry date. It would be possible to stop coupons associated with a marketing campaign if sales targets are met. It would also be possible to yank out a coupon based marketing campaign if necessary.

The success of a rebate and or coupon based marketing and sales campaign can be dynamically and frequently ascertained. Automatic reports on coupon distribution and the redemption rates of coupons are provided to the manufacturers and merchants by the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption .

Identity of potential customers who access coupons and those who redeem them are maintained by the system for online sales with automatic rebate and coupon redemption . Such customer related information can later be used for mass mailing distribution of coupons. Manufacturers and merchants provide information on their mass mailing needs and system mails or emails coupons based on those needs and on online customer information collected automatically. Once coupons are mailed to potential customers they are tracked to see if they are ever redeemed. Tracking of mailed coupons provides information related to the efficacy of sales and marketing strategy employed.

If a new product is being released by a manufacturer the system is used to setup manage and monitor promotional activities based on coupons and or rebates. The time frame for such promotional activities the number of coupons and or rebates to be dispensed the duration and time frame for the promotional activities etc. are set by the manufacturer using the promotional server of . The manufacturer may modify the parameters of the coupons and or rebates such as coupon or rebate amount the quantity the duration the applicable products etc. based on a preset threshold quantity of dispensed coupons or rebates based on monitored sales activities etc.

The system can be used to adaptably move inventory by managing the amount and quantity of rebates and coupons. Therefore the system incorporates inventory tracking coupon and rebate amount management marketing activities sales tracking and other business functions so as to make it possible to not only create promotional material but also to manage modify the promotional activities based on buyer response to such promotional activities.

The system makes it possible to integrate coupon delivery with software registration and product surveys. Customers who buy and install software are often reluctant to register them with the vendor. This situation is true for other types of products too. In order to provide an incentive for registration of products the manufacturers or vendors of such products can integrate the system with the registration process so that customers might be enticed with coupons for their next purchase.

The system also provides support for the retrieval of coupons for products to be purchased at neighborhood stores. Such retrieved coupons are printed on laser printers and taken by the customers to the stores for redemption during a purchase.

An advantage of incorporating a coupon authenticator component in the system is the ability to verify if a coupon has already been redeemed. This makes it possible to enforce a redemption rule of one coupon per customer. Copies of a redeemed coupon are disallowed if necessary. Customers can be informed when a coupon is being reused. For example they can be told to get newer ones rather than use old ones.

In one embodiment coupons or rebates that have expired are automatically exchanged with newer ones. If necessary a 24 hour grace period may be permitted for redemption of coupons to account for time zones too.

Online buyer s register with the promotional server via buyer s web client in order to automatically register products purchased online with the manufacturers for warranties and other services with the help of the promotional server receive refunds due to the buyer from the application of coupons and or rebates to online purchases consummated by buyer on third party seller s web and application server and to receive information on product information sales discounts product recall etc. via email or by other mechanisms.

The promotional server hosts promotional offer posting from a plurality of issuers. The issuers may be manufacturers of goods providers of services distributors of manufactured goods online retailers etc. The promotional offer postings hosted by the promotional server are coupons rebates etc. Promotional offer postings are governed by parameters such as the manufacturer the associated product the monetary amount of the promotional offer the quantity of the promotional offer the time frame and any other parameters that may govern promotions. The issuers have the ability to manipulate these parameters using the issuer s web client . They also have the ability to create promotional offer postings manage them and manipulate the associated parameters via an issuer s direct application interface .

In one embodiment the promotional offer posting comprises a portal that lists a plurality of promotions such as coupons rebates etc. The promotions are categorized based on types of goods and services being sold through the various seller s web servers. A search engine is also provided to assist in locating specific promotions from the plurality. For example the buyer through the web client might browse to find the available coupons and rebates for a hand held computer under the general category of computer systems. Alternatively the buyer might enter the terms hand held computer to direct a search through all of the plurality of promotions to find promotions matching such terms.

This search engine may also be used to supplement other search engines of sellers portals etc. For example on a first search engine a buyer may enter search terms which are used to search a corresponding database for information goods or services that are offered for sale. Such search terms are also used by the promotional server to search the plurality of promotions stored therein. Alternatively the plurality of promotions may also be stored in along with the first search engine for searching through the first search engine.

Typically promotional offer postings are visually presented to all users that invoke an associated promotional element on a web page provided by non seller web servers affiliated seller s web and application server and third party seller s web and application server . However some promotional offer postings are selectively provided based on criteria specified by issuers. Such criteria may include the number of past purchases of the same or similar products by individual buyers the random selection of recipients of specific promotional material by non seller web servers affiliated seller s web and application server and third party seller s web or application server etc.

Buyers have the option of registering with the promotional server over the Internet using the buyer s web client . During such online registration process the buyer provides personal information and credit card information that are stored by the promotional server . The buyer s personal information is selectively used by the promotional server to register products subsequently purchased by the buyer with the associated manufacturer inform the buyer about product recalls etc. selectively forward promotional material to the buyer via email selectively enhance the value of promotional offer postings to specific buyers or to specific category of buyers etc.

In general the promotional server employs several different processes to participate in the consummation of online sales depending upon the nature of integration of the services offered by the promotional server with the services offered by other online sales systems such as the non seller web servers affiliated seller s web and application server and third party seller s web and application server . The specific process employed by the promotional server also determines the approach by which a buyer redeems the amount associated with a coupon or rebate. For example in one embodiment if the buyer consummates an online purchase at the affiliated seller s web and application server the promotional server reimburses the affiliated seller s web and application server or its associated merchant account either immediately or in deferred mode for the amount of the coupon or rebate exercised by the buyer towards the buyer s purchase conducts transactions with the issuer s of the coupon s or rebate s in real time or in deferred mode to redeem the amount of the associated coupons or rebates selectively charges the issuers such as manufacturers providing rebates for services rendered such as those rendered during the buyer s transactions selectively registers products with associated manufacturers for tech support and warranty purposes and selectively updates buyer s profile if necessary with the purchase related information.

The affiliated seller s web and application server is more tightly integrated with the promotional server than is the third party seller s web and application server . This makes it possible for the promotional server to interact in more than one way with the affiliated seller s web and application server in completing a buyer s online purchases. For example in one embodiment the affiliated seller s web and application server charges the buyer only for the actual purchase price taking into account any and all rebates or coupons that may apply towards the buyer s purchases and in turn conducts a transaction with the promotional server to recover the amount of coupon or rebate that is not charged to the customer. The promotional server later interacts with one or more associated issuer to recover the cost of the coupons or rebates redeemed by the buyer. Such interaction is selectively conducted in online interactive mode with issuers or in a batch or deferred mode.

In another embodiment the affiliated seller s web and application server charges the buyer only for the actual purchase price taking into account any and all rebates or coupons that may apply towards the buyer s purchases and recover such amounts associated with the applied coupons and rebates later from the promotional server by billing the promotional server for those amounts. In a variant of this approach the affiliated seller s web and application server informs the promotional server of all rebates and coupons redeemed by its online buyers and the promotional server deposits money such as via electronic fund transfers to any bank account associated or managed by the affiliated seller s web and application server .

In another embodiment the affiliated seller s web and application server retrieves a registered user s profile from the promotional server to present the buyer using the buyer s web client with a set of coupons and rebates tailored to the buyer s interest based on the buyer s profile.

The non seller web server typically carries promotional offer posting that typically provide a vector to associated web pages hosted by the promotional server . By activating the promotional offer posting on web pages provided by the non seller web server the buyer can migrate to online sales related web pages provided by the promotional server and purchase associated products while also availing of rebates and or coupons associated with the purchased product s . In completing the online sales transaction with the buyer the promotional server prompts the buyer for credit card information and shipping information if the buyer is not a registered buyer retrieves coupon or rebate amount for the product s selected by buyer applies all coupons and rebates retrieved for the purchased products selectively interacts with a credit card processing service or credit card company in order to process buyer s credit card information selectively interacts with the issuer of associated promotional offer posting to inform issuer of sales related information and selectively interacts with the issuer to charge the issuer for services provided during the sale.

The third party seller s web and application server although not as integrated with the services provided by the promotional server as the affiliated seller s web and application server interacts with the promotional server to inform the promotional server details of the buyer s online purchases such as the identification and quantity of the products purchased by the buyer along with buyer information such as the buyer s address or bank account while charging the buyer for the full amount for the products purchased without immediately applying the coupons and rebates if any. The promotional server later sends a check to the buyer via post or transfers money to the buyer s bank account or credit card account if such buyer information is provided by the third party seller s web and application server .

In one embodiment the interaction between the promotional server and the issuer s is in real time. Such interaction is typically facilitated by integration software on the issuer s system . The promotional server conducts transactions with the integration software on the issuer s system to send information on redeemed coupons and or rebates to the issuer and to achieve reimbursement for coupons and rebates honored by the promotional server .

In another embodiment the promotional server communicates a list of coupons and rebates honored by buyers to one or more issuer s and the issuer s in turn transfer reimbursements associated with those redeemed coupons and rebates to the promotional server . Such reimbursements may be conducted employing money transfer into an established bank account or by other means such as electronic fund transfer checks etc. The communication between the promotional server and the issuer s systems such as the integration software on the issuer s system or the issuer s direct application interface regarding redeemed coupons and rebates may be conducted in interactive mode in real time in non interactive mode in real time in batch mode in deferred mode batch mode in real time etc.

In one embodiment a buyer using the buyer s web client interacts with the third party seller s web and application server to conduct online purchases. The third party seller s web and application server charges the buyer the full amount on the purchased products including the amount on the rebates and coupons if any rebate or coupon are associated with the purchased products but displays the amount of coupons and or rebates that will be reimbursed to them. Such charges are made to the credit card account provided by the buyer to the third party seller s web and application server . The third party seller s web and application server then interacts with the promotional server to communicate details of the online purchases made by the buyer and buyer information including the buyer s credit card account information. The promotional server then reimburses the buyer the total of all the coupons and or rebates that apply to the buyer s purchases by conducting a transaction with the credit card processing service or the credit card company companies . Such reimbursement transactions with the credit card processing service or the credit card company companies are selectively conducted in real time or in deferred mode after batching one or more buyer redemptions.

In one embodiment the third party seller s web and application server does not provide any indication of the completion of a buyer s online purchase to the promotional server . Instead the promotional server determines the completion of online purchase by the buyer from the third party seller s web and application server and determines the buyer information details and details of products purchased from sales completion document made available to the buyer from the third party seller s web and application server . Such sales completion document may be an online purchase order provided to the buyer or an online order tracking web page presented to the buyer. Other mechanisms for determining purchase order completion may be employed by the promotional server to determine the completion of online purchases by the buyer.

In one embodiment manufacturers selectively use the promotional server as a mechanism for providing up sell information to buyers when buyers using buyer s web client access promotional offer posting located at non seller web servers affiliated seller s web and application server and third party seller s web and application server respectively.

In another embodiment of the present invention when a buyer using one of buyer s web clients accesses a specific promotional offer posting such as a coupon or rebate presented by the non seller web servers the affiliated seller s web and application server or the third party seller s web and application server respectively the buyer is presented with a list of promotional material for other products that the buyer is deemed to be interested in by the promotional server . Such a list of promotional material may include promotional materials for other similar products by the same manufacturer promotional materials that belong to the same category of products as the one the buyer initially evinced interest in promotional materials for only those products that the associated manufacturer considers relevant to the buyer promotional material for all competing or associated products from the same or different manufacturers or promotional material determined to be useful to the buyer by the individual web servers .

In one embodiment the buyer using the affiliated seller s web and application server the buyer can assemble a shopping cart of products that is presented and maintained by the affiliated seller s web and application server . The buyer can then request the affiliated seller s web and application server to extract all applicable coupons and rebates to the shopping cart. The affiliated seller s web and application server interacts with the promotional server to extract all applicable coupons and rebates for the buyer s shopping cart. It then applies the extracted coupons and rebates to the shopping cart.

In another embodiment the buyer using the buyer s web client assembles a shopping cart with online products at a different online sales web server than the affiliated seller s web and application server and then transfers the shopping cart to the promotional server to extract all applicable coupons and rebates. The transfer of the shopping cart by the buyer to the promotional server is implemented in one of several ways by the transfer of an XML file to the promotional server via an HTTP connection to the promotional server by uploading shopping cart information stored in a file or in memory at the client computer to the promotional server via upload web pages provided by the promotional server by sending a shopping cart in an email to the promotional server the shopping cart represented as an XML document or as some other structured document or by other common techniques to transfer a shopping cart to the promotional server . A buyer may choose to retrieve applicable coupons and rebates based on their current shopping cart contents by interacting with the promotional server via the affiliated seller s web and application server or via the third party seller s web and application server . In both cases the promotional server facilitates the automatic redemption of rebates and coupons that can apply towards the buyer s online purchases. In some embodiments the buyer is unaware of the promotional server and presumes the automatic redemption of rebates and coupons to be provided by the web server that the buyer conducts his purchases from.

In a multi functional embodiment of the promotional server supports multiple processing approaches for facilitating promotion redemption. When a buyer attempts to purchase a good or service on a third party seller s web and application server the third party seller s web and application server receives full payment for the good or service offered. If the buyer s account supports charge back then the promotional server will charge back the promotional amount to the buyer s account after the buyer has completed the purchase for the entire sales price. Otherwise the promotional server will pay the third party seller s web and application server the full sales price itself and charge the buyer s account for the sales price less the promotional amount. In either case the promotional server will charge the issuer s account for the promotional amount.

Service charges can be applied to the issuer or the issuer s account buyer s account and or to the third party seller s web and application server . Such surcharge service charges can be used to collect value for services rendered by the promotional server . In addition the issuer and or the buyer may pay more than the promotional amount and or sales price less the promotional amount respectively as an incentive to the buyer and or the seller.

In such interaction the third party seller s web and application server need not be aware of the issuer s promotion amount. Even if aware the third party seller s web and application server need not account for the promotion amount of the issuer in the offering price of the item. In either case however the promotional server identifies when the transaction for the promoted item has been completed.

Similarly a buyer interacts through the promotional server and the affiliated seller s web and application server to purchase a good and exercise a promotion. This is accomplished by making two account transactions with the affiliated seller s web and application server . Specifically the buyer s account is used to pay the sales price less the promotion amount while the issuer s account is used to pay the promotion amount.

The promotional server also supports full payment of the sales price of an item by the issuer s account. When so charged the promotional server will assist in the payment from the buyer s account to the issuer for the purchase price less the promotion amount. Of course surcharges and incentives might also be applied in such transactions.

The buyer s account may comprise an account such as a credit card or bank account that is independent of the promotional server. Alternatively the buyer s account may be a credit or deposit account managed directly by the promotional server. Similarly the issuer s account might be a credit or deposit account managed directly by the promotional server. Promotional server may bill an issuer and or buyer s account on a monthly basis or charge the issuer and or buyer s account immediately.

The promotional server can perform credit or account processing directly through the processing service or allow such processing to be performed by the servers and via the corresponding services and .

In another embodiment the promotional server constructs a promotional offer posting from a plurality of issuers of promotions and corresponding sales information retrieved from a seller or the seller s web and application server. A buyer browses by category or searches the sales information in the promotional offer posting to identify an item for purchasing. Upon receiving a purchase request for such item from the buyer the promotional server charges the buyer s account for the sales price less the promotional amount then uses the promotional server s account which may be set up by the issuer or through contributions from the issuer for example to pay the full sales price directly to the seller. Although tighter integration may be used the promotional server need only deliver its account information buyer s shipping information and the sales item s information to the non integrated seller s online sales system. The seller s system need not distinguish this interaction with traditional online sales interaction with a buyer without promotions.

Of course there are many variations and further processing functionality that may be applied to this process. For example the purchase amount may comprise the sales price amount less the rebate amount and may further comprise a service charge amount. The purchase amount may also comprise an amount lower than the sales price amount and greater than the sales price amount less the rebate amount.

The manufacturer may also control the rebate. This may involve adjusting a rebate parameter or canceling the rebate. Rebate parameters may include for example a rebate amount quantity of rebates offered rebate offering time frame rebate terms and conditions goods or services associated with the rebate particular sellers to which the rebate applies manufacturer and or distributors involved the issuer automatic thresholds and conditions under which other rebate parameters will change passwords and other account information regarding the issuer or other parties involved etc.

In certain embodiments associated with the block the purchase amount is electronically collected by the seller. The purchase amount may comprise the sales price amount less the rebate amount plus a service charge amount. Similarly the manufacturer may be electronically charged at least the rebate amount which may consist of the rebate amount plus a service charge amount. At least a portion of the service charge amount if not all may be distributed to the seller. Similarly at least a portion of the service charge amount if not all may be distributed to a promotional system for services rendered.

An account of the buyer is charged the purchase amount in the block in some embodiments. At least a portion of the charged amount may be directly delivering to the seller. In such configurations the charging may be performed via a promotional system. Alternatively the buyer s account may be charged an amount corresponding to the sales price amount and credited an amount corresponding to the rebate amount. The purchase amount may include a service charge amount that is also charged to the buyer s account. In various embodiments the buyer interacts online to cause payment to the seller of the sales price amount less the rebate amount and the manufacturer electronically pays the rebate amount to the seller. A manufacturer s account may be used for paying at least the rebate amount. The manufacturer s account may be established in association with a promotional system or independently. Such payments may be performed directly or via a promotional system.

In Internet applications a web server may be used to deliver the manufacturer s rebate to a browser of the buyer. The manufacturer s rebate may comprise one of a plurality of manufacturer s rebates delivered by the web server. The web server may operate as at least a part of a promotional system a seller s system an affiliate s system or a third party s system. In any case the system may comprise a rebate system offering or supporting only promotional items for sale.

Other extensions of the present invention involve the selection of a potential buyer and delivering a manufacturer s rebate to the selected buyer. Among other traditional delivery infrastructures delivery may be performed via email. Selection of the potential buyer may be based on the previous purchase history of the selected buyer and or registration information. The manufacturer through human interaction may make such selection with information regarding each potential buyer or automatically pursuant to a manufacturer s defined set of filtering criteria. More than one manufacturer s rebate may be sent to the selected buyer.

The present invention also supports shopping cart interaction. Shopping carts or logical equivalents thereof may contain the item for sale and at least one other item for sale. The promotional system may identify the item in the shopping cart. After identifying the sales item the purchase request may be responded to.

A visual rebate element may be displayed for a buyer. The element will typically contain at least one of the plurality of rebate parameters. The visual rebate element can be involved in the association of the rebate with the item for sale. Third party systems may offer for a buyer s selection one or more visual rebate elements. The elements may also direct the buyer to an item for sale on a sales system of the seller. Visual rebate elements can be banner ads or other advertisements for example. Visual rebate elements may also direct the buyer to other of the plurality of rebate parameters.

In some implementations the seller will not fulfill a purchase request without receiving an amount corresponding to the purchase amount and the rebate amount. The language corresponding to as used herein and throughout the application attempts to clarify that any such amount need not be exact. For example a seller may fulfill the purchase request by receiving the purchase amount plus the rebate amount but less or plus a surcharge e.g. for service rendered . Such surcharge may be applied through the payment of the purchase amount the rebate amount both the purchase and the rebate amounts or along with both amounts if the charges are paid to the seller in one transaction etc. Therefore the use of the language corresponding to anticipates that the exact amounts need not be paid to accomplish the payment purpose.

As with the rebate processing functionality there are many variations and further functionality that may be applied to such coupon processing. In fact the aforementioned variations and further functionality of the rebate processing described with reference to can be applied to the coupon embodiment of . For example the purchase amount may comprise the sales price amount less the rebate amount and include a service charge amount either party may control the coupon and coupon parameters which parallel that of rebates payments of the purchase amount and coupon amounts may be electronically made to the first party buyer and third party accounts may be used etc. Similarly in Internet applications a web server may be used to deliver a coupon from one or more coupons stored on the web server to a buyer s browser. The web server may operate as at least a part of a promotional system a first party s system a second party s system an affiliate s system or a third party s system. In any case the system may comprise a system supporting coupon processing alone or in combination with other promotional activities such as rebates. Many other extensions of the present invention as applied to coupon processing can be found above in relation to the processing of rebates as described above with reference to .

The facilitation mentioned above may be achieved by the gathering of sales transaction information from the first online system. Such facilitation may further include the automatic generation of an invoice corresponding to the sales transaction information gathered.

Facilitation may also be achieved by the payment of an amount corresponding to the promotion amount. Facilitation in this case may further include the automatic generation of an invoice corresponding to the promotion amount. In addition it may include the automatic generation of an offsetting accounting entry corresponding to the promotion amount. Such offsetting accounting entry may be for example a debit entry or a credit entry.

The method may also permit control of the promotion via the second online system. In this case a service charge may also be assessed for services rendered by the second online system.

In particular the sales server identifies the servers of the manufacturers suppliers and or service providers hereinafter source servers underlying the client request at a block . Thereafter at a block the sales server establishes secure communication with such source servers to retrieve promotion information including terms and conditions for such promotions as buy one item get a different item for free buy get one free coupons rebates etc. along with related sales information including but not limited to pricing inventory images descriptions warranty information licensing information third party reviews and links to further information.

In the real time mode of operation the retrieval process within the block occurs upon receiving each client request. In a periodic mode of operation the sales server only performs the functions of block for example once every 24 hour period. Of course any period may be possible. In an aged mode of operation the sales server performs the functions of the block only if the information underlying the client request has not been retrieved for a period of time. In other words if a client request that occurred fifteen minutes earlier caused the retrieval of information from a source server then such information need not be requested again by the source server at least for a predetermined duration of time such as for six hours. Thus for example a single request from a client may cause the retrieval of locally stored information recently retrieved regarding some products or services along with remotely retrieved information regarding other products or services from source servers that have old information stored locally with the old information being updated in the process.

Regardless of the mode of operation of the sales server at a block the sales server uses the retrieved product and or service information to construct a web page which is delivered to the client browser for viewing at a block . Of course such construction and delivery may take any other form. For example the information may be constructed for printing emailed faxed voice synthesized for telephone playback etc. Many other construction and delivery mechanisms are well known and may be used.

In response the sales server which may comprise one or more servers will respond by constructing the web page or page content from product and or service information underlying the buyer s request. As mentioned in reference to the sales server may retrieve the required product and or service information hereinafter sales information from one or more of a plurality of source servers such as source servers or manufacturer s servers and and or from memory local to the sales server . The specific timing of such retrieval of sales information depends entirely on the mode of operation in which the sales server is operating as previously described.

To retrieve sales information the sales server establishes a secure link with one or more of the source servers and . Each sales server typically comprises among other things a product or services database which itself may contain images promotion information and other sales information for example. Thus after receiving a request from the buyer via the buyer s browser the sales server if operating in the aged mode will respond by first looking to local storage to determine whether the sales information underlying the request exist locally. For portions of the sales information that exists locally and is not too old such information is used in the construction of a response to be sent to the buyer s browser . For all portions of the sales information that is too old or does not exist locally the sales server establishes secured links with one or more of the source servers and to retrieve such information. Similar operation for the other modes of operation is also possible.

Moreover in some embodiments the mode of operation of the sales server is defined by the sales information itself. For example a buyer s request may require that two products from two different manufacturers be displayed in a single web page. The first product may require the aged mode of operation while the second product may require a real time mode. Similarly any portion of the sales information may define its own required mode. For example general image information may operate under a periodic mode while the price or an associated promotion might require the real time mode for control purposes.

Fall back modes are also contemplated when the desired mode fails. For example if a real time mode fails the sales server may be authorized to resort to an aged or periodic mode of operation so long as the conditions underlying conditions for use are met. Other variations such as modified or combined versions of the modes or fall back strategies identified above are also contemplated and will be apparent to one skilled in the art after considering such disclosed modes.

The secured communication from the sales servers to the source servers may occur through an ASP architecture. A variety of encryption and compression techniques can be used to provide secure and minimal bandwidth utilization between servers.

The source servers and are thus able to control and modify any of the sales content without worrying about the buyer basing a purchase on outdated data existing at the sales servers and . For example a coupon can be tracked by the source server for a product sold by the sales servers and . Once a certain volume is reached as counted through direct feedback from the sales servers and as sales occur the source server can remove the coupon ending this promotion. The source server can make this decision automatically based on a predetermined number or a number calculated based on current warehouse inventory for example.

Referring to when a Buyer i.e. individuals or business entities such as for example corporations distributers or retailers desires to purchase several Products i.e. goods or services from a plurality of Sellers i.e. manufacturers distributers or retailers via the Internet the Buyer typically must first via the Buyer s computer search for the Products and locate the various Sellers online using for example a listing site and or search engine . The search results may for example identify a Seller System that only sells a desired Product A a Seller s System that only sells a desired Product B a Seller s System that sells both desired Products a Seller s System that sells neither of the desired Products and a Seller that maintains a Non Sales System . The Buyer however does not know which System identified will support the desired purchase until the Buyer undertakes the time consuming process of accessing and navigating each of the identified Seller s Systems. The Buyer must then find the prices for the Products and select the Seller or Sellers from which to buy the Products. Often during the selection process the Buyer must access and re access selected Seller s System s to compare the Products and their prices.

In other words the Buyer is faced with the problem of identifying the type and model of the Products desired the Seller s that carry them and whether those Seller s support on line purchases. In addition if the Buyer eventually identifies several Products that might meet the desired requirements the Buyer has no easy way to compare the Products or their prices regardless of whether the Buyer is looking for the Same Products i.e. identical Products from a single manufacturer sold by multiple Sellers or Similar Products i.e. like Products from different manufacturers sold by multiple Sellers . Moreover once the Product s and Seller s are finally selected the Buyer must often undertake multiple transactions with at least one transaction for each Seller.

The above process is further complicated by the fact that the initial step of identifying via the internet the desired Products and the Sellers who provide the Products is not inherently easy. Search engines often provide unorganized results. The Buyer is therefore required to undergo the further time consuming process of sifting through the search results just to locate possible matches.

In general therefore even though comparing Products and prices by conducting searches using a search engine or listing site such as Excite or Yahoo is possible the process is not very productive especially if the Buyer wants to specify an upper limit to the price the Buyer is willing to pay for one or more Products. Search query formulations on typical search engines simply do not enable a Buyer to specify upper limits for Product prices. In addition as mentioned above if a Buyer locates one or more Sellers the Buyer must interact with each one individually and often sequentially to determine if a purchase can be made. Of course no two sales systems picked at random are likely to be similar. Therefore the Buyer must learn to query the sales system of each and every Seller.

To make matters more complicated Buyers often like to receive quotes for the cost of purchasing a set of Products from different Sellers without having to consummate any purchase right away. The Buyer is usually not permitted to save such quotes at the Sellers System requiring the Buyer to re request quotes every time the System is accessed. This problem is compounded when a Buyer identifies Products desired from different Sellers and views quotes for some of those Products without the ability to save any of the quotes for subsequent access and use.

Even if a Buyer prints quotes provided by multiple Sellers if the Buyer wants to change the desired Product list and generate a new quote for the changed Product list from a particular Seller the Buyer is often required to interact with that Seller s online Sales System to enter the information all over again. In the rare situation where a Seller allows a Buyer to save quotes for some duration those saved quotes are likely to be discarded by the Seller after a period of suspended sales activity.

Once the Buyer finally gets to the point of actually purchasing Products via the internet the Buyer must interact with each Seller individually and sequentially to provide the Buyer s shipping information and credit card related information. Usually the Buyer is prompted to provide such information before the Buyer can consummate a purchase. If the amount quoted by an online Seller for the currently selected Products from a Buyer s list is larger than the available credit on the credit card provided by the Buyer the sales activity is often terminated. Even when the Buyer is in possession of multiple credit cards and their combined available credit exceeds the quoted amount for a Products list it is often not possible for the Buyer to complete the purchase due to the inability of the online Sales System of the Seller to handle such complicated transactions.

In addition to the problems discussed above a Buyer that is also a corporation experiences its own unique set of problems when it buys in bulk from online Sellers. For example the Buyer often must have sufficient storage capacity to house the Product purchased before the Product can be distributed. In addition when a Buyer is purchasing and storing the Product as such the Buyer is often paying a higher price for the Product than it would have paid if the Buyer had simply waited and bought the Product when the Buyer was ready to distribute it. This is particularly true of high technology Products such as for example computers whose prices drop rapidly as the state of the art improves. Thus it is often desirable for a Buyer to determine the cost of purchasing just some of the desired Products in the near future as opposed to purchasing them all at a current time period. There is currently no online sales system in widespread usage that enables a Buyer to obtain graduated quotes as such. Consequently the advantages of buying in bulk online are often vitiated.

Additionally when a Seller sells one or more Products to a Buyer on the internet there is often an opportunity for the Seller or for other Sellers to sell a related but distinct item to the Buyer that is perhaps available at another Seller s online Sales System. For example a Buyer purchasing a computer from an online Seller may also be in the market for a computer desk and a computer chair. However nearly all such sales opportunities go undetected and untapped because Sellers do not have the ability or motivation to automatically share sales related activity information with each other.

Further if a Seller has built up inventory of one or more Products that it wants to dispose of at an accelerated rate it has no means to offload such inventory online.

Small Sellers experience even more difficulty in selling Products online. Before even buying Products via the internet Buyers generally need to have confidence in the Sellers which may not be the case unless the seller is well known or has a good reputation. Absent such confidence Buyers may decide to pay a higher price simply for the comfort of dealing with a known Seller.

In addition small online Sellers often do not have the Sales Systems necessary to provide online sales support. Such online Sales Systems often require web hosting services product configuration and pricing databases credit card processing systems etc. Small online Sellers often purchase web hosting and sales support services from internet service providers or from online malls However Buyers can only get to such Seller s Sales System when Buyers locate and subsequently migrate to them for browsing.

Sellers often provide coupons and rebates as an incentive to promote sales of specific Products. Sellers who offer coupons on the internet experience their own unique set of problems. More specifically referring to in a typical scenario a manufacturer first must speculate to identify the timing amount and quantity of each rebate and coupon. The manufacturer creates and delivers paper rebates coupons to a distributor who forwards the paper rebates coupons to a retailer . The manufacturer may deliver the paper rebates coupons directly to the retailer . To use a rebate coupon the retailer must modify their product database web server content and possibly their sales application. This burden along with the burden of having to collect from the manufacturer dissuades the retailer from participating in the rebate coupon process.

Alternatively the manufacturer may use a third party to deliver the coupons rebates directly to the Buyer.

In addition Sellers who provide coupons and rebates for Products on the internet often do not have the ability to control the amounts dispensed or to whom they are dispensed. This often leads to problems when too many or too few rebates coupons are dispensed online by a Seller. A manufacturer desires to determine the rate at which the rebates coupons are accessed and redeemed by Buyers so as to alter the volume of rebates coupons offered or discount given. However rebates offered on the internet cannot be easily tracked and without such tracking a Seller cannot determine when to alter the rebate coupon value or the number of rebates coupons dispensed.

Furthermore in most situations retail Sellers on the internet do not have the ability or the facility to honor rebates supplied by manufacturers or distributors. This is also true for coupons. Buyers are then left with no option for redeeming such coupons and rebates. In the case of rebates Buyers might be able to send the rebates along with the Buyer s sales receipts to manufacturers via post snail mail and subsequently redeem them via post.

Additionally when Buyers are typically provided a quote by the online sales system of online Sellers for the products selected for purchase the Buyers have the option to cancel the transactions and not purchase any Products. When they choose not to consummate a sale after a quote is provided to them the Sellers do not have a second opportunity to provide a better quote or sweeten the deal causing the Seller to lose a potential sale.

After receiving the Products purchased from various Sellers if the Buyer is interested in registering the Products with the manufacturers for technical support reasons or for Product update reasons the Buyer must typically fill in registration cards and mail them to the manufacturers via post snail mail In the case of software purchased over the internet the buyer if often prompted by the software during its installation to fill in a registration form full of questions. Such online registrations for each software purchased is a chore that Buyers often bypass at the risk of foregoing tech support from the manufacturer.

In general without registering the product purchased Buyers are not likely to receive warranty support or tech support. If Buyers are interested in registering the Product purchased with the manufacturer the Buyer must mail receipts of the Products purchased and sometimes even proofs of purchase such as barcodes along with registration cards to the manufacturer. If a Buyer misplaces either the receipt or the registration card registering the products with the manufacturers is very difficult.

When manufacturers offer rebates on specific Products the Buyer in general must mail in the rebates that apply to the Products purchased. Again mailing in rebates to manufacturers requires an investment of time and energy. For rebates being offered over the internet Sellers must request and collect the information print it and mail it with receipts and sales information for redemption.

The problems related to redemption of rebates are in some ways similar to the problems with the redemption of coupons. Even if buyers can locate coupons for some of the products that they intend to buy on the internet typically there is no easy way to redeem them on internet purchases.

Referring now to quite often manufacturers of products employ several distributors and retailers to sell their products. Often these distributors and retailers have their own internet sales presence and endeavor to sell the manufacturers products on the internet. One of the common problems faced by these distributors and retailers is their inability to assure Buyers of the availability of products whether the product is coming from theirs or the manufacturer s inventory. This causes problems during order fulfillment activities after a Buyer makes a purchase and delay in delivery follows. Manufacturers do not have the ability to determine the sales executed by their various retailers and distributors. This causes the Seller problems in determining production targets.

Often a Seller would want to determine the selling price of specific Products being offered for sale by other online Sellers see e.g. . This however is not easy. Such information may be gathered by visiting the online sales sites of various vendors and browsing or executing queries on each of those sales sites to extract pricing information. This solution does not scale up.

If manufacturers want to control the flow of rebates in an automated way they require information such as the volume of sales from their distributors and retailers. In the online internet based sales environment coupons and rebates dispensed to Buyers cannot be easily tracked and reported especially if the individual distributors and retailers have online sales systems that don t interact with each other and don t communicate information easily as is the situation when they all have heterogeneous sales environments. A related problem is one of determining the sale prices for similar products from different retailers and distributors that sell the same family of products from a manufacturer.

Quite often third party web hosting companies host online sales systems for multiple vendors some of whom might be involved in selling Similar or Same Products see e.g. . If online vendors have to determine prices of similar Products or the same Products sold by their competition it is often difficult to obtain such information in a timely manner even when the competing vendors are hosted by the same web hosting service provider. Among other reasons for this one important reason is the fact that each vendor employs their own proprietary tools and system design to store product information customer information sales information etc.

If a product manufacturer their distributors and retailers each manage their own online sales system then it is difficult for them to correlate similar or the same information contained in each of their systems. If they choose to install and use similar sales systems to alleviate this problem then the distributors and retailers are either constrained to carrying products from that single manufacturer or they are forced to support several such manufacturer specific proprietary sales systems. Therefore in order to minimize the number of such sales systems that they have to support and interact with and yet not limit themselves to a few manufacturers distributors and retailers are often forced to maintain their own individual and customized sales system that is not necessarily tied to any individual manufacturer. By doing so they encounter the problems of correlation of data in their sales systems and in those of the manufacturers.

The Buyer s computer interacts with the MSIS via internet . Similarly the MSIS interacts with the Seller s systems and via internet . Optionally the MSIS may choose to interact with any of the Seller s systems and via a dedicated network or via an intranet.

Typically in response to a Buyer s selection of product categories the MSIS sends queries to one or more Seller s systems to extract product and pricing information from the corresponding Seller s system. In response the Seller s systems typically return shopping carts filled with those Buyer specified products that they are capable of selling along with prices for the products and optionally their inventory of the products.

A Buyer using a Buyer s computer interacts with the MSIS over internet to specify queries related to products that he intends to purchase. Such interactions typically involve navigating down a hierarchy of product categories to identify those that the Buyer is interested in or specifying a search criteria via a search interface to extract information on products and product categories and to identify relevant product categories.

Among other things the MSIS also supports product category selection search query formulation instant coupon and rebate processing shopping cart comparison composite shopping cart review shopping cart pricing and saved quote repricing quote persistence and query persistence scheduled delivery information from Buyers customer profile auto transactions opportunity management and sales agent support automatic registration of products on behalf of Buyers Warranty management. In addition it also includes Sales Bridge software interface that makes it possible to interact with Seller s systems and .

Seller s system comprises a Seller s sales software and a Sales Bridge software . The Seller s Sales software includes a web server software an Application server software and a Sales databases . The Sales Bridge software comprises a Query Bridge and a Transaction Bridge .

The Query Bridge is used to query one or more Sales databases using queries formulated by the MSIS or queries created from search information sent by the MSIS . Information extracted by the Query Bridge is communicated to the MSIS over communication links . The Transaction Bridge is typically employed by the MSIS to conduct credit card based sales transactions with the Seller s system .

Later at a block the MSIS assists Buyers in generating a query for subsequent submission of those queries to Seller s systems. Queries can take the form of old saved quotes or shopping carts coupons selected rebates selected query text third party shopping carts sales brochures persistent queries etc.

Later at a block the MSIS preprocesses Buyer specified queries and delivers them to selected Seller systems that are identified based on one or more search criteria including in some cases product categories customer profiles etc. Some of these queries are selectively cached in memory by the MSIS .

When the Seller s systems respond with product and pricing information for example with priced shopping carts that include all or a subset of the Buyer s product list the MSIS presents the information to Buyer for interaction with the Buyer. Optionally such information is presented as a comparison of products and prices at a block . If a customer s query fails to retrieve results from Seller s systems the MSIS makes a transition to the block .

Otherwise the MSIS continues to a block where it responds to Buyer s selection and acceptance of product prices by interacting with none or more corresponding Seller s systems to complete the sales transactions. Subsequently at a block the MSIS performs post sales functions which selectively include registration warranties updates maintenance contracts opportunity management etc. Opportunity management is employed to generate additional sales or repeat sales.

To interact with the system of the present invention a buyer corporate or individual merely accesses web pages provided by the MSIS with conventional web browser software on the buyer s computer. The buyer interacts with the MSIS to define queries relating to one or more desired products. The MSIS automatically attempts to identify those of the plurality of participating sellers that might carry such products. Once defiled each query is simultaneously communicated by the MSIS to each of Seller s Sales System SSS via the SBS modules of the identified ones of the plurality of participating sellers. Using a query bridging approach each SBS module performs a search of product pricing inventory etc. database s based on the query. All sales information relating to each product identified in the search is delivered to the MSIS for the buyer s review comparison and selection. The MSIS permits concurrent selection and single transaction purchasing of products from more than one seller. Caching of common queries on a day to day basis is also supported by the MSIS to minimize communication overhead.

The sales information returned from each SSS represents complete real time public and private sales information catering not only to individual buyers but more importantly to sellers. For example in response to queries from individual buyers or competitors the query bridge of the present invention may easily be configured to deliver public information such as pricing and product descriptions. For queries generated within a selling channel i.e. by a manufacturer distributor or retailer or by their sales systems private information relating to each product such as inventory inventory projections numbers sold margins etc. may be easily and automatically exchanged. Such information can be used for forecasting inventory pricing planning promotional activities e.g. instant coupons auctioning and rebate programs and production planning for example.

The MSIS supports query definition in several ways to provide the buyer with greatly needed yet currently unavailable functionality. For example through a category selection process and or textual search term entry a buyer can construct a query to simultaneously retrieve from all sellers all underlying product sales information matching the query. The buyer can also generate a query from online rebate and coupon information for true instant processing unlike current online rebate and coupon vendors who incorrectly claim to do the same. Queries may be generated from third party seller shopping carts for comparison with participating sellers products. Saved quotes may be converted to queries for updating and verification and may be used as a persistent basis via sales email for attempting to complete the transaction with the buyer. Further queries may be generated from advertising information e.g. online auction descriptions online sales brochures etc. whether or not such information originates within the MSIS.

Selling channel systems also generate queries in a number of ways with or without interaction through a web client user interface . Automatic data gathering between participants in the selling channel will permit an application based on a toolkit to automatically 1 place or suggest placing orders to replenish inventory 2 identify new product offerings 3 suggest pricing changes 4 facilitate just in time delivery 5 identify and or maintain appropriate inventory levels 6 suggest or carry out changes or additions to advertising and promotional programs 7 schedule release of upgraded or superseding products etc. Competing selling channel systems may also be queried automatically or otherwise to gather public information regarding competing product lines. Such information may be used to supplement the automatic processes identified in items 1 7 above for example. A toolkit underlying the MSIS simplifies preparation of application software to carry out such and other processes. Such application software may run on any or all system s within a sales channel. In fact such application software or portions thereof may be placed at many locations within a single organization to carry out internal enterprise sales functions.

The toolkit underlying the MSIS also provides for up cross and seller to seller opportunity management for automated email based target marketing without the need to release buyer information to a participating seller. For example the MSIS permits a first seller to establish relationships between completed and or queried sales transactions within categories and or by a specified second seller. Based thereon predefined email is automatically sent to buyers or potential buyers advertising sales of the first seller s products that relate to the category or to the second seller s product.

From a buyer s online perspective the MSIS performs a single transaction e.g. credit card processing of multiple product selections spanning more than one seller. Based on final configuration the underlying transaction may actually involve 1 a plurality of transaction processes between each seller and the buyer using the buyer s credit card information and or 2 a single credit card transaction for the total from the buyer to the MSIS along with a plurality of transaction processes with each seller involving account information of the MSIS.

As part of the sales transaction or in follow up thereto the MSIS performs automated registration warranty delivery and acceptance maintenance contract offerings and purchases and emailed product information regarding updates and upgrades services. Stored buyer profiles minimize buyer interaction required to carry out sales transactions and such associated services. Stored buyer transaction records enable targeted email advertising persistent query support opportunity management etc.

The MSIS can upon a seller s request and in addition to or in replacement of the seller s sales system perform transaction and or other sales processing for the seller. In addition the MSIS provides each seller with real time access to product sales information from the seller s competitors and own sales chain. The query protocol and the SBS enable a corporate buyer to develop specifically desired sales interfaces into one or more seller systems. The underlying functionality and software libraries used in the MSIS may be specifically licensed for such purpose. Corporate buyers are also supported through scheduled purchasing and just in time delivery functionality within the MSIS.

The present invention may generate revenue by taking a percentage of each completed sales transaction conducted through the MSIS. To generate further revenue the MSIS tracks each buyer s use of the web site whether or not a transaction is completed and offers to provide sellers with information for potential future sales opportunities. Similarly the System offers instant rebate and coupon processing direct email targeted sales advertising space and persistence in exchange for transaction percentages. Credit card processing delivery tracking customer support and other backend sales functions can be offered generating further revenue streams.

The System may be based on web server and application server software products offered by Trilogy Development Group a company located in Austin Tex.

The SalesBridge Software is placed on each seller s online sales system to bridge communication between the SalePoint software and each seller s online sales databases and applications. Buyers may then simultaneously access many independent and different seller s sales systems. Similarly groups of sellers within one or more sales channels can easily and automatically share sales and product information.

As shown in the SalePoint software will support web based interactive access by buyers and sellers through their web clients and non web based automatic access by the sellers through an interface.

The SalesBridge Software uses both query and transaction bridging functionality to couple each seller s system with the SalePoint software. Alternatively such bridging functionality may be partially or entirely integrated into the seller s system.

For each of the application services transaction logic a high level scripting language is written to include a sequence of tasks that each manipulate data or objects with each of the tasks executed by underlying task specific transaction logic or compiled code hereinafter a workflow object or both. Although transaction logic is specifically written for each of the application services many of the workflow objects and underlying task specific transaction logic are shared by different application services.

Some examples of the application services contemplated by the present invention can be found with reference to below. The tasks executed by the transaction logic engine may include for example credit card related transactions database searches database updates remote transactions executed on one or more seller s systems etc.

The transaction logic engine interacts with several other web server components of the SalePoint Software such as a query generator scheduling component usage tracking management component email component 3rd party web server interface credit card processing interface and a remote transaction handler. The query generator creates queries based on information provided by buyer data retrieved from database s information provided via method invocations from non web server interface etc. The queries generated by the query generator are selectively sent to SalesBridge Software associated with remote Seller s systems to extract various kinds of sales information.

The scheduling component is used to periodically initiate various tasks transaction logic and activities such as reporting or re pricing etc. For example a buyer or seller can schedule various activities and specify when and how frequently they should be executed through associated application services. The schedules and the activities are saved in databases by the scheduling component for subsequent retrieval and execution by the transaction logic engine.

Although usage tracking might have been implemented via transaction logic it is implemented as a separate component to collect process and report information regarding the use of the SalePoint Software by buyers and sellers. The usage tracking component provides information on products sold by various sellers product sales volume type of products being sold inventory information and various other sales related information. The usage tracking component provides information with different levels of granularity as required and authorized by various buyers and sellers.

The management component is used to manage various activities scheduled or unscheduled for buyers and sellers. It is also used to manage initializations application service deployment updates recycling and shutdown of various resources.

The email component is used to send email to one or more buyers or buyer groups after the processing of certain events or after the execution of a scheduled or unscheduled transaction logic command. It is also used to send various information such as for example buyer purchasing and query profiles to sellers and to email promotional material such as coupons and rebates to one or more buyers.

The 3rd party web server interface is used to interact with remote web servers to retrieve or to provide various kinds of information. Using this interface it is possible to interact with remote web servers just like web clients on those web servers.

The credit card processing component is used to interact or conduct transactions with remote credit card processing units. Such remote credit card processing units may be located at seller s environments or incorporated into a seller s system. The credit card processing component enables a buyer to selectively spread purchases over one or more credit cards owned by the buyer and to spread a buyer s shopping cart purchase over several sellers.

The remote transaction handler provides support for interactions with SalesBridge Software installed with one or more remote seller s sales systems. It employs one or more communication mechanisms such as Remote Method Invocation RMI Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA TCPIIP Voyager etc. to communicate with remote software and retrieve information. Remote SalesBridge Software can initiate communications with the SalePoint Software in order to retrieve information provide information or request some service. It also supports communication with external systems such as third party credit card systems and monitoring tools.

The seller s system may also contain the seller s non web applications web based applications and card processing application. The SalesBridge Software may also interact with the seller s applications to extract product pricing and inventory information as well as to conduct credit card based transactions.

If the seller s system includes a web server the SalesBridge Software may also provide a web based application bridge to assist the query bridge in extracting product pricing and inventory information. The query bridge is responsible for mapping or translating queries sent by SalePoint Software into one or more queries executable on the seller s databases to retrieve and possibly update information in the seller s databases.

The SalesBridge Software also provides a non web based application bridge to extract information from the seller s system via the seller s non web applications interface. The non web based application bridge IS employed via an interface supporting remote access based on CORBA RMI etc.

The SalesBridge Software also includes a transaction bridge that can be used to interact with the seller s card processing application to process credit card purchases. For example a buyer s credit card and shopping cart related information may be communicated to the seller s card processing application to complete a transaction for the buyer.

To interact with the SaleBlazer service a buyer merely uses conventional web browser software on the buyer s computer. The buyer interacts to define a query relating to one or more desired products. The SaleBlazer service via the SalePoint Software identifies those of the plurality of participating sellers that might carry such products. Once defined the SalePoint Software simultaneously communicates the query to SalesBridge Software at each of the identified participating sellers.

Using the query and transaction bridging approach of the present invention each SalesBridge Software component performs a search of product pricing inventory etc. databases based on the query. All sales information relating to each product identified in the search is delivered to the SalePoint Software for presentation to the buyer. The buyer may review compare and select one or more of the products returned from one or more of the participating sellers. Caching of common queries on a day to day basis will also be supported by the SaleBlazer service to minimize communication overhead.

From an individual buyer s online perspective the SaleBlazer service will perform a single transaction e.g. credit card processing of multiple product selections spanning more than one seller. Based on final configuration the underlying transaction may actually involve 1 a plurality of transaction processes between each seller and the buyer using the buyer s credit card information and or 2 a single credit card transaction for the total from the buyer to the MSIS along with a plurality of transaction processes with each seller involving account information of the MSIS.

As part of the sales transaction or in follow up thereto the SaleBlazer service will perform automated registration warranty delivery and acceptance maintenance contract offerings and purchases and emailed product information regarding updates and upgrades services. Stored buyer profiles will minimize buyer interaction required to carry out sales transaction and such associated services.

SalesBridge Software on Bidder s System is employed by the MSIS to interact with the bidder s system and periodically update information on the status on bids. In addition the inventory of various products available on the bidder s system is selectively accessed by the MSIS via the SaleBridge.

Requesters using a Requester s Web Client and Bidders using a Bidder s Web Client may interact with the MSIS via an Affiliated Bidding Web App Server which selectively sends Requests or bids to the MSIS and provides information about them to Requesters and Bidders. Similarly 3rd Party Bidding Web App Servers employ the services of the MSIS to save bid related information and to conduct the bid resolution activities. The various participants in the request and bidding process are periodically informed about the status of the bids via email. When bids are decided and the Requester selects a Bidder say a lowest bidder the MSIS facilitates the execution of the transactions to consummate the purchase of the products by the Requester.

In one embodiment the MSIS automatically provides to the Requester a reference bid that comprises lowest bids for individual products from multiple Bidders thereby assembling the lowest total bid to be used whether as a reference or as an actual bid which can be used for purchase by the Requester. Multiple Sellers may be included in such a reference bid. When multiple Bidders are selected by a Requester where each Bidder supplies part of the Request the MSIS facilitates the completion of the purchase by the Request from multiple Bidders.

In general the Integrated Channel Service Manager communicates with SalesBridge Software integrated with individual Seller systems. Specifically the Integrated Channel Service Manager communicates with the SalesBridge Software installed with each of the Seller systems namely the manufacturer environment Reseller A Distributor B and Retailer C.

More specifically the Integrated Channel Service Manager sends queries related to order status inventory levels pricing and product configuration to the manufacturer environment and receives information from the manufacturer environment. It also selectively sends information related to product sales pricing inventory order status etc. retrieved from Reseller A and Distributor B to the manufacturer environment. In addition the Integrated Channel Service Manager facilitates the selective exchange of sales inventory pricing configuration order status etc. between the manufacturer environment the Reseller A Distributor B and Retailer C. Such selective exchange of information between the manufacturer environment Reseller A and Reseller B occurs via the SalesBridge Software integrated with their respective systems under the supervision or control of the Integrated Channel Service Manager.

As discussed above quite often manufacturers of products employ several distributors resellers and retailers to sell their products. Often these distributors and retailers have their own internet sales presence and endeavor to sell the manufacturers products on the internet. One of the common problems faced by these distributors and retailers is their inability to assure Buyers of the availability of products whether the product is coming from their own or the manufacturer s inventory. This causes problems during order fulfillment activities after a Buyer makes a purchase and delay in delivery follows. In general manufacturers do not have the ability to determine the sales executed by their various retailers and distributors. This causes the Seller problems in determining production targets.

These problems are solved by integrating the sales order fulfillment and manufacturing systems of all sellers in the channel as shown for example in . Such integration is facilitated by the Integrated Channel service Manager and the individual SalesBridge Software incorporated in the software of each of the partners in the channel.

Specifically in the manufacturing environment in accordance with the present invention the sales systems of manufacturers and their distributors is integrated with a the order fulfillment systems of the manufacturer and all the resellers and distributors b the inventory management systems of the manufacturer c the pricing systems of the manufacturer s and distributors d the promotion systems of all Sellers and e the Configuration systems of the manufacturer which may be shared by all the distributors and resellers. This makes it possible to not only provide the ability to fulfill orders for an individual Buyer from multiple sellers i.e. one or more distributors and manufacturers but also the ability to incorporate different pricing schemes and promotional schemes in fulfilling the order. In addition such integration makes it possible to incorporate information about the inventory levels of the manufacturer and distributors in determining the delivery date and shipping costs for the Buyer.

In an environment where a manufacturer is not directly involved such as in a sales environment incorporating a large master reseller and their distributors and retailers the sales systems of master resellers and their distributors and retailers is integrated with each Seller s a order fulfillment systems b inventory management systems c pricing systems and d promotion systems to accrue the benefits described in the previous paragraph.

Often a Seller such as a manufacturer desires to determine the selling price of specific Products being offered for sale by other online Sellers and their current inventory levels of those Products especially if the other Sellers are the Seller s own distributors. This however is not easy. Such information may be gathered by visiting the online sales sites of various Sellers distributors and browsing or executing queries on each of those sales sites to extract pricing information. However the integration of the sales systems and inventory management systems of the various distributors and retailers of a Product manufacturer makes it possible for the manufacturer to extract pricing and inventory information from the various distributors and retailers. It is also possible for the manufacturer to not only provide the distributors and retailers with a centrally maintained and shared set of product information and marketing collateral but also provide forecasts of future pricing changes delivery schedules manufacturing schedules and inventory levels.

Another benefit of such integration is the ability to control promotions. For example the integration of sales and inventory systems from multiple sellers such as those of a manufacturer and the manufacturer s distributors and retailers would make it possible to control the flow of promotional offerings coupons rebates etc. in an automated way that would also permit adjusting the promotional offerings dynamically to meet sales targets. In such an integrated environment the adjustments of promotional offerings is driven by several parameters including the volume of sales from the distributors and retailers the product inventory levels at various shelves and warehouses maintained by the manufacturer and distributors the shelf life of the products etc. In the online internet based sales environment the value of coupons and rebates dispensed to Buyers are thus easily tracked altered dynamically.

The integration of sales systems from multiple sellers especially the integration of sales systems of manufacturers and their distributors makes it possible to determine the sale prices for similar products from different retailers and distributors that sell the same family of products from a manufacturer.

The partners of an integrated channel can retrieve configuration related information from the Manufacturer s configuration system via the Integrated Channel Service Manager. Such information may also be selectively cached by the Integrated Channel Service Manager. The same is true for Pricing information. Similarly catalogs of products may be maintained by the manufacturer which are then accessed by the resellers distributors and retailers via the Integrated Channel Service Manager and optionally directly from the manufacturer environment in coordination with the Integrated Channel Service Manager.

The integration of sales order fulfillment inventory management systems pricing systems and promotion systems from various Selling entities that form a part of a manufacturer s channel organization is achieved by a specifying interactions between these systems b identifying information exchange c specifying programming interfaces APIs and protocols for information exchange and d constructing transactional systems that support such interactions based on the protocols.

The interactions between the various systems are expressed as Use Cases and scenarios. The Use Cases also capture details of information exchange. Information exchange is typically expressed in terms of business objects such as Quotes Line Items Shopping Carts Prices Discounts Orders Contracts etc. that are exchanged between systems. The actual transfer of information is carried out in one of two ways 1 using XML based information structures for transfer of structured data between systems or 2 exchanging references to objects that are saved or instantiated in a common data exchange layer that is accessible to all participating systems.

In one embodiment of the present invention the Integrated Channel Service Manager is capable of interacting with Seller s systems manufacturers resellers distributors and retailers employing a SalesBridge Software that is installed on each of the Seller s systems. The SalesBridge Software is used by the Integrated Channel Service Manager to execute queries sent to the Seller s systems from the Integrated Channel Service Manager. The Seller systems of the manufacturers resellers distributors and retailers in response return shopping carts with prices back to the Integrated Channel Service Manager. In general the SalesBridge is used by the Integrated Channel Service Manager as a remote database layer that is capable of translating queries received from the Integrated Channel Service Manager into queries and processes that retrieve the requested information such as configuration pricing and inventory from the Seller s Sales and other software.

The Integrated Channel Service Manager includes one or more web server software components with which Buyers computers interact one or more Application server software components that provide various Sales services to Buyers accessing them over the internet and one or more Sales databases that is used to save various kinds of information such as customer profile saved quotes product categories etc.

Among other things the Integrated Channel Service Manager also supports product category selection search query formulation instant coupon and rebate processing shopping cart comparison composite shopping cart review shopping cart pricing and saved quote re pricing quote persistence and query persistence scheduled delivery information from Buyers customer profile auto transactions opportunity management and sales agent support automatic registration of products on behalf of Buyers and Warranty management. In addition it also includes a SalesBridge Software interface that makes it possible to interact with the Seller s systems.

The Integrated Channel Service Manager activities include identifying potential Sellers for Buyers based on the Buyer s preferences and the actual inventory levels of the Sellers in the Channel In addition it identifies one or more Seller systems in the Channel as potential participants in a sale. Should the Buyer decide to consummate a sale based on the recommendation of Sellers by the Integrated Channel Service Manager the Seller systems participating in the sale are informed of their role in fulfilling the Buyer s order by the Integrated Channel Service Manager. Subsequently the order fulfillment systems of the Sellers are queried by the Integrated Channel Service Manager to retrieve order status information on behalf of the Buyer.

The Integrated Channel Service Manager assists Buyers in generating a query for subsequent submission of those queries to Seller s systems. Queries can take the form of old saved quotes or shopping carts coupons selected rebates selected query text third party shopping carts sales brochures persistent queries etc. The Integrated Channel Service Manager preprocesses Buyer specified queries and delivers them to selected Seller systems that are identified based on one or more search criteria including in some cases product categories customer profiles inventory levels pricing information etc.

When the Seller s systems respond with product and pricing information for example with priced shopping carts that include all or a subset of the Buyer s product list the Integrated Channel Service Manager presents the information to Buyer for interaction with the Buyer. Optionally such information is presented as a comparison of products and prices.

Typically if a Buyer s order cannot be fulfilled by one individual Seller the Integrated Channel Service Manager responds to Buyer s specification of product and pricing selection by interacting with one or more corresponding Seller s systems to complete the sales transactions. Subsequently the Integrated Channel Service Manager performs post sales functions which selectively include registration warranties updates maintenance contracts opportunity management etc. Opportunity management is employed to generate additional sales or repeat sales.

In one embodiment in order to share information in the channel the Integrated Channel Service Manager provides an information exchange layer that is populated with relevant data extracted from each of the participants in the Integrated Channel. Such information is later accessed by other participants under the control and coordination of the Integrated Channel Service Manager. The information exchange layer is implemented using an object oriented database objects of information being transferred to or retrieved from the participants of an Integrated Channel as XML based structured data. In another embodiment the information exchange layer maintained by the Integrated Channel Service Manager is an object oriented layer of software and associated processing software implemented over a relational database.

The Integrated Channel Service Manager thus makes it possible to provide a Buyer with a quote for the set of products the Buyer desires the quote being assembled from information extracted from one or more participants of the Integrated Channel System and including products and prices provided by one or more of such participants. When such a quote is found acceptable by the Buyer and the Buyer places an order based on the quote provided the Integrated Channel Service Manager disassembles the quote to provide relevant portions of the quote to the actual participant selling the product to the Buyer as sub quotes and then forwards the sub quotes to the participants involved. The Integrated Channel Service Manager selectively when required executes credit card processing to execute a single sales transaction for the Buyer that covers all of the sub quotes and thus stands in and executes sales transactions on behalf of all the participants. In addition order status information is retrieved as necessary and when required to enable the Buyer to follow up on the order placed.

In general the Integrated Channel Service Manager communicates with SalesBridge Software integrated with individual Seller systems. Specifically the Integrated Channel Service Manager communicates with the SalesBridge Software installed with each of the Seller systems namely the manufacturer environment Reseller A Distributor B and Retailer C.

More specifically the Integrated Channel Service Manager sends queries related to order status inventory levels pricing and product configuration to the manufacturer environment and receives information from the manufacturer environment. It also selectively sends information related to product sales pricing inventory order status etc. retrieved from Reseller A and Distributor B to the manufacturer environment. In addition the Integrated Channel Service Manager facilitates the selective exchange of sales inventory pricing configuration order status etc. between the manufacturer environment the Reseller A Distributor B and Retailer C. Such selective exchange of information between the manufacturer environment Reseller A Distributor B and Retailer C occurs via the SalesBridge Software integrated with their respective systems under the supervision or control of the Integrated Channel Service Manager.

As discussed above quite often manufacturers of products employ several distributors resellers and retailers to sell their products. Often these distributors and retailers have their own internet sales presence and endeavor to sell the manufacturers products on the internet. One of the common problems faced by these distributors and retailers is their inability to assure Buyers of the availability of products whether the product is coming from their own or the manufacturer s inventory. This causes problems during order fulfillment activities after a Buyer makes a purchase and delay in delivery follows. In general manufacturers do not have the ability to determine the sales executed by their various retailers and distributors. This causes the Seller problems in determining production targets.

These problems are solved by integrating the sales order fulfillment and manufacturing systems of all sellers in the channel as shown for example in . Such integration is facilitated by the Integrated Channel Service Manager and the individual SalesBridge Software incorporated in the software of each of the partners in the channel.

SalesBridge Software in addition to facilitating sales transactions and providing a querying interface also provides support for the following services 

As sales software and the ERP market becomes more mature a critical need arises for tools that allow two communicating systems to query each other and selectively exchange data. An obvious example of this is the scenario where a company is using SAP as their back office system and wishes to make it interact with the SalesBridge Software. An overriding concern for customers will probably be SalesBridge integration with their current system. The front office suite e.g. Multi Seller Interface System MSIS or the Integrated Channel System would need to be able to send quotes configurations pricing details etc. to a seller having SAP for order fulfillment inventory and manufacturing. The main point of integration then becomes the data exchange that needs to take place The SalesBridge Software translates its quote object and its configuration object into the details the SAP system needs and sends those details to the SAP database. In addition the SalesBridge Software translates queries sent by the Integrated Channel System or MSIS into queries that can be executed on the databases or back office systems available at the Seller e.g. the manufacturer reseller distributor or retailer .

SalesBridge MapTool or simply MapTool is a data mapping system or tool. It consists of the three pieces mentioned above 

a a GUI and programmatic events that allow a consultant to map SalesBridge objects to from fields and tables in a foreign database 

b a data transfer engine which at run time connects to the foreign database and allows the actual transfer of information between the two systems and

In addition the SalesBridge Software makes use of some of the artifacts captured by the SalesBridge MapTool to extract information save information and to modify information as necessary in the database or associated software systems at the Seller s environment.

The mapping between the Seller s database or run time systems and the SalesBridge component is performed as follows 

1 The MapTool using JDBC or ODBC or JDBC ODBC based programming api s interacts with the foreign database Seller s database and retrieves schema information using Seller provided username and passwords.

2 The MapTool accesses SalesBridge metadata information from the SalesBridge Software or retrieves them from the MSIS system to identify mapping requirements.

3 The MapTool facilitates the creation of mapping information for mapping the SalesBridge metadata to the Seller s database.

4 It also identifies mapping necessary but not possible so that it may be remedied Via additional tables created in the Seller s and or SalesBridge environment.

5 It also facilitates identification of metadata mapping that is to be supported by programmatically creating mapping code components.

Mapping is used for example for all the following types of information handled by the SalesBridge Software 

While SalesBridge enables the Seller to execute sales inventory and other related activities it is desirable to facilitate the collection processing and archival of such information over time in a Data Warehouse. The SalesBridge Software via its MapTool makes it possible to not only map sales inventory and other related information into a Data Warehouse but also makes it possible to populate such a Data Warehouse with relevant information at run time. This enables the SalesBridge Software to act as an interface to the Data Warehouse for other systems on an Integrated Channel System or an MSIS system.

Data Mining is supported by SalesBridge by providing an ad hoc querying interface to a Data Warehouse that is populated. Such ad hoc querying interface makes it possible for other managers of information in the Integrated Channel system or at the Seller s environment to extract information to enhance their decision making capabilities. In addition third party decision support systems are provided an interface to interact with the Data Mining service.

The partners of an integrated channel can perform Data Mining transactions and retrieve configuration pricing different types of forecasts sales marketing and other related information from the Manufacturer s Data Warehouse using the Data Mining tool. The access to such information is coordinated by the Integrated Channel Service Manager. Such information may also be selectively cached by the Integrated Channel Service Manager. The same is true for access to archived information maintained by the manufacturer at the Data Warehouse. Similarly statistical information on products and sales may be maintained by the manufacturer which is then accessed by resellers distributors and retailers via the Integrated Channel Service Manager the SalesBridge Software and the Data Mining Tool. Optionally a reseller or retailer can directly access such information from the manufacturer environment by interacting with the SalesBridge Software in coordination with the Integrated Channel Service Manager.

The integration of a Data Warehouse and Data Mining tool that forms a part of a manufacturer s channel organization is achieved by a specifying interactions between these systems and the SalesBridge b identifying information exchange c specifying programming interfaces APIs and protocols for information exchange between these systems and the SalesBridge and d constructing transactional systems that support such interactions based on the protocols.

The interactions between the various systems are expressed as Use Cases and scenarios. The Use Cases also capture details of information exchange. Information exchange is typically expressed in terms of business objects such as Quotes Line Items Shopping Carts Prices Discounts Orders Contracts etc. that are exchanged between systems. The actual transfer of information is carried out in one of several ways a using XML based information structures for transfer of structured data between these systems and the SalesBridge Software b exchanging references to objects that are saved or instantiated in a common data exchange layer that is accessible to all participating systems c providing a query interface on the Data warehouse and the Data Mining tool that is accessed by the SalesBridge Software or d providing a set of application programming interfaces using programs written to enable the SalesBridge Software to interact with the Data Warehouse and the Data Mining tool.

The SalesBridge Software is used by the Integrated Channel Service Manager to execute Data Mining queries sent to the Seller s systems from the Integrated Channel Service Manager or from other resellers and retailers in the Channel. The Seller s systems of the manufacturers resellers distributors and retailers in response return the retrieved information if any back to the Integrated Channel Service Manager or to the Seller that sent the query. In general the SalesBridge Software is used by the Integrated Channel Service Manager as a remote database layer that is capable of translating queries received from the Integrated Channel Service Manager into queries and processes that retrieve the requested information from the Data Mining tool or directly from the Data Warehouse.

The SalesBridge Software is used to populate data into the Data Warehouse either directly or via a pipeline of processing software that massages the data before entering it into the Data Warehouse.

In one embodiment of the present invention customers to the web server are presented with lists of products extracted from one or more catalogs or from one or more web content providers such as manufacturers . If the customer selects one or more products from the catalogs or list of products provided by the web server the customer is provided with the option of either purchasing the products selected saving a selection of products preferably as a script or purchasing as well as saving the selection of products. The customer is also provided with the option of downloading the selection of products as a script that can be used to purchase those products at a future time.

If the customer chooses to save the selection of products for subsequent retrieval and purchase the web server saves it as a script in the Script Storage and Execution Environment . Subsequently the customer can establish a new session with the web server to request execution of the saved script by the Script Storage and Execution Environment resulting in the purchase of the product. Alternatively the customer can send an email from the customer s computer to the Script Storage and Execution Environment over the link or via the Internet requesting execution of one or more previously saved scripts. In response the Script Storage and Execution Environment retrieves the saved scripts for the customer and executes the scripts. It also creates a report including the results from the execution of the scripts and sends it to the customer as an acknowledgement.

If the customer elects to interactively purchase the selected products from the web server the customer can consummate the purchase by using a credit card for payment or by accessing a previously established customer account. The customer is then given the option of saving the details of the online sales transactions including the credit card information or customer account used for the sale for a repetition of the sales transaction on another occasion. The customer can selectively retrieve saved sales transaction information in the form of scripts of structured data and download it to the customer s computer .

The web server is used by customers to create customer profiles. A customer profile includes shipping address credit card related information etc. Once a customer profile is created it is used to expedite subsequent customer purchases. Customers who choose not to have a profile created for them may be required to enter their shipping address credit card related information etc. during each purchasing activity.

Customer profiles typically provided by customers during a customer profile generation activity are selectively saved by the web server so that they may be used during the execution of a saved sales transaction script. Such saved customer profiles are then used to complete sales transactions and to ship products after executing saved scripts.

Products are located for purchase either by browsing through several categories of products presented by the web server or by searching for them. In one embodiment of the present invention a customer using the computer and the Internet connection accesses one or more catalogs presented by the web server environment associated with and operatively coupled to the Script Storage and Execution Environment . The customer then activates a purchase button to purchase the products selected. In response the web server creates a transaction script and communicates the transaction script to the Script Storage and Execution Environment via connection . The Script Storage and Execution Environment completes a purchase order for the customer incorporating all the products selected by the customer and optionally applying all applicable rebates and coupons based on the transaction script. Also based on the transaction script it performs order fulfillment operations aimed at assigning products from the inventory of one or more manufacturers or retailers or distributors not shown to the customer.

In one embodiment the inventory of some of the products purchasable from the web server are selectively maintained by the manufacturer merchant environment . For such products to perform order fulfillment activities the Script Storage and Execution Environment interacts with the manufacturer merchant environment over the connection in one of two approaches. In the first approach the manufacturer merchant environment receives purchase orders or purchase order scripts to some products currently available in their inventory from the Script Storage and Execution Environment in order to perform order fulfillment for the customer. The manufacturer merchant environment executes the received script or processes the purchase order to perform order fulfillment. To provide the customer profile to the manufacturer merchant environment the customer s profile or a subset thereof is made visible or is sent to the manufacturer merchant environment which then ships the products to the customer. In a second approach the Script Storage and Execution Environment executes the script representing the customer s sales transaction in its environment and interacts with the manufacturer merchant environment to retrieve order fulfillment information and to convey shipping information.

In addition to sales transaction scripts customers may create order status scripts report generation scripts etc. and save them in the Script Storage and Execution Environment . Such scripts may subsequently be executed at the web server. They may also be sent to the manufacturer environment for execution. The manufacturer environment can be made capable of executing scripts by incorporating an instance of the Script Storage and Execution Environment within its environment.

In another embodiment the manufacturer is capable of saving and or executing saved sales transaction scripts or other scripts sent to it by the web server . Such scripts are executed by the manufacturer environment and the results of the execution are selectively communicated to the web server and to the customer using the computer .

Customers can create and save scripts at the Script Storage and Execution Environment specifying their preferred vendor list product preferences accounting preferences payment methods reporting preferences etc. Such scripts are subsequently accessed by the Script Storage and Execution Environment during the execution of sales transaction scripts.

In one embodiment the web server serves as a front end to the e commerce sites of manufacturers and merchants wherein customers purchase products from the web server and pay for the products purchased via credit cards. The web server in turn acquires the products purchased by the customer from customer designated suppliers via scripts such as manufacturers distributors or retail merchants. A supplier is selected based on customer s profile the saved scripts indicating the customer s preferred vendor list the product category the inventories of products at the various suppliers the business arrangements made by the customers or by the owners of the web server with various suppliers and other criteria. In effect one or more suppliers sells the products to the web server which uses the Script Storage and Execution Environment to execute the sales transactions and to save such sales transactions information.

In one embodiment the web server sends promotional material via email to customers and attaches a script associated with the purchase of the products being promoted. The customer selectively edits the attached script and emails it back to the web server . The web server selectively forwards the received script attachments to the Script Storage and Execution Environment for execution. The Script Storage and Execution Environment selectively executes the scripts and collects the results of the execution to the web server and to the customer.

In a similar embodiment the customer sends an email to an email address associated with the web server . The email includes a script that extracts product and pricing information from the web server and specifies a destination for the extracted information. The web server receives the email and the script via the associated email address forwards the script to the Script Storage and Execution Environment and sends an acknowledgement email to the customer. The Script Storage and Execution Environment executes the script received from the customer and extracts the required information and forwards it to the destination specified by the customer in the script.

In one embodiment of the present invention the script executed by the Script Storage and Execution Environment comprises one or more of the commands supported by the PANINI Language presented in the Appendix A. In this embodiment customers email scripts written in the PANINI Language to the web server or directly to the Script Storage and Execution Environment for execution. In addition the web server creates scripts in the PANINI language specifying sales transactions from online customers and sends it to the Script Storage and Execution Environment for execution.

In another embodiment of the present invention a scripting language other than the PANINI language is employed by customers the web server and the Script Storage and Execution Environment . The Script Storage and Execution Environment may be incorporated into the web server or into a manufacturer s environment .

The script saving and execution engine is used to execute scripts received from customers manufacturers merchants and those retrieved from script repository such as a database. The email server interface is used to retrieve scripts sent as email from customers manufacturers and merchants. It is also used to send email to customers manufacturers and merchants along with attachments of scripts or reports. The email server interface provides an interface that is used to communicate with mail servers such as SMTP servers POP mail servers and IMAP servers.

Online customers interact with the scripting execution environment via communication links . Online customers can download scripts from the scripting execution environment . They can also communicate scripts to the scripting execution environment for execution. Similarly manufacturers and online merchant environments interact with the scripting execution environment via communication links .

Customers are presented with a catalog of products to choose from by the web server associates with the online sales and pricing system when they visit the online sales and pricing system . If the customer selects one or more products from the catalog or list of products available at the online sales and pricing system they are provided with the option of purchasing the products.

If the customer elects to purchase the selected products from the online sales and pricing system all applicable rebates and coupons are applied to the customer s purchases by the online sales and pricing system in the determination of a final purchase price for the customer. The customer can consummate the purchase by using a credit card for payment. The online sales and pricing system processes customer s credit cards for sales processing. Corporate customers are allowed to open an account with the online sales and pricing system that will permit them to purchase products online and settle their accounts periodically.

Customer profiles typically provided by customers during a customer profile generation activity is selectively used by the online sales and pricing system to complete sales transactions and to ship products. Customer profile includes shipping address credit card related information etc. Once a customer profile is created it is used to expedite subsequent customer purchases. Customers who choose not to have a profile created for them may be required to enter their shipping address credit card related information etc. during each purchasing activity.

In one embodiment of the present invention a customer using the computer and the Internet connection accesses one or more catalogs presented by a server environment associated with and connectively coupled to the online sales and pricing system . In this embodiment the customer would optionally retrieve product information on one or more products that the customer plans to purchase by browsing through several categories of products presented by the online sales and pricing system . The customer then activates a purchase button to purchase the products selected. The online sales and pricing system completes a quote containing a price for the customer incorporating all the products selected by the customer and optionally applying all applicable rebates and coupons. If the customer agrees to the quote the quote is converted into a purchase order for the customer.

The quote and the purchase order would therefore include prices that are determined by incorporating the schedule of delivery optionally provided by the customer. The computation of the prices for the products would also involve information on the forecasted prices for the products acquired from one or more online futures trading systems. For some products such forecasted pricing information is accessed from the manufacturers.

In one embodiment forecasted pricing information for both the short term and the long term of some of the products purchasable from the online sales and pricing system are selectively maintained by the online futures trading system . For such products to perform pricing activities the online sales and pricing system interacts with the online futures trading system over the connection in one of two approaches. In the first approach the online futures trading system receives a list of products from the online sales and pricing system in order to provide futures related forecasted prices. The online futures trading system then returns the forecasted prices to the online sales and pricing system . The returned forecasted prices are used by online sales and pricing system in determining the prices for the products purchased by the customer.

In the second approach the online sales and pricing system requests live data or periodically delivered data on various products from one or more futures trading systems and processes such received futures related information in order to calculate the product prices for the quotes and purchase orders of online customers.

The determination of the total purchase order price involves identification of delivery schedules for each of the products on the purchase order and the calculation of prices for those products using the forecasted prices derived from futures information provided by the online futures trading systems. In forecasting the price of a product in the future sources of information other than online future trading systems may also be selectively employed.

In one embodiment the online sales and pricing system serves as a front end to the e commerce sites of manufacturers and merchants wherein customers purchase products from the online sales and pricing system and reimburse it say via credit cards for the products purchased online. The online sales and pricing system in turn acquires the products purchased by the customer from designated suppliers such as manufacturers distributors or retail merchants. A supplier is selected based on the product category the inventories of products at the various suppliers the business arrangements made with various suppliers and other criteria. In effect the supplier sells the products to the online sales and pricing system which ensures the pricing of products in a customer s purchase order based on their delivery schedules and the forecasted prices for the various products. The online sales and pricing system selectively charges the suppliers a transaction fee for generating their business. The customer is also selectively made to pay a service charge to the online sales and pricing system for its services.

To submit online information on forecasted prices of products to the online sales and pricing system so that they can be used to determine purchase prices for customers one or more online futures trading systems establish connections with the online sales and pricing system . In some embodiments the connection is the internet.

The online sales and pricing system of may receive pricing forecasts categorized by geographic region where they apply. Some of the pricing forecast information presented to the online sales and pricing system from information providers such as the online futures trading system may selectively be encrypted for subsequent decryption and processing by the online sales and pricing system .

In general pricing quotes for products purchase and the price forecasts that they are based on may be selectively saved by customers for subsequent processing. The online futures trading system may choose not to honor coupons that have expired.

In another embodiment the pricing and forecasting information dispensed by information providers such as the online futures trading system and received by the online sales and pricing system is generated in eXentisible Manipulation Language XML format. Such XML formatted forecasting information sent by the online futures trading system is processed by the online sales and pricing system .

When customers decide to purchase products from the online sales and pricing system the pricing manager provides pricing functionality that incorporates calculation of prices based on several factors including the customer s schedule of product delivery and the forecast of prices provided by pricing forecast providers . The pricing manager also includes a credit card processing unit that processes customer sales that are based on credit cards and a pricer database employed to store pricing related data. An order fulfillment manager provides information on available inventory of products. If a product purchased by a customer is not in stock or not stored locally at the online sales and pricing system the order fulfillment manager makes it possible to purchase that product from the manufacturer distributors or merchants. Such purchases are done in one of two ways seamlessly where the customer does not realize that the product is being acquired from a manufacturer or merchant or explicitly where the customer is aware of the participation of a manufacturer or merchant in the fulfillment of his purchase order.

Online Customers access the online sales and pricing system over the connection . They can browse through the online browsable catalog of products and services or search for a specific product or service based on criteria such as product category geographical region brand names etc. Pricing forecast providers access the online sales and pricing system over the connection .

In a similar embodiment of the present invention quote generation is performed by the electronic commerce software of a manufacturer or online merchant to which a customer migrates to from the browsable indexed coupon selection software along with a shopping cart with one or more selected products a delivery schedule for the products and forecasted prices for the products corresponding with their delivery schedule. This implies that a customer can consummate. a purchase of a product at a merchant or manufacturer s e commerce site following the selection of products from the online sales and pricing system and subsequent vectoring with pricing forecasts and delivery schedule to the e commerce site.

Quotes created by the online sales and pricing system may be printed by customers for tracking of the delivery of the products. The printing is facilitated by a print engine that is either available at the customer s computer or can be easily downloaded to the customer s computer.

In one embodiment the online sales and pricing system provides insurance to customers via an insurance company for optionally insurance against losses occurring from an overestimated quote which by the time of delivery per the customer s schedule is worth substantially less than the purchasing price of the quote. In another embodiment the online sales and pricing system dispenses refunds or coupons for subsequent purchases to those customers based on the price difference between the actual sales price taking into account the actual prices of the purchased products at delivery time and the quoted sales price for the products. The coupons may be redeemed by the customers during subsequent online purchases at the online sales and pricing system .

To facilitate location of products by a customer in one embodiment the online sales and pricing system provides a web interface where products are categorized into different product categories. A customer browses using a web browser through categories and sub categories of products to locate and purchase one or more products. The online sales and pricing system also categorizes products by manufacturers and merchants. If a customer purchases one or more products on the online sales and pricing system the rebates and coupons if any are automatically applied to the final price for the customer.

Internet portals such as Yahoo and internet web services such as internet service providers ISPs can provide an automatic connection to the online sales and pricing system so as to provide their readers information on available products including forecasted prices for the short or long term associated with one or more products on the currently displayed web page. Alternatively these portals can route web browsers automatically to the online sales and pricing system to retrieve associated pricing information if necessary say in a pop up screen or frame automatically created by the currently visible web page provided by the portal. Thus readers of web content provided by web page hosts and portals can retrieve forecasted prices for short term and or long term while they browse product information.

The online sales and pricing system makes it possible to integrate purchasing with software registration and product surveys. Customers who buy and install software are often reluctant to register them with the vendor. This situation is true for other types of products too. In order to provide an incentive for registration of products the manufacturers or vendors of such products can integrate the online sales and pricing system with the registration process so that customers might be enticed with coupons for their next purchases.

In general delivery schedules are provided by the customer to determine pricing based on proposed consumption rate consumption schedule or deployment plans of the products. Refunds or coupons are optionally provided to customers if the quoted price is significantly greater than the actual selling price.

Although a system and method according to the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment it is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein but on the contrary it is intended to cover such alternatives modifications and equivalents as can be reasonably included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by this disclosure and appended diagrams.
