These aspects of the invention are not meant to be exclusive and other features aspects and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art when read in conjunction with the appended claims and accompanying drawings.

In various embodiments a system and method for battery charging is included. In various embodiments a system may include at least one internal battery and at least one external battery. However in some embodiments the system may include at least one external battery but no internal battery. In still other embodiments the various embodiments of the system may include one or more external batteries. In various embodiments the internal battery is located inside a device which in some embodiments may include a prosthetic device. The at least one internal battery in some embodiments may not be readily accessible and or directly accessible by a user. For example in some embodiments the at least one internal battery may be located in the device such that the battery housing is waterproof and or protected from the outer environment and therefore not accessible unless a plate and or a battery cap and or other is first removed. In various embodiments the at least one internal battery may be a rechargeable battery and therefore in some embodiments it may be desirable to recharge the battery from an external source rather than removing the not readily available internal battery to recharge the internal battery. In some embodiments where the at least one internal battery may be readily accessible it may be desirable to recharge the internal battery from at least one external source. In some embodiments the at least one external source may include but is not limited to one or more of the following at least one external battery and or at least one AC adapter. In some embodiments the at least one AC adapter may be a medical grade AC adapter for example a 60 watt XP Power AC adapter model number AFM60 made by XP Power Limited Singapore. In some embodiments the AC adapter may be 24 VDC. However in various embodiments a different AC adapter or other adapter or outside charging device may be used. In some embodiments the at least one AC adapter may be connected to the device to charge the at least one internal battery by connection to a charging port. In some embodiments where the device is a prosthetic arm device the charging port may be located anywhere on the device including but not limited to on the forearm.

In some embodiments the internal battery may be a 4S1P lithium ion rechargeable 18650 cells battery for a nominal voltage of 14.8 VDC having 2 amp hours of capacity. However in various other embodiments the internal battery may be a larger or smaller voltage with more or less capacity. In some embodiments the at least one internal battery may include a SMBus gas gauge IC and protection circuitry.

In some embodiments the system may include no external batteries. However in some embodiments the system may include at least one external battery. In some embodiments the at least one external battery may be used to power a device for example but not limited to a prosthetic device. In some embodiments the at least one external battery may be used to recharge an internal battery in a device. For example in some embodiments the at least one external battery may be used to recharge a non removable internal battery in a device. In some embodiments the at least one external battery may be a 4S2P lithium ion rechargeable 18650 cells battery for a nominal voltage of 14.8 VDC and 5 amp hours of capacity. In some embodiments the at least one external battery may include a SMBus gas gauge IC and protection circuitry. In some embodiments the system may include one external battery and in some embodiments the system may include two or more external batteries. In some embodiments the at least one external battery may be worn by a user by attaching the external battery to a holster a belt holster a pack or other apparatus to secure the external battery to the user. In some embodiments the external battery is connected to a device for example but not limited to a prosthetic device by an electric connector for example a cable.

In some embodiments where at least one external battery is used a power button may be located on the holster or other holder of the external battery. In an exemplary embodiment the holster may be configured to include a pushbutton holster e.g. in some embodiments this embodiment may be used when there is no internal battery or a non pushbutton holster e.g. in some embodiments this embodiment may be used when there is at least one internal battery . In some embodiments where both at least one internal battery and at least one external battery are included in the system the internal battery includes an internal battery interface. In these embodiments software is common to both the internal battery interface and the holster and configuration jumpers on the board may be read by the software to determine the type of board.

In various embodiments the system may include a device including but not limited to a medical device e.g. a prosthetic device or prosthetic arm at least one internal battery and at least one external battery. In some embodiment of this embodiment the system may include at least two external batteries. In some embodiments all the batteries may include built in circuits for measuring state of charge and protection against faults. In some embodiments one or more batteries may include built in circuits for measuring state of charge and protection against faults. In some embodiments similar to other smart batteries the batteries may communicate this information to the system using the System Management Bus SMBus hardware software protocol. In some embodiments the at least one or at least two external batteries are charged by an external battery charger.

In some embodiments as discussed above a holster may be included wherein the holster accepts and secures the external battery. Referring now also to one embodiments of a battery interface view into holster or charger is shown. In various embodiments when one external battery is mounted in the holster spring contacts in the holster mate to metal pads on the external battery which interfaces the battery to the device s e.g. prosthetic arm s power and communication busses. The external battery charger duplicates the holster s interface to the battery for both supplying charge power and for SMBus communication.

Referring also to one embodiment of a holster and an external battery is shown. Referring also to in some embodiments a charger may accommodate one or more external batteries . In the embodiment shown in the charger accommodates two external batteries .

In some embodiments the external battery charger may be designed to charge up to two external batteries simultaneously. In some embodiments for ease of use the external batteries may be loaded vertically like a toaster relying on the battery s weight in some embodiments to create sufficient force to connect with the electrical contacts. In some embodiments the external batteries may include a keying feature i.e. they may be keyed to prevent being inserted backwards. In some embodiments each charger bay may have a dedicated charge circuit both of which in some embodiments may be overseen by a microcontroller with custom software.

In some embodiments bulk power may be supplied to the battery charger by an off the shelf medical grade power supply that produces 24 VDC. In some embodiments this power may be the AC adapter described above i.e. the same power supply that may be used to provide charge power to the device.

In some embodiments the external battery charger is a Level 3 charger by the definitions of the Smart Battery System specification. Thus the charger s microcontroller acts as the SMBus master and queries each battery for its desired charging current and terminal charging voltage. The microcontroller forwards this information to the charge circuits. The microcontroller may provide the full requested charge power or limit one or both batteries to avoid exceeding the rating of the power supply. Through the SMBus interface the charger may also be able to query the external batteries status and use this information to determine if a fault has occurred.

The interactions among the external batteries the charge circuits and the microcontroller are complex. In general the software and hardware are architected to disable power to the charging circuits by default. In some embodiments only when a number of predetermined conditions are met for example but not limited to one or more of the following charge voltage in acceptable range battery is present and communicating battery reports no faults requested charge current in acceptable range etc. will charge power be applied.

Referring now also to a system block diagram of one embodiment of the battery system for a device is shown. As discussed above in some embodiments various embodiments of the battery system may be used with a prosthetic device including but not limited to a prosthetic arm. However in various embodiments the various embodiments of the battery system may be used with any device requiring power. For purposes of illustration only some embodiments of the system are described with reference to a prosthetic arm. However this is for descriptive purposes only and it should be understood that the system is not limited to use with a prosthetic arm. In various other embodiments the components described below with reference to a prosthetic arm e.g. shoulder ACM stack may be different where the system is used in conjunction with a device other than a prosthetic arm device.

Referring now also to and diagrams of two embodiments of the internal battery interface are shown. In some embodiments where the system includes an internal battery and at least one external battery the internal battery connects to a custom circuit board called the internal battery interface. This board contains a microcontroller that talks e.g. on a CAN bus as a slave to a master controller. The board also has a charging circuit for the internal battery. The charging circuit is powered in some embodiments from either an external VDC power source like from an AC adapter or from the system power bus getting power from the external battery . Because in some embodiments the 24 VDC AC adapter interface connector may be a common barrel connector to reduce and or eliminate the possibility that a user might connect the wrong voltage AC adapter and to protect against the wrong voltage or polarity AC adapter from affecting the internal battery interface electronics in some embodiments circuitry may be incorporated into the internal battery interface board to tolerate a range of AC adapter input voltages for example including but not limited to a range from 36 VDC to 36 VDC. In various other embodiments this range may be different. In some embodiments the voltage range may be determined by conducting a search of commonly available AC adapters with similar output connectors.

In some embodiments the internal battery interface circuitry may include a soft power interface controller. In some embodiments this controller monitors the power on off button and helps to control system power. In some embodiments the microcontroller also participates in this functionality however the soft power controller may in some embodiments independently shut off the system power if the microcontroller fails to respond to power off requests.

Referring now also to and diagrams of two embodiments of the external battery interface with a holster are shown.

In some embodiments the external battery connects to another custom circuit board in the external battery holster which is described in more detail below. In some embodiments the schematic for the external battery holster board may be similar to the schematic of the internal battery interface board. In some embodiments the schematic for the external battery holster board may be different from the internal battery interface board. In some embodiments the external battery holster contains a microcontroller that talks e.g. on a CAN bus as a slave to the master controller and it talks to the internal battery over a SMBus.

In some embodiments the external battery interface circuitry includes a soft power interface controller. In some embodiments this controller monitors the power on off button and helps to control system power. As with the internal battery interface board in some embodiments the microcontroller may also play a part in this functionality however the soft power controller may independently shut off the system power should the microcontroller fail to respond to one or more power off requests. In some embodiments the soft power controller in the holster is only installed when there is a pushbutton in the holster .

Referring now also to a system schematic of one embodiment of the system is shown. In this embodiment the system includes an internal battery and at least one external battery. Again referring to a prosthetic arm for illustration purposes inside the prosthetic forearm in some embodiments an internal battery circuit board is located next to the internal battery. The internal battery circuit board includes a microcontroller that communicates with the internal battery including communications related to the charge of the internal battery. In addition in some embodiments the microcontroller communicates with the prosthetic arm systems communication bus CAN Bus which communicates with the master controller. The master controller therefore in various embodiments receives information about the battery which may include but is not limited to the amount of charge in the battery. The master controller can make decisions regarding when to charge the internal battery and also when to switch between the external battery and the internal battery for powering the device e.g. the prosthetic arm. The external battery also has an interface board with a microcontroller that communicates to the external battery and the arm system s communications bus CAN bus which communicates with the master controller. In some embodiments a cable connects the external battery to the arm device system. The power from the external battery may also power the arm device.

In some embodiments the internal battery circuit board includes a smart charger circuit that may either accept input power from the AC adapter or from the arm system power bus thus charging the internal battery from the external battery. In some embodiments the power from the power bus which comes from the external battery is boosted to a higher voltage for input to the smart charger.

The following are various methods that may be applied by the system to determine where to take power from e.g. which battery to take power from to power the device. These are not limiting factors and additional alternative factors may be used in various embodiments. In some embodiments one or more of the following are not used.

In some embodiments whenever there is an external battery connected to the system the master controller decides that the external battery powers the bus and therefore disconnects the internal battery from the power bus.

In some embodiments when the external battery remaining capacity goes below a preset predetermined preprogrammed threshold the master controller may automatically command the internal battery to switch to power the bus.

In some embodiments alerts and warnings may be displayed to the user for example using a user interface on the device if the installed battery i.e. the combined remaining capacity of all installed batteries is below a preset predetermined preprogrammed threshold. Thus in various embodiments to determine the combined capacity total capacity of all installed batteries the total capacity of all internal batteries and any external battery connected to the system is used.

In some embodiments where there is an internal battery and the device system first powers on the system may always be initially powered by the internal battery until the master controller determines how many batteries are connected for example whether there is an external battery present.

In some embodiments once the device power is turned on the main computer master controller determines whether there is an external battery present. If there is an external battery present but if it is not connected the master controller will allow the internal battery to power the bus.

However in some embodiments once the master controller determines that there is an external battery present the master controller determines if the external battery has enough capacity i.e. the external battery capacity exceeds a predetermine preset preprogrammed threshold and if so connects the external battery to the power bus and disconnects the internal battery from the power bus.

In some embodiments the interface board near the internal battery may monitor the status of that internal battery to determine whether the internal battery needs to be charged i.e. whether the capacity of the internal battery is less than a preset preprogrammed predetermined threshold. When an external battery is present and has greater than a preset predetermined preprogrammed threshold of remaining capacity then in some embodiments the interface board may begin charging the internal battery using the external battery.

In some embodiments connecting the AC adapter to the device takes priority over charging the internal battery from the external battery. This may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to preserving the power that is in the external battery.

In some embodiments the external battery which in some embodiments is also rechargeable may be required to be removed disconnected from the device and or from the holster to be charged. Thus in some embodiments the external batteries will not recharge if connected to the device arm.

As described above some embodiments of the system include an external battery holster . In these embodiments the external battery holster may include contacts that allow the external battery to be unclipped from the holster . In some embodiments the holster may have a microcontroller in some embodiments having a microcontroller when the external battery is taken off the holster or is not connected to the holster the device system may determine that the holster is still connected but that the external battery is no longer connected to the holster . In some embodiments where the device previously determined that two batteries an internal and an external are connected the device can determine that the external battery has been disconnected. In some embodiments when the external battery is disconnected from the holster the device arm may automatically switch over to use the internal battery to power the device arm. In some embodiments the system may determine that the external battery is disconnected by monitoring the falling voltage.

In some embodiments when the system first turns on the circuit in the interface circuit closes and powers the bus. Then the master controller sees the external battery and turns the holster on and the interface circuit off and then the external battery powers the bus.

In some embodiments when the external battery is disconnected from the holster the external battery may reach a preset predetermined preprogrammed hot swap threshold voltage and the system may then turn on the internal battery interface circuit and turn off the holster external battery interface circuit.

Next in some embodiments if a new for example charged external battery is inserted into the holster the holster interface knows that an external battery has been connected to the system and in some embodiments the master computer then turns the holster external interface circuit on and the internal battery interface circuit off.

Thus in some embodiments the system includes a method and system for hot swapping a battery power source that is powering a device. In some embodiments for example having a device including at least one internal battery and two external batteries where the device is powered by the external battery and the system determines that the external battery becomes disconnected the system may continue regular operation by turning the external interface circuit off and the internal interface circuit on thereby continuously powering the device. Then when for example the external battery is connected again to the system device the system recognizes that the external battery is again connected and turns the internal interface circuit off and the external interface circuit on thereby the device is powered again by the external battery.

In some embodiments this method may be used to hot swap a first external battery for a second external battery. In some embodiments these may be beneficial for changing external batteries when one external battery s charge has depleted and a second external battery is more charged than the first. For example in some embodiments where the first external battery has been powering the device for a threshold period of time which may be close to the maximum use a user may hot swap the first external battery for a second external battery which may be in some embodiments fully charged. This may be beneficial for continuously powering the device without interruption.

In some embodiments for example in embodiments where the system is used with a medical device for example a prosthetic device which may include a prosthetic arm the system allows for functionality of the device arm using an internal battery which may be supplemented by an external battery. Therefore for example where a user may be dressing undressing using the internal battery during this time allows for arm functionality without being tethered to an external battery by a cable. The tethering and or cable may make tasks for example dressing undressing more difficult. However this system allows for use of an external battery which may have longer use per charge and also for a hot swap of the external battery. The system also includes the ability to recharge the internal battery using the external battery which provides for a system of assuring the user that the internal battery will be charged when next needed for example if morning tasks depleted the internal battery charge by 75 once connected to the external battery for example during the daytime hours the internal battery will be recharged to 100 from the external battery. Then for evening tasks for example which may include those tasks that are more convenient to accomplish without a tether to an external battery the internal battery will be available charged. This system is advantageous for many reasons including but not limited to providing ease of recharging the internal battery continuous use of the device even while swapping power sources and allowing for use of the device arm for tasks where being tethered or having cables may inhibit make difficult one s ability to complete the desired tasks efficiently and or with ease. In various embodiments the AC adapter may be used for example overnight to charge the internal battery while the charger may be used to charge the one or more external batteries.

In various embodiments the user interface on the device may indicate to the user the charge status of the one or more batteries i.e. internal and or external battery connected to the device arm. For example in some embodiments the wrist display may indicate the total amount of remaining capacity which is calculated based on the total batteries connected to the system e.g. in some embodiments 1 battery or 2 batteries. Therefore in these embodiments if 2 batteries are connected to the system the battery indicator adds the total capacity of both batteries and determines the remaining capacity. Thus for example if no external battery was connected to the device and the internal battery is 100 charged the user interface may indicate that the charge is 100 . However if an external battery is then connected to the system and it is not itself 100 charged the user interface battery indicator may indicate less than 100 taking into consideration the amount of charge remaining on both batteries. Thus this may be advantageous for many reasons including but not limited to the system reporting an accurate remaining capacity to the user taking into consideration all the batteries connected to the device.

Although this system has been described with respect to prosthetic devices in some embodiments the system may be used in any device including but not limited to those devices where the internal rechargeable battery is not user replaceable or where the internal rechargeable battery is difficult to replace and or remove to recharge. In some embodiments the system may be used on any device that is a portable continuous duty system where it is desirable that the device continuously be powered on to perform one or more tasks. In some embodiments the system may be used with a medical device.

In various embodiments the hot swap described above may be used once an external battery is disconnected and an AC adapter is connected. Thus once the system determines that the external battery is disconnected the system switches to using the internal battery. Following once the AC adapter is connected to the device the system switches to using the AC adapter to charge the internal battery. Also where the AC adapter is currently connected and is then disconnected and an external battery is connected the internal battery will be charged from the external battery.

The system may be used in many devices including but not limited to infusion pumps monitoring device and other device having a high duty cycle. The various embodiments of the systems includes one or more power sources which may include one or more but not limited to the following AC adapter rechargeable battery internal to the device rechargeable battery external to the device and where one of these power sources is powering the device another of these power sources may be connected to the device and henceforth power the device. Additionally one or more of the power sources may recharge one or more of the other power sources for example an external battery may recharge an internal battery and or an AC adapter may recharge an internal battery. In some embodiments while the device is currently in use and powered by an external device the external device may also provide charge to an internal battery to recharge the internal battery.

Thus in some embodiments of the system the external battery not only runs the device but also recharges the internal battery at the same time and can swap out the external battery for with a second external battery when the first external battery s charge is depleted. All of these may be accomplished while the device is fully powered in a continuous uninterrupted manner.

In various embodiments the system may be advantageously used in devices where it may be beneficial for the device not to be plugged in and or not be tethered for example but not limited to laptops and or surgical devices.

In some embodiments the system may be advantageous in devices where removing the internal battery may interrupt the ongoing use of the device and or trigger a start up process which would interrupt the performance of a device.

In some embodiments the system may include methods for hot swapping two or more batteries that may be user accessible. For example the system may include a first battery and a second battery. The first battery may be 100 charged and the second battery may be 50 charged or in various embodiments the first battery may be more charged than the second. The first battery may charge the second battery while the first battery powers a device. Thus in some embodiments a first battery may serve as a charger battery and a second battery may serve as a charged battery. In some embodiments once the first battery charger battery is depleted of its charge to a preset threshold predetermined preprogrammed level the second battery charged battery may be swapped out automatically such that the second battery charged battery is now running the device and first battery charger battery is being recharged by the second battery. Thus the first battery and the second battery swap tasks. Thus in some embodiments this method provides that one battery is always more charged than a second battery and therefore the device may be continuously powered without interruption and or without restarting and or starting up processes.

In some embodiments the various hot swap methods may include methods for increasing the life of the battery by not exceeding a preset predetermined minimum charge e.g. 50 . In some embodiments the system may favor maintaining the internal battery at a charge as high as possible.
