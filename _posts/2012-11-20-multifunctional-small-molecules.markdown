This application is a 371 U.S. National Phase Entry of pending International Patent Application No. PCT US2012 066104 International Filing Date Nov. 20 2012 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 568 521 filed Dec. 8 2011 the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with government support under W911NF 07 1 0437 awarded by the U. S. Army Research Office. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to dendrimer synthesis. Specifically the present invention relates to dendrimer compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of copper free click conjugation for use in the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of use of the same.

Cancer remains the number two cause of mortality in the United States resulting in over 500 000 deaths per year. Despite advances in detection and treatment cancer mortality remains high. New compositions and methods for the imaging and treatment e.g. therapeutic of cancer may help to reduce the rate of mortality associated with cancer.

Severe chronic pain is observed on a variety of subjects. For example there exist large numbers of individuals with severe pain associated with arthritis autoimmune disease injury cancer and a host of other conditions.

There exists a need for compositions methods and systems for delivering agents e.g. diagnostic and or therapeutic e.g. cancer therapeutics pain relief agents to subjects that provide effective therapy e.g. disease treatment symptom relief etc. with reduced or eliminated side effects even when administered in high doses. Functionalized dendrimers such as PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with functional ligands relevant to cancer therapy and or pain alleviation have been developed for such purposes. However multi step conjugation strategies used to attach different functional groups to the surfaces of nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers PAMAM dendrimer branches introduce higher polydispersity and require multiple processing steps thereby complicating synthesis. In addition increased polydispersity of functionalized dendrimer products can negatively affect properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting.

Improved methods of synthesis of dendrimers resulting in decreased polydispersity are needed. In particular compositions and methods that facilitate copper free click conjugation for use in the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers are needed.

The present invention relates to dendrimer synthesis. Specifically the present invention relates to dendrimer compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of copper free click conjugation for use in the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of use of the same.

The present invention is not limited to utilizing a particular type or form of dendrimer. Indeed examples of dendrimers finding use in the present invention include but are not limited to PAMAM dendrimer a Baker Huang PAMAM dendrimer see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 251 244 and International Patent Application No. PCT US2010 051835 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety a polypropylamine POPAM dendrimer and a PAMAM POPAM dendrimer. The type of dendrimer used is not limited by the generation number of the dendrimer. Dendrimer molecules may be generation 0 generation 1 generation 2 generation 3 generation 4 generation 5 generation 6 generation 7 or higher than generation 7. In some embodiments half generation dendrimers may be used. In some embodiments the dendrimer is at least partially acetylated.

In certain preferred embodiments so as to for example improve solubility e.g. in water and or methanol e.g. due to increased hydrogen bonding a generation 5 or higher PAMAM dendrimer e.g. amine terminated or alkyne terminated is used.

The dendrimers used in the embodiments of the present invention are not limited by their method of synthesis. The dendrimer may be synthesized by divergent synthesis methods or convergent synthesis methods. In certain embodiments of the present invention dendrimer molecules may be modified. Modifications may include but are not limited to the addition of amine blocking groups e.g. acetyl groups ligands functional groups conjugates and or linkers not originally present on the dendrimer. Modification may be partial or complete. In some embodiments all of the termini of the dendrimer molecules are modified. In some embodiments not all of the dendrimer molecules are modified. In preferred embodiments methods and systems of the present invention permit identification and isolation of subpopulations of dendrimers with known numbers of ligand attachments e.g. conjugations per dendrimer molecule thereby yielding samples or subpopulations of dendrimer compositions with high structural uniformity.

The present invention is not limited to particular ligand types e.g. functional groups e.g. for conjugation with dendrimers via copper free click chemistry . Examples of ligand types e.g. functional groups include but are not limited to therapeutic agents targeting agents trigger agents and imaging agents. In some embodiments the ligand is an alkyne ligand that includes an alkyne group. In some embodiments the ligand is an azide ligand that includes an azido group. In some embodiments the ligand includes an aromatic group. Methods systems and compositions of the present invention are not limited by the number of different ligand types used. There may be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more different types of ligands attached to a dendrimer molecule.

Functionalized dendrimers such as PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with functional ligands e.g. therapeutic agents triggering agents imaging agents targeting agents have many therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However multi step conjugation strategies used to attach different functional ligands to the surfaces of nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers PAMAM dendrimer branches introduce higher polydispersity and require multiple processing steps thereby complicating synthesis and negatively affecting properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting.

For example multifunctional cancer therapeutics have been developed based on Generation 5 PAMAM dendrimers G5 see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 Zhang Y. H. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 2010 21 489 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The targeting molecule folic acid FA and the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate MTX were conjugated sequentially through amide and ester linkages respectively see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 5892 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Although this device was shown to bind and selectively kill KB tumor cells that over express folate receptor FR in vitro and in vivo see e.g. Thomas T. P. et al. J Med Chem 2005 48 3729 Kukowska Latallo J. F. et al. Cancer Res 2005 65 5317 each herein incorporated by reference in its entireties the multi step conjugation strategy that was employed resulted in a mixture of dendrimer populations having varying distributions of the targeting ligands FA and MTX . The resulting polydispersity was more severe and problematic during large scale synthesis of the conjugate which hindered attempts to move into clinical trials. This was because for example the polydisperisty of the functionalized dendrimer based therapeutics likely negatively affected properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics and effectiveness for multivalent targeting see e.g. Gillies E. R. et al. Drug Discov Today 2005 10 35 herein incorporated by reference its entirety . Moreover multi step conjugations make batch to batch reproducibility extremely challenging as the characterization required after each step becomes progressively more difficult see e.g. Mullen D. G. et al. Bioconjugate Chem 2008 19 1748 Mullen D. G. Acs Nano 2010 4 657 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Triazine scaffolds e.g. trivalent reagent 2 4 6 trichloro 1 3 5 triazines as a core scaffold have been used to give access to multifunctional architectures thereby enabling replacing several chemical entities with a single molecule via Cu I catalyzed alkyne azide 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition CuAAC see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010 0158850 Kolb et al. 2001 Angewandte Chemie Intl. Ed. 40 2004 2011 Evans 2007 Australian J. Chem. 60 384 395 Carlmark et al. 2009 Chem. Soc. Rev. 38 352 362 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The cytotoxicity of copper however is a drawback to such techniques as for example the copper is difficult to remove from the dendrimer following conjugation see e.g. van Dijk M. Bioconjug. Chem. 2009 20 2001 2016 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The present invention overcomes such issues and provides improved methods for the synthesis of well defined multifunctional dendrimers. In particular the present invention overcomes this problem through use of copper free click conjugation.

 Copper free click chemistry involves for example the coupling of two different moieties e.g. a therapeutic agent and a functional group e.g. a first functional group and a second functional group via a copper free Huisgen 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction between a cyclooctyne moeity or equivalent thereof on the surface of the first moeity and an azide moiety or equivalent thereof or any active end group such as for example a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. on the second moiety see e.g. Agard ACS Chemical Biology 1 2006 644 648 Baskin PNAS 104 2007 16793 16797 Ornelas JACS 132 2010 3923 3931 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Copper free click chemistry is an attractive coupling method because for example it can be performed with a wide variety of solvent conditions including aqueous environments. Moreover copper free click chemistry avoids copper related cytotoxicity issues found in Cu I catalyzed alkyne azide 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition.

Experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention demonstrated the synthesis of dendrimer compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of copper free click conjugation for use in the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of use of the same.

For example generation 5 G5 poly amidoamine PAMAM dendrimer platforms having cyclooctyne ligands subsequently used for a copper free Huisgen 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition click reaction with azido modified functional groups e.g. methotrexate was demonstrated. In such experiments the G5 PAMAM dendrimer was first partially 70 acetylated and then coupled with 20 cyclooctyne ligands through amide bonds. The remaining primary amine groups on the dendrimer surface were neutralized by acetylation. The platform was then clicked with different numbers 5 10 and 17 of azido functionalized methotrexate. As described in Example 2 Scheme 3 displays a copper free click reaction of the dendrimer platform with azido MTX. The copper free click reactions were stoichiometric with excellent yields. Moreover G5 MTX synthesized via copper free click chemistry was demonstrated as a folate receptor targeted drug conjugate.

Accordingly the present invention provides dendrimer structures wherein conjugation between a ligand and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of copper free click chemistry .

In certain embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with a cyclooctyne ligand and the functional group e.g. methotrexate linked with an azide moiety. Indeed solubility for functional groups within copper free click conjugation is hindered through use of a function group cyclooctyne construct see e.g. Ornelas JACS 132 2010 3923 3931 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In addition in certain preferred embodiments so as to for example improve solubility e.g. in water and or methanol e.g. due to increased hydrogen bonding a generation 5 or higher PAMAM dendrimer e.g. amine terminated or alkyne terminated is used.

The present invention is not limited to particular cyclooctyne moieties or equivalents thereof . In some embodiments the cyclooctyne moiety comprises the following formula 

The present invention is not limited to a particular manner of conjugating the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moieties or equivalents thereof wither either a dendrimer structure and or a functional group. In some embodiments the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moieties or equivalents thereof are conjugated with either a dendrimer and or a functional group via a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. . However as noted in preferred embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with a cyclooctyne ligand and the functional group e.g. methotrexate linked with an azide moiety e.g. as opposed to the dendrimer platform linked with the azide moiety and the functional group linked with the cyclooctyne ligand e.g. so as to increase solvent flexibility e.g. so as to reduce purification difficulty . As such in preferred embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with the cyclooctyne ligand and the azide moiety linked with the functional group.

In experiments conducted during the development of embodiments for the present invention cyclooctyne groups were conjugated with dendrimer structures via amide bonds. For example as described in Example 2 the synthesis of the G5 PAMAM dendrimer with 20 cyclooctyne molecules via amide bonds on the surface is shown in Scheme 1

Anticancer Drugs 2010 21 186 192 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety it was determined that it was difficult to consistently replicate the number of small molecules conjugated to the surface of the dendrimer both within and between batches.

Experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention developed a novel G5 PAMAM platform surface modified with cyclooctyne groups and then further functionalized with small molecules through copper free click chemistry. Cu I catalyzed alkyne azide 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition CuAAC has been widely used for bioconjugation due to several criteria including high yields tolerance toward functional groups and virtually no side reactions see e.g. Meldal M. Chem. Rev. 2008 108 2952 3015 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The cytotoxicity of copper however is a potential drawback of the CuAAC reaction for the synthesis and or functionalization of nanomaterials such as dendrimers for biomedical applications and the copper is difficult to remove from the dendrimer after conjugation see e.g. van Dijk M. Bioconjug. Chem. 2009 20 2001 2016 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The present invention overcomes such issues and provides improved methods for the synthesis of well defined multifunctional dendrimers. In particular the present invention overcomes this problem through use of copper free click conjugation see e.g. Sletten E. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010 132 11799 11805 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Indeed the unusually high ring strain associated with cyclooctyne allows it to react selectively and rapidly with azide groups without byproducts and without the addition of a copper catalyst see e.g. Ornelas C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010 132 3923 3931 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention demonstrated the synthesis of dendrimer compositions e.g. scaffolds capable of copper free click conjugation for use in the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers and methods of use of the same. In certain embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with a cyclooctyne ligand and the functional group e.g. methotrexate linked with an azide moiety e.g. as opposed to the dendrimer platform linked with the azide moiety and the functional group linked with the cyclooctyne ligand e.g. so as to increase solvent flexibility e.g. so as to reduce purification difficulty . In certain preferred embodiments so as to for example improve solubility e.g. in water and or methanol e.g. due to increased hydrogen bonding a generation 5 or higher PAMAM dendrimer e.g. amine terminated or alkyne terminated is used. For example generation 5 G5 poly amidoamine PAMAM dendrimer platforms having cyclooctyne ligands subsequently used for a copper free Huisgen 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition click reaction with azido modified functional groups e.g. methotrexate was demonstrated. In such experiments the G5 PAMAM dendrimer was first partially 70 acetylated and then coupled with 20 cyclooctyne ligands through amide bonds. The remaining primary amine groups on the dendrimer surface were neutralized by acetylation. The platform was then clicked with different numbers 5 10 and 17 of azido functionalized methotrexate. The copper free click reactions were stoichiometric with excellent yields. Moreover G5 MTX synthesized via copper free click chemistry was demonstrated as a folate receptor targeted drug conjugate. Indeed as described in Example 2 Scheme 3 displays a copper free click reaction of the dendrimer platform with azido MTX.

In some embodiments the present invention provides compositions facilitating one step conjugation of functional groups to dendrimers e.g. terminal arms of dendrimers via copper free click chemistry. In some embodiments such compositions comprise multifunctional small molecule architectures e.g. scaffolds which permit conjugation to functional groups e.g. therapeutic groups imaging groups targeting groups pro drugs complexes trigger groups . In some embodiments such functional group conjugated compositions are used for one step conjugation to dendrimers e.g. to terminal branches of dendrimers or modified dendrimers . In some embodiments compositions of the present invention comprise dendrimers conjugated with cyclooctyne moieties via amide bonds.

Accordingly the present invention provides dendrimer structures wherein conjugation between a ligand and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of copper free click chemistry . Copper free click chemistry involves for example the coupling of two different moieties e.g. a therapeutic agent and a functional group e.g. a first functional group and a second functional group via a copper free Huisgen 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction between a cyclooctyne moeity or equivalent thereof on the surface of the first moeity and an azide moiety or equivalent thereof or any active end group such as for example a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. on the second moiety see e.g. Agard ACS Chemical Biology 1 2006 644 648 Baskin PNAS 104 2007 16793 16797 Ornelas JACS 132 2010 3923 3931 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Copper free click chemistry is an attractive coupling method because for example it can be performed with a wide variety of solvent conditions including aqueous environments. Moreover copper free click chemistry avoids copper related cytotoxicity issues found in Cu I catalyzed alkyne azide 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition.

The present invention is not limited to particular azide moieties or equivalent thereof . In some embodiments the azide moiety comprises the formula N. For example Example 2 and Scheme 2 describes the synthesis of an azide moiety N conjugated with a methotrexate compound.

The present invention is not limited to particular cyclooctyne moieties or equivalents thereof . In some embodiments the cyclooctyne moiety comprises the following formula 

The present invention is not limited to a particular manner of conjugating the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moeities or equivalents thereof wither either a dendrimer structure and or a functional group. In some embodiments the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moeities or equivalents thereof are conjugated with either a dendrimer and or a functional group via a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. . However as noted in certain embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with a cyclooctyne ligand and the functional group e.g. methotrexate linked with an azide moiety e.g. as opposed to the dendrimer platform linked with the azide moiety and the functional group linked with the cyclooctyne ligand e.g. so as to increase solvent flexibility e.g. so as to reduce purification difficulty . As such in preferred embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with the cyclooctyne ligand and the azide moiety linked with the functional group.

In experiments conducted during the development of embodiments for the present invention cyclooctyne groups were conjugated with dendrimer structures via amide bonds. For example as described in Example 2 the synthesis of the G5 PAMAM dendrimer with 20 cyclooctyne molecules via amide bonds on the surface is shown in Scheme 1 

The present invention is not limited to the use of particular types and or kinds of dendrimers e.g. a dendrimer conjugated with at least one functional group . Indeed dendrimeric polymers have been described extensively See e.g. Tomalia Advanced Materials 6 529 1994 Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 138 1990 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Dendrimer polymers are synthesized as defined spherical structures typically ranging from 1 to 20 nanometers in diameter. Methods for manufacturing a G5 PAMAM dendrimer with a protected core are known U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 403 179 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In preferred embodiments the protected core diamine is NH CH CH NHPG. Molecular weight and the number of terminal groups increase exponentially as a function of generation the number of layers of the polymer. In some embodiments of the present invention half generation PAMAM dendrimers are used. For example when an ethylenediamine EDA core is used for dendrimer synthesis alkylation of this core through Michael addition results in a half generation molecule with ester terminal groups amidation of such ester groups with excess EDA results in creation of a full generation amine terminated dendrimer Majoros et al. Eds. 2008 Dendrimer based Nanomedicine Pan Stanford Publishing Pte. Ltd. Singapore p. 42 . Different types of dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates the polymerization process. In some embodiments the PAMAM dendrimers are Baker Huang dendrimers or Baker Huang PAMAM dendrimers see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 251 244 and International Patent Application No. PCT US2010 051835 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The dendrimer core structures dictate several characteristics of the molecule such as the overall shape density and surface functionality See e.g. Tomalia et al. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 5305 1990 . Spherical dendrimers can have ammonia as a trivalent initiator core or ethylenediamine EDA as a tetravalent initiator core. Recently described rod shaped dendrimers See e.g. Yin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120 2678 1998 use polyethyleneimine linear cores of varying lengths the longer the core the longer the rod. Dendritic macromolecules are available commercially in kilogram quantities and are produced under current good manufacturing processes GMP for biotechnology applications.

Dendrimers may be characterized by a number of techniques including but not limited to electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light scattering ultraviolet spectrophotometry capillary electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis. These tests assure the uniformity of the polymer population and are important for monitoring quality control of dendrimer manufacture for GMP applications and in vivo usage.

This patent provides methods of introducing a polynucleotide into a eukaryotic cell in vitro comprising contacting the cell with a composition comprising a polynucleotide and a dendrimer polycation non covalently coupled to the polynucleotide.

Dendrimer antibody conjugates for use in in vitro diagnostic applications have previously been demonstrated See e.g. Singh et al. Clin. Chem. 40 1845 1994 for the production of dendrimer chelant antibody constructs and for the development of boronated dendrimer antibody conjugates for neutron capture therapy each of these latter compounds may be used as a cancer therapeutic See e.g. Wu et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Left. 4 449 1994 Wiener et al. Magn. Reson. Med. 31 1 1994 Barth et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 5 58 1994 and Barth et al. .

Some of these conjugates have also been employed in the magnetic resonance imaging of tumors See e.g. Wu et al. 1994 and Wiener et al. 1994 supra . Results from this work have documented that when administered in vivo antibodies can direct dendrimer associated therapeutic agents to antigen bearing tumors. Dendrimers also have been shown to specifically enter cells and carry either chemotherapeutic agents or genetic therapeutics. In particular studies show that cisplatin encapsulated in dendrimer polymers has increased efficacy and is less toxic than cisplatin delivered by other means See e.g. Duncan and Malik Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 23 105 1996 .

Dendrimers have also been conjugated to fluorochromes or molecular beacons and shown to enter cells. They can then be detected within the cell in a manner compatible with sensing apparatus for evaluation of physiologic changes within cells See e.g. Baker et al. Anal. Chem. 69 990 1997 . Finally dendrimers have been constructed as differentiated block copolymers where the outer portions of the molecule may be digested with either enzyme or light induced catalysis See e.g. Urdea and Hom Science 261 534 1993 . This allows the controlled degradation of the polymer to release therapeutics at the disease site and provides a mechanism for an external trigger to release the therapeutic agents.

In certain preferred embodiments so as to for example improve solubility e.g. in water and or methanol e.g. due to increased hydrogen bonding a generation 5 or higher PAMAM dendrimer e.g. amine terminated or alkyne terminated is used.

Accordingly in some embodiments the present invention provides synthesis methods compositions and applications for efficient site specific delivery using functionalized dendrimers with one or more functional groups e.g. therapeutic agents imaging agents targeting agents and trigger agents . In particular in some embodiments the present invention relates to dendrimers conjugated with a therapeutic agent e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent e.g. via copper free click chemistry methods of synthesizing the same as well as systems and methods utilizing the therapeutic and diagnostic compositions e.g. in diagnostic and or therapeutic settings e.g. for the delivery of therapeutics imaging and or targeting agents e.g. in disease e.g. cancer diagnosis and or therapy etc. . For example in some embodiments the novel therapeutic and diagnostic compositions comprise PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with a therapeutic agent e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent e.g. MTX an imaging agent and a targeting agent e.g. FA . As described in more detail below examples of functional groups include but are not limited to targeting groups trigger groups and imaging groups.

The present invention is not limited to the use of particular therapeutic agents. In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are effective in treating autoimmune disorders and or inflammatory disorders e.g. arthritis . Examples of such therapeutic agents include but are not limited to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs e.g. leflunomide methotrexate sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine biologic agents e.g. rituximab infliximab etanercept adalimumab golimumab nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. ibuprofen celecoxib ketoprofen naproxen piroxicam diclofenac analgesics e.g. acetaminophen tramadol immunomodulators e.g. anakinra abatacept and glucocorticoids e.g. prednisone methylprednisone TNF inhibitors e.g. adalimumab certolizumab pegol etanercept golimumab infliximab IL 1 inhibitors and metalloprotease inhibitors. In some embodiments the therapeutic agents include but are not limited to infliximab adalimumab etanercept parenteral gold or oral gold.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are effective in treating cancer see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 471 968 7 078 461 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09 940 243 10 431 682 11 503 742 11 661 465 11 523 509 12 403 179 12 106 876 and 11 827 637 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61 256 759 61 140 840 61 091 608 61 097 780 61 101 461 61 237 172 61 229 168 61 221 596 and 61 251 244 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In some embodiments the ligand e.g. therapeutic agent is conjugated with the dendrimer via a trigger agent. The present invention is not limited to particular types or kinds of trigger agents.

In some embodiments sustained release e.g. slow release over a period of 24 48 hours of the ligand e.g. therapeutic agent is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent e.g. directly e.g. indirectly through one or more additional functional groups to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ester linkage ether linkage . In some embodiments constitutively active release of a therapeutic agent is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent to a trigger agent that renders the therapeutic agent constitutively active in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ether linkage .

In some embodiments release of a therapeutic agent under specific conditions is accomplished through conjugating the therapeutic agent e.g. directly e.g. indirectly through one or more additional functional groups to a trigger agent that degrades under such specific conditions e.g. through activation of a trigger molecule under specific conditions that leads to release of the therapeutic agent . For example once a conjugate e.g. a therapeutic agent conjugated with a trigger agent and a targeting agent arrives at a target site in a subject e.g. a tumor or a site of inflammation components in the target site e.g. a tumor associated factor or an inflammatory or pain associated factor interact with the trigger agent thereby initiating cleavage of the therapeutic agent from the trigger agent. In some embodiments the trigger agent is configured to degrade e.g. release the therapeutic agent upon exposure to a tumor associated factor e.g. hypoxia and pH an enzyme e.g. glucuronidase and or plasmin a cathepsin a matrix metalloproteinase a hormone receptor e.g. integrin receptor hyaluronic acid receptor luteinizing hormone releasing hormone receptor etc. cancer and or tumor specific DNA sequence an inflammatory associated factor e.g. chemokine cytokine etc. or other moiety.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a therapeutic agent conjugated with a trigger agent that is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by hypoxia e.g. indolequinone . Hypoxia is a feature of several disease states including cancer inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis as well as an indicator of respiratory depression e.g. resulting from analgesic drugs .

Advances in the chemistry of bioreductive drug activation have led to the design of various hypoxia selective drug delivery systems in which the pharmacophores of drugs are masked by reductively cleaved groups. In some embodiments the trigger agent is utilizes a quinone N oxide and or hetero aromatic nitro groups. For example a quinone present in a conjugate is reduced to phenol under hypoxia conditions with spontaneous formation of lactone that serves as a driving force for drug release. In some embodiments a heteroaromatic nitro compound present in a conjugate e.g. a therapeutic agent conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly with a trigger agent is reduced to either an amine or a hydroxylamine thereby triggering the spontaneous release of a therapeutic agent. In some embodiments the trigger agent degrades upon detection of reduced pO2 concentrations e.g. through use of a redox linker .

The concept of pro drug systems in which the pharmacophores of drugs are masked by reductively cleavable groups has been widely explored by many research groups and pharmaceutical companies see e.g. Beall H. D. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1998. 41 24 p. 4755 4766 Ferrer S. D. P. Naughton and M. D. Threadgill Tetrahedron 2003. 59 19 p. 3445 3454 Naylor M. A. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1997. 40 15 p. 2335 2346 Phillips R. M. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1999. 42 20 p. 4071 4080 Zhang Z. et al. Organic Biomolecular Chemistry 2005. 3 10 p. 1905 1910 each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Several such hypoxia activated pro drugs have been advanced to clinical investigations and work in relevant oxygen concentrations to prevent cerebral damage. The present invention is not limited to particular hypoxia activated trigger agents. In some embodiments the hypoxia activated trigger agents include but are not limited to indolequinones nitroimidazoles and nitroheterocycles see e.g. Damen E. W. P. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 2002. 10 1 p. 71 77 Hay M. P. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2003. 46 25 p. 5533 5545 Hay M. P. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society Perkin Transactions 1 1999 19 p. 2759 2770 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a tumor associated enzyme. For example in some embodiments the trigger agent that is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a glucuronidase. Glucuronic acid can be attached to several anticancer drugs via various linkers. These anticancer drugs include but are not limited to doxorubicin paclitaxel docetaxel 5 fluorouracil 9 aminocamtothecin as well as other drugs under development. These pro drugs are generally stable at physiological pH and are significantly less toxic than the parent drugs.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with brain enzymes. For example trigger agents such as indolequinone are reduced by brain enzymes such as for example diaphorase DT diaphorase see e.g. Damen E. W. P. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 2002. 10 1 p. 71 77 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . For example in such embodiments the antagonist is only active when released during hypoxia to prevent respiratory failure.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a protease. The present invention is not limited to any particular protease. In some embodiments the protease is a cathepsin. In some embodiments a trigger comprises a Lys Phe PABC moiety e.g. that acts as a trigger . In some embodiments a Lys Phe PABC moiety linked to doxorubicin mitomycin C and paclitaxel are utilized as a trigger therapeutic conjugate in a dendrimer conjugate provided herein e.g. that serve as substrates for lysosomal cathepsin B or other proteases expressed e.g. overexpressed in tumor cells. In some embodiments utilization of a 1 6 elimination spacer linker is utilized e.g. to permit release of therapeutic drug post activation of trigger .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with plasmin. The serine protease plasmin is over expressed in many human tumor tissues. Tripeptide specifiers e.g. including but not limited to Val Leu Lys have been identified and linked to anticancer drugs through elimination or cyclization linkers.

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or associates with a matrix metalloprotease MMP . In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or that associates with 13 Lactamase e.g. a 13 Lactamase activated cephalosporin based pro drug .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or activated by a receptor e.g. expressed on a target cell e.g. a tumor cell .

In some embodiments the trigger agent is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or activated by a nucleic acid. Nucleic acid triggered catalytic drug release can be utilized in the design of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus in some embodiments disease specific nucleic acid sequence is utilized as a drug releasing enzyme like catalyst e.g. via complex formation with a complimentary catalyst bearing nucleic acid and or analog . In some embodiments the release of a therapeutic agent is facilitated by the therapeutic component being attached to a labile protecting group such as for example cisplatin or methotrexate being attached to a photolabile protecting group that becomes released by laser light directed at cells emitting a color of fluorescence e.g. in addition to and or in place of target activated activation of a trigger component of a dendrimer conjugate . In some embodiments the therapeutic device also may have a component to monitor the response of the tumor to therapy. For example where a therapeutic agent of the dendrimer induces apoptosis of a target cell e.g. a cancer cell e.g. a prostate cancer cell the caspase activity of the cells may be used to activate a green fluorescence. This allows apoptotic cells to turn orange combination of red and green while residual cells remain red. Any normal cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis in collateral damage fluoresce green.

In some embodiments a dendrimer is conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly e.g. via copper free click chemistry with a targeting agent. The present invention is not limited to any particular targeting agent. In some embodiments targeting agents are conjugated to a dendrimer e.g. directly or indirectly for delivery to desired body regions e.g. to the central nervous system CNS to a tumor . The targeting agents are not limited to targeting specific body regions.

In some embodiments the targeting agent is a moiety that has affinity for a tumor associated factor. For example a number of targeting agents are contemplated to be useful in the present invention including but not limited to RGD sequences low density lipoprotein sequences a NAALADase inhibitor epidermal growth factor and other agents that bind with specificity to a target cell e.g. a cancer cell .

The present invention is not limited to cancer and or tumor targeting agents. Indeed multifunctional dendrimers can be targeted e.g. via a linker conjugated to the dendrimer wherein the linker comprises a targeting agent to a variety of target cells or tissues e.g. to a biologically relevant environment via conjugation to an appropriate targeting agent. For example in some embodiments the targeting agent is a moiety that has affinity for an inflammatory factor e.g. a cytokine or a cytokine receptor moiety e.g. TNF receptor . In some embodiments the targeting agent is a sugar peptide antibody or antibody fragment hormone hormone receptor or the like.

In some embodiments of the present invention the targeting agent includes but is not limited to an antibody receptor ligand hormone vitamin and antigen however the present invention is not limited by the nature of the targeting agent. In some embodiments the antibody is specific for a disease specific antigen. In some embodiments the disease specific antigen comprises a tumor specific antigen. In some embodiments the receptor ligand includes but is not limited to a ligand for CFTR EGFR estrogen receptor FGR2 folate receptor IL 2 receptor glycoprotein and VEGFR. In some embodiments the receptor ligand is folic acid.

Antibodies can be generated to allow for the targeting of antigens or immunogens e.g. tumor tissue or pathogen specific antigens on various biological targets e.g. pathogens tumor cells normal tissue . Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain Fab fragments and an Fab expression library.

In some embodiments the targeting agent is an antibody. In some embodiments the antibodies recognize for example tumor specific epitopes e.g. TAG 72 See e.g. Kjeldsen et al.

In some embodiments the targeting agents target the central nervous system CNS . In some embodiments where the targeting agent is specific for the CNS the targeting agent is transferrin see e.g. Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 159 176 Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 144 158 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Transferrin has been utilized as a targeting vector to transport for example drugs liposomes and proteins across the blood brain barrier BBB by receptor mediated transcytosis see e.g. Smith M.

In some embodiments a dendrimer is conjugated e.g. directly or indirectly e.g. via copper free click chemistry to an imaging agent. A multiplicity of imaging agents find use in the present invention. In some embodiments a multifunctional dendrimer comprises at least one imaging agent that can be readily imaged. The present invention is not limited by the nature of the imaging component used. In some embodiments of the present invention imaging modules comprise surface modifications of quantum dots See e.g. Chan and Nie Science 281 2016 1998 such as zinc sulfide capped cadmium selenide coupled to biomolecules Sooklal Adv. Mater. 10 1083 1998 .

In some embodiments once a component s of a targeted multifunctional dendrimer has attached to or been internalized into a target cell e.g. tumor cell and or inflammatory cell one or more modules on serves to image its location. In some embodiments chelated paramagnetic ions such as Gd III diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid Gd III DTPA are conjugated to the multifunctional dendrimer. Other paramagnetic ions that may be useful in this context include but are not limited to gadolinium manganese copper chromium iron cobalt erbium nickel europium technetium indium samarium dysprosium ruthenium ytterbium yttrium and holmium ions and combinations thereof.

Dendrimeric gadolinium contrast agents have even been used to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors using dynamic MRI based on how the vasculature for the latter type of tumor images more densely Adam et al. Ivest. Rad. 31 26 1996 . Thus MRI provides a particularly useful imaging system of the present invention.

Multifunctional dendrimers allow functional microscopic imaging of tumors and provide improved methods for imaging. The methods find use in vivo in vitro and ex vivo. For example in one embodiment dendrimer functional groups are designed to emit light or other detectable signals upon exposure to light. Although the labeled functional groups may be physically smaller than the optical resolution limit of the microscopy technique they become self luminous objects when excited and are readily observable and measurable using optical techniques. In some embodiments of the present invention sensing fluorescent biosensors in a microscope involves the use of tunable excitation and emission filters and multiwavelength sources See e.g. Farkas et al. SPEI 2678 200 1997 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In embodiments where the imaging agents are present in deeper tissue longer wavelengths in the Near infrared NMR are used See e.g. Lester et al. Cell Mol. Biol. 44 29 1998 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Biosensors that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to fluorescent dyes and molecular beacons.

In some embodiments of the present invention in vivo imaging is accomplished using functional imaging techniques. Functional imaging is a complementary and potentially more powerful techniques as compared to static structural imaging. Functional imaging is best known for its application at the macroscopic scale with examples including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and Positron Emission Tomography PET . However functional microscopic imaging may also be conducted and find use in in vivo and ex vivo analysis of living tissue. Functional microscopic imaging is an efficient combination of 3 D imaging 3 D spatial multispectral volumetric assignment and temporal sampling in short a type of 3 D spectral microscopic movie loop. Interestingly cells and tissues autofluoresce when excited by several wavelengths providing much of the basic 3 D structure needed to characterize several cellular components e.g. the nucleus without specific labeling. Oblique light illumination is also useful to collect structural information and is used routinely. As opposed to structural spectral microimaging functional spectral microimaging may be used with biosensors which act to localize physiologic signals within the cell or tissue. For example in some embodiments biosensor comprising pro drug complexes are used to image upregulated receptor families such as the folate or EGF classes. In such embodiments functional biosensing therefore involves the detection of physiological abnormalities relevant to carcinogenesis or malignancy even at early stages. A number of physiological conditions may be imaged using the compositions and methods of the present invention including but not limited to detection of nanoscopic biosensors for pH oxygen concentration Ca concentration and other physiologically relevant analytes.

In some embodiments the present invention provides multifunctional dendrimers having a biological monitoring component. The biological monitoring or sensing component of a multifunctional dendrimer is one that can monitor the particular response in a target cell e.g. tumor cell induced by an agent e.g. a therapeutic agent provided by a multifunctional dendrimer .

In some embodiments fluorescent groups such as fluorescein are employed in the imaging agent. Fluorescein is easily attached to the dendrimer surface via the isothiocyanate derivatives available from MOLECULAR PROBES Inc. This allows the multifunctional dendrimer or components thereof to be imaged with the cells via confocal microscopy. Sensing of the effectiveness of the multifunctional dendrimer or components thereof is preferably achieved by using fluorogenic peptide enzyme substrates. For example apoptosis caused by the therapeutic agent results in the production of the peptidase caspase 1 ICE . CALBIOCHEM sells a number of peptide substrates for this enzyme that release a fluorescent moiety. A particularly useful peptide for use in the present invention is MCA Tyr Glu Val Asp Gly Trp Lys DNP NH SEQ ID NO 1 where MCA is the 7 methoxycoumarin 4 yl acetyl and DNP is the 2 4 dinitrophenyl group See e.g. Talanian et al. J. Biol. Chem. 272 9677 1997 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In this peptide the MCA group has greatly attenuated fluorescence due to fluorogenic resonance energy transfer FRET to the DNP group. When the enzyme cleaves the peptide between the aspartic acid and glycine residues the MCA and DNP are separated and the MCA group strongly fluoresces green excitation maximum at 325 nm and emission maximum at 392 nm . In some embodiments the lysine end of the peptide is linked to pro drug complex so that the MCA group is released into the cytosol when it is cleaved. The lysine end of the peptide is a useful synthetic handle for conjugation because for example it can react with the activated ester group of a bifunctional linker such as Mal PEG OSu. Thus the appearance of green fluorescence in the target cells produced using these methods provides a clear indication that apoptosis has begun if the cell already has a red color from the presence of aggregated quantum dots the cell turns orange from the combined colors .

Additional fluorescent dyes that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to acridine orange reported as sensitive to DNA changes in apoptotic cells see e.g. Abrams et al. Development 117 29 1993 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and cis parinaric acid sensitive to the lipid peroxidation that accompanies apoptosis see e.g. Hockenbery et al. Cell 75 241 1993 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . It should be noted that the peptide and the fluorescent dyes are merely exemplary. It is contemplated that any peptide that effectively acts as a substrate for a caspase produced as a result of apoptosis finds use with the present invention.

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of copper free click chemistry. Copper free click chemistry involves for example the coupling of two different moieties e.g. a therapeutic agent and a functional group e.g. a first functional group and a second functional group via a copper free Huisgen 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction between a cyclooctyne moeity or equivalent thereof on the surface of the first moeity and an azide moiety or equivalent thereof or any active end group such as for example a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. on the second moiety. Copper free click chemistry is an attractive coupling method because for example it can be performed with a wide variety of solvent conditions including aqueous environments. Moreover copper free click chemistry avoids copper related cytotoxicity issues found in Cu I catalyzed alkyne azide 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition.

The present invention is not limited to particular azide moieties or equivalent thereof . In some embodiments the azide moiety comprises the formula N. For example Example 2 and Scheme 2 describes the synthesis of an azide moiety N conjugated with a methotrexate compound.

The present invention is not limited to particular cyclooctyne moieties or equivalents thereof . In some embodiments the cyclooctyne moiety comprises the following formula 

The present invention is not limited to a particular manner of conjugating the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moeities or equivalents thereof wither either a dendrimer structure and or a functional group. In some embodiments the azide moieties or equivalents thereof and or the cyclooctyne moeities or equivalents thereof are conjugated with either a dendrimer and or a functional group via a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. . In certain embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with a cyclooctyne ligand and the functional group e.g. methotrexate linked with an azide moiety e.g. as opposed to the dendrimer platform linked with the azide moiety and the functional group linked with the cyclooctyne ligand e.g. so as to increase solvent flexibility e.g. so as to reduce purification difficulty . As such in preferred embodiments the dendrimer platform is linked with the cyclooctyne ligand and the azide moiety linked with the functional group.

In experiments conducted during the development of embodiments for the present invention cyclooctyne groups were conjugated with dendrimer structures via amide bonds. For example as described in Example 2 the synthesis of the G5 PAMAM dendrimer with 20 cyclooctyne molecules via amide bonds on the surface is shown in Scheme 1 

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. a terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional ligand is accomplished during a one pot reaction. The term one pot synthesis reaction or equivalents thereof e.g. 1 pot one pot etc. refers to a chemical synthesis method in which all reactants are present in a single vessel. Reactants may be added simultaneously or sequentially with no limitation as to the duration of time elapsing between introduction of sequentially added reactants. In some embodiments a one pot reaction occurs wherein a hydroxyl terminated dendrimer e.g. HO PAMAM dendrimer is reacted with one or more functional ligands e.g. a therapeutic agent a pro drug a trigger agent a targeting agent an imaging agent in one vessel such conjugation being facilitated by ester coupling agents e.g. 2 chloro 1 methylpyridinium iodide and 4 dimethylamino pyridine see e.g. International Patent Application No. PCT US2010 042556 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Functionalized nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers often contain moieties including but not limited to ligands functional ligands conjugates therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents fluorophores that are conjugated to the periphery. Such moieties may for example be conjugated to one or more dendrimer branch termini. Classical multi step conjugation strategies used during the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers generate a stochastic distribution of products with differing numbers of ligands attached per dendrimer molecule thereby creating a population of dendrimers with a wide distribution in the numbers of ligands attached. The low structural uniformity of such dendrimer populations negatively affects properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting. Difficulties in quantifying and resolving such populations to yield samples with sufficient structural uniformity can pose challenges. However in some embodiments use of separation methods e.g. reverse phase chromatography customized for optimal separation of dendrimer populations in conjunction with peak fitting analysis methods allows isolation and identification of subpopulations of functionalized dendrimers with high structural uniformity see e.g. U.S. Provisional Pat. App. No. 61 237 172 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In certain embodiments such methods and systems provide a dendrimer product made by the process comprising a conjugation of at least one ligand type to a dendrimer to yield a population of ligand conjugated dendrimers b separation of the population of ligand conjugated dendrimers with reverse phase HPLC to result in subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers indicated by a chromatographic trace and c application of peak fitting analysis to the chromatographic trace to identify subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers wherein the structural uniformity of ligand conjugates per molecule of dendrimer within said subpopulation is e.g. approximately 80 or more.

The present invention is not limited by the type of therapeutic agent delivered via multifunctional dendrimers of the present invention. For example a therapeutic agent may be any agent selected from the group comprising but not limited to a pain relief agent a pain relief agent antagonist a chemotherapeutic agent an anti oncogenic agent an anti angiogenic agent a tumor suppressor agent an anti microbial agent or an expression construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a therapeutic protein.

Where clinical applications are contemplated in some embodiments of the present invention the dendrimer conjugates are prepared as part of a pharmaceutical composition in a form appropriate for the intended application. Generally this entails preparing compositions that are essentially free of pyrogens as well as other impurities that could be harmful to humans or animals. However in some embodiments of the present invention a straight dendrimer formulation may be administered using one or more of the routes described herein.

In preferred embodiments the dendrimer conjugates are used in conjunction with appropriate salts and buffers to render delivery of the compositions in a stable manner to allow for uptake by target cells. Buffers also are employed when the dendrimer conjugates are introduced into a patient. Aqueous compositions comprise an effective amount of the dendrimer conjugates to cells dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or aqueous medium. Such compositions also are referred to as inocula. The phrase pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce adverse allergic or other untoward reactions when administered to an animal or a human. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with vectors cells or tissues its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients may also be incorporated into the compositions.

In some embodiments of the present invention the active compositions include classic pharmaceutical preparations. Administration of these compositions according to the present invention is via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. This includes oral nasal buccal rectal vaginal or topical. Alternatively administration may be by orthotopic intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.

The active dendrimer conjugates may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally or intratumorally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts are prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

In some embodiments a therapeutic agent is released from dendrimer conjugates within a target cell e.g. within an endosome . This type of intracellular release e.g. endosomal disruption of a linker therapeutic conjugate is contemplated to provide additional specificity for the compositions and methods of the present invention. The present invention provides dendrimers with multiple e.g. 100 150 reactive sites for the conjugation of linkers and or functional groups comprising but not limited to therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents and biological monitoring agents.

The compositions and methods of the present invention are contemplated to be equally effective whether or not the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention comprise a fluorescein e.g. FITC imaging agent. Thus each functional group present in a dendrimer composition is able to work independently of the other functional groups. Thus the present invention provides dendrimer conjugates that can comprise multiple combinations of targeting therapeutic imaging and biological monitoring functional groups.

The present invention also provides a very effective and specific method of delivering molecules e.g. therapeutic and imaging functional groups to the interior of target cells e.g. cancer cells . Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides methods of therapy that comprise or require delivery of molecules into a cell in order to function e.g. delivery of genetic material such as siRNAs .

The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it may be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

Upon formulation dendrimer conjugates are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as injectable solutions drug release capsules and the like. For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution for example the solution is suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. For example one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion see for example Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition pages 1035 1038 and 1570 1580 . In some embodiments of the present invention the active particles or agents are formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise about 0.0001 to 1.0 milligrams or about 0.001 to 0.1 milligrams or about 0.1 to 1.0 or even about 10 milligrams per dose or so. Multiple doses may be administered.

Additional formulations that are suitable for other modes of administration include vaginal suppositories and pessaries. A rectal pessary or suppository may also be used. Suppositories are solid dosage forms of various weights and shapes usually medicated for insertion into the rectum vagina or the urethra. After insertion suppositories soften melt or dissolve in the cavity fluids. In general for suppositories traditional binders and carriers may include for example polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 10 preferably 1 2 . Vaginal suppositories or pessaries are usually globular or oviform and weighing about 5 g each. Vaginal medications are available in a variety of physical forms e.g. creams gels or liquids which depart from the classical concept of suppositories. In addition suppositories may be used in connection with colon cancer. The dendrimer conjugates also may be formulated as inhalants for the treatment of lung cancer and such like.

In some embodiments the present invention also provides kits comprising one or more of the reagents and tools necessary to generate a dendrimer conjugated with one or more functional groups e.g. via copper free click chemistry and methods of using such dendrimers.

The following examples are provided in order to demonstrate and further illustrate certain preferred embodiments and aspects of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.

The synthesis of the G5 PAMAM dendrimer with 20 cyclooctyne molecules on the surface is shown in Scheme 1.

Briefly G5 PAMAM dendrimer 112 primary amine groups on surface based on potentiometric titration results see e.g. Mullen D. G. ACS Nano 2010 4 657 670 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety was first partially acetylated with acetic anhydride 75 equiv in methanol in the presence of triethyl amine TEA . This step enhances the solubility of dendrimer in organic solvents. After purification using a 10 KMW cut off ultrafiltration membrane compound 2 yielded a white solid after lyophilization. The cyclooctyne ligand 3 was synthesized by a method from recent reports see e.g. Ornelas C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010 132 3923 3931 Bernardin A. Bioconjug. Chem. 2010 21 583 588 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Partially acetylated dendrimer 2 and compound 3 20 equiv were then dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO with diisopropyl ethylamine DIPEA . Py Bop15 reagent in DMSO was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. The remaining primary amine groups were neutralized by acetylation to minimize nonspecific binding. Compound 5 was purified via membrane filtration as described above. The overall recovery yield of 5 is 81 2 5 two steps .

The average number of conjugated molecules per dendrimer was determined by 1H NMR . Based on a literature method the number of acetamide groups for compound 2 was calculated to be 72.13 The integration of methyl groups NHCOCH 1.84 ppm was set to 216 and this peak was used as an internal reference to determine the number of ligands . Based on the NMR integration values 40 primary amine groups remained on the dendrimer surface that could be used to conjugate the cyclooctyne ligand. After the conjugation the methyne proton signal 4.42 ppm in the eight member ring of compound 3 was well separated from the dendrimer proton peaks in NMR spectrum that allowed integration of this peak and determination of the total cyclooctyne numbers . Based on the 1H NMR a total of 20 cyclooctyne molecules were attached per dendrimer molecule. The remaining amino groups were then completely acetylated to give compound 5. In this case if the integration of the methyne proton 4.42 ppm is set to 20 the integration of the acetamide is 270 which is close to the theoretic number 276 92 acetamide groups .

MTX is a well known and extensively characterized antineoplastic agent that is active when conjugated to a dendrimer see e.g. Kamal M. A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996 159 47 53 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Using a modified literature procedure 17 c azido MTX was synthesized Scheme 2 .

Briefly 4 amino 4 deoxy N10 methylpteroic acid APA was first reacted with Glu a OtBu using BOP15 reagent to give a OtBu MTX see e.g. Shukla R. Chem. Commun. 2005 5739 5741 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Then the c carboxylic acid was coupled with 3 azido propyl amine in the presence of HATU PyBop bromotripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate BOP reagent benzotriazol 1 yloxytris dimethylamino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate HATU O 7 azabenzotriazol 1 yl N N N0 N0 tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate . After exposure of a carboxylic acid functional group with trifluoroacetic acid TFA compound 8 was obtained in excellent yield. All compounds were characterized with 1H NMR and electrospray mass spectra. Compound 8 was further analyzed with HPLC.

Using a copper free click conjugations protocol compound 8 was then clicked to the newly synthesized cyclooctyne dendrimer platform. Scheme 3 Because MTX has a much lower affinity toward the alpha folate receptor than folic acid see e.g. Genestier L. Immunopharmacology 2000 47 247 257 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety different stoichiometries of MTX were conjugated to the platform in order to eventually use this material to test therapeutic effects. This was based on the hypothesis that more MTX molecules on dendrimer surface will enhance the internalization of the nanoparticle because of multivalent binding thus increases cytotoxicity. Initially the dendrimer platform 5 was dissolved in methanol 2.0 mM variable equivalents of c azido MTX 8 5 10 and 18 equiv in DMSO 40 mM were added. The reactions were stirred for 24 h at room temperature shielded from light. After the removal of organic solvent the residues were redissolved in phosphate buffer saline 1 PBS buffer pH 7.4 and purified by 10 K centrifugal filters PBS2 DI water 6 and then lyophilized to give compounds 9 10 and 11. The recovery yields of 9 and 10 were excellent 85 . Compound 11 has a relatively poor solubility in water and PBS buffer which resulted in a low recovery yield 30 .

The average numbers of MTX molecules in each conjugates were determined by 1H NMR . The aromatic proton in the pteridine ring has a chemical shift at 8.61 ppm and it is well separated from other proton peaks. Comparison of the integration of this peak to the internal acetamide proton integration will determine the numbers of MTX attached. In this case the integrations of the internal reference peaks were set to 276 which represent 92 acetamide groups. The numbers of MTX are 4.78 9.88 and 16.87 for compounds 9 10 and 11 respectively. These results indicate that the copper free click reactions are highly efficient with 90 of c azido MTX conjugated. HPLC profiles of these three compounds have more than 98 purity.

The results of this study also point to a number of advantages that the approach of having the cylcooctyne ligand attached to the dendrimer and the azide moiety coupled to methotrexate as compared to the opposite approach azide moiety on dendrimer and cyclooctyne coupled to methotrexate . For example some advantages of this approach e.g. having the cylcooctyne ligand attached to the dendrimer and the azide moiety coupled to methotrexate include but are not limited to improved solubility of reactants greater flexibility in solvent systems and reduced material heterogeneity. Poor solubility of the reactants in a dendrimer reaction would also have implications on the quality of mass transport and in a situation where there is an excess of conjugation sites on the dendrimer relative to the amount of functional group being attached have a negative effect on the material uniformity. Sub optimal mass transport has been shown to be dramatically increase material heterogeneity of a dendrimer functional group system for soluble functional groups that reacted under poor mixing conditions see e.g. Mullen D. et al. Macromolecules 2010 43 6577 6587 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Maintaining aqueous solubility of the cyclooctyne on the dendrimer is made possible through the use of a high generation generation 5 in this example dendrimer. This is because for example the dendrimer backbone has sufficient hydrogen bonding sites at generations 5 and higher to solubilize the cyclooctyne ligand in water or methanol.

Biol. 2007 14 107 15 Arranz Plaza E. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002 124 13035 46 Adler P. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1995 270 5164 71 Gestwicki J. E. et al. Anal. Biochem. 2002 305 149 55 Rao J. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999 121 2629 30 Tassa C. et al. Bioconj. Chem. 2010 21 14 19 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Folate binding protein FBP presenting chip was prepared at the surface protein density of 11 ng mm 2 3 FBP per 10 nm following an EDC based amide coupling method as described previously see e.g. Hong S. et al. Chem. Biol. 2007 14 107 15 Plantinga A. et al. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2011 2 363 67 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Binding studies of small molecule ligands FA MTX and dendrimer MTX conjugates G5 MTX n 0 5 10 were performed using the FBP presenting chip.

As shown in the G5 control dendrimer G5 MTX did not show any significant binding to the FBP . In contrast the G5 MTXand G5 MTXbound in a concentration dependent fashion . These results are indicative of specific adsorption to FBP by the MTX ligand attached to the dendrimer. The G5 MTX conjugates showed markedly slow dissociation a hall mark for multivalent tight binding as consistently observed in numerous other multivalent systems see e.g. Hong S. et al. Chem. Biol. 2007 14 107 15 Arranz Plaza E. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002 124 13035 46 Adler P. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1995 270 5164 71 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Such a dissociation feature is also in agreement with G5 FA a multivalent dendrimer comparator presenting the FA ligand see e.g. Hong S. et al. Chem. Biol. 2007 14 107 15 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

In an approach to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants K for G5 MTXon a quantitative basis the SPR data was analyzed by using the non linear regression method as established for SPR analysis see e.g. Ober R. J. et al. Anal. Biochem. 2003 312 57 65 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . This analytical method enabled the SPR data to be fit according to a linear combination of exponential functions and to extract the estimates for their kinetic rate constants k k and K . The binding avidity of G5 MTX K 28 nM and G5 MTX K 5.5 nM is 857 and 4360 times higher than free MTX molecule K 24 M . This observation is fully consistent with the hypothesis that complete dissociation by a multivalent ligand occurs very slowly because all of the ligands tethered to a single multivalent particle have to dissociate simultaneously from multiple receptor sites see e.g. Arranz Plaza E. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002 124 13035 46 Adler P. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1995 270 5164 71 Mammen M. et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998 37 2755 each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . While not limited to a particular mechanism of understanding these results indicate that the G5 MTXconjugates bind much more tightly to the multivalent FR on the surface than a free MTX molecule. It further indicates that it is promising to target FAR overexpressing cells using an MTX based dual acting targeting agent and drug multivalent platform.

In order to test the binding of G5 MTXn on to folate receptor FR expressing cells a fluorescently tagged G5 5T MTX conjugate was synthesized using 5TAMRA 5T as the fluorescent dye. As shown in the G5 5T MTXbound to the FR expressing KB cells in a dose dependent fashion A and the binding was completely blocked in the presence of excess free FA indicating receptor mediated binding B . Flow cytometric analysis also showed that the G5 5T MTXconjugate failed to bind to the FR negative B16 F10 cells up to 300 nM even after a 20 h incubation period.

The internalization of the conjugate was tested by confocal microscopy . The G5 5T MTX internalized into the FR expressing KB cells but not into the FR negative B16 cells. A z series analysis in KB cells confirmed the cytosolic presence of the conjugate in KB cells.

The efficacy of the G5 MTXto inhibit the enzyme DHFR was examined in an in vitro enzymatic assay system. As shown in the G5 MTXsignificantly inhibited the DHFR at 300 and 1000 nM concentrations.

The cytotoxicity of the G5 MTXwas tested in the FR expressing KB and RAW264.7 cell lines and in the FR negative B16 F10 cell line. As given in A and B in the cervical carcinoma KB and the macrophage cell line RAW the conjugate induced a dose dependent cytotoxicity with maximal inhibition between 30 and 100 nM whereas the conjugate was non cytotoxic in the FR negative B16 F10 cell line up to 1000 nM . Another batch of a synthetic conjugate with 6 MTX G5 MTX also showed cytotoxicity in KB cells with about 15 20 lower potential vs. the G5 MTX.

These studies show that multivalent G5 MTXn serves as a simple but potent nanotherapuetic for the treatment of cancer as well as rheumatoid arthritis.
