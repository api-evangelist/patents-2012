This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 120 and is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 570 839 entitled Prescription of Electronic Resources Based on Observational Assessments filed on Aug. 9 2012 which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 523 156 entitled Observation 360 filed on Aug. 12 2011 Provisional Application No. 61 523 187 entitled Student Assessment Data filed on Aug. 12 2011 and Provisional Application No. 61 654 813 entitled Teacher Effectiveness Systems and Methods filed on Jun. 2 2012 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present disclosure relates to computing and more particularly to managing monitoring and promoting user development and effectiveness.

In recent years some educational systems have been implementing increasingly rigorous educational standards defining what students are expected to competently learn in order to be considered acceptably educated. However these educational systems can be limited in reliably determining how their educators are performing relative to these standards or providing the educators that are struggling to meet the standards with the targeted assistance and resources they need to improve. For instance these educational systems may be slow or unable to identify and address the specific needs and deficiencies of their educators and thus fail to maximize their students potential and negatively affect their students achievement such as level of knowledge testing performance and actual student learning. In some cases these educational systems are slow to act due to the use of obsolete legacy systems and resources to manage their educators. For instance these educational systems may use paper based observation and evaluation assessment methods that can be misplaced lost or forgotten about. Additionally even when eventually entered into a central human resource management system the assessment results may require further manual processing and interpretation before any action is taken to address any needs or deficiencies revealed by the results.

Furthermore these educational systems often use various combinations of disparate systems some manual some computerized to manage various aspects of their organizations. In some cases each of these disparate systems may provide a separate tool for evaluating employees formally or informally providing training providing evidence managing human resources managing student achievement etc. However due to the lack of integration between these systems it is often difficult for the administrators to tell how their organizations are performing either as a whole or by grade department or individual which can result in considerable amount of time passing before any action is taken to address the needs of their organizations or employees. Moreover actions taken by these administrators are often ineffective as the administrators lack the information they need to target their actions to the needs of their organizations or members.

According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure a system includes a management module an assessment module a content module and a reporting module. The management module determines a goal for a plurality of users of an organization to meet and a workflow for achieving the goal. The assessment module determines an assessment of a first performance of the first user based on the workflow and personalizes an electronic resource to a need of the first user based on the assessment of the performance. The content module provides the first electronic resource to the first user for interaction and the reporting module generates a report describing the electronic resource and the assessment of the first performance.

In general another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in a method that includes determining a goal for a plurality of users of an organization to meet determining a workflow for achieving the goal determining an assessment of a first performance of the first user based on the workflow personalizing a first electronic resource to a need of the first user based on the assessment of the first performance providing the first electronic resource to the first user for interaction and generating a report describing the first electronic resource and the assessment of the first performance.

Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer programs configured to perform the actions of the methods encoded on computer storage devices.

The technology described herein provides many benefits including but not limited to preparing educators to get their students to be college and career ready by providing all the tools necessary in order to implement track and drive a full educator effectiveness and evaluation system across a school or district. For example the technology integrates all the components necessary in order to give every educator a truly personalized professional learning plan. By using that personalized professional learning plan every educator can help every child in his her class be college and career ready. The technology also gives educators such as administrators the tools necessary to define a process and track every educator in the district or school to ensure that they have the observations necessary receive the personalized professional development based on those observations and then go through the school s or district s evaluation process. Further the technology can provide rich reporting and analytics functionality allowing the district to get the necessary data and generate the necessary reports for full compliancy with a governing body such as a state or federal government and can include a repository providing access to effectiveness evidence for the educators of the district which may include samples of student work teacher and or student assessment results e.g. observation and evaluation results activity logs lesson plans and other information that demonstrates the educators effectiveness. The technology can also provide educators with an easy to use platform that gives them access to numerous professional development videos and other electronic resources designed to help them implement best practices in the classroom.

The controller may in various instances signal the foregoing components to perform their respective operations and provide information to the entity requesting it.

The management module is software code logic or routines for setting and managing goals for the users of an organization to meet and defining and managing workflows for achieving the goals. A goal may be or include any purpose target objective mark etc. In some embodiments a goal may be tied to a standard reflected by the standards data. In other embodiments a goal may be loosely related or unrelated to the standards data. For instance the goal may be targeted to specific needs of a school system educator employee etc. A goal that is tied to a standard may include related objectives that must be met for the goal to be considered achieved. A workflow is based on the goal s and defines the mode e.g. process for achieving it. A workflow may include assessment and or process templates.

An assessment template is a user definable electronic form for assessing how a target user is performing relative to one or more criteria e.g. goals workflows standards etc. . The assessment template can be used for a self assessment or an assessment of a user by another user e.g. an administrator a subordinate a peer a third party etc. . In some embodiments the assessment template includes assessment fields for describing the performance e.g. compliance effectiveness achievement attainment efficacy attitude perception etc. of the target user relative to the criterion. The assessment templates may also include assignment fields for recommending assigning and or integrating electronic resources e.g. video and fields for defining assignment parameters for the electronic resources e.g. task timers wait times etc. . The assignment fields may be populated with electronic resources defined in a corresponding process template or that are user defined directly. Additionally or alternatively the assessment module may provide electronic resource suggestions for assignment via the assignment fields as discussed in further detail below.

By way of example an administrator user may define an assessment template to include performance rubrics questions regarding user performance relative to the performance rubrics user configurable answers to the questions which gauge the target user s performance comment fields for providing a description of a target user s performance video and or photos to be taken during an assessment demonstrating effectiveness or samples of effectiveness etc. The assessment templates are advantageous is a number of respects including providing an administrator with the ability to specify the criteria by which the performance of the members of the organization he or she administrates is measured and the type and content of assessment data that should be collected.

A process template is a user definable form for establishing a process for achieving the goals and tracking progress. In some embodiments the process templates can be defined to include one or more practical steps for achieving the goal s . For example a process template may set forth one or more meetings events activities professional development resources and assessments etc. as well as a schedule for completing these items. In a further example the process template can be used to manage professional development. For instance the process template may establish an organization wide development plan and may specify the electronic resources that each member of the organization must consume i.e. read view interact with share etc. within a certain timeframe. For example in an educational setting the process template may assign professional development activities that each educator must complete according to schedule including for example one or more of online training videos the educators much watch online communities the educators must participate in electronic books the educators must read and tools the educators must use to map their curriculum develop their lesson plans develop their own personal development plans etc.

In some embodiments a user interacting with the management module via the client application may define a new goal or workflow or modify an existing goal or workflow. For example the user may define or modify a goal and or workflow and may transmit data describing the definition or modification via the network to server for processing and storage by the management module . In some instances when defining or modifying a workflow a user may via the client application refer back to previously created workflows and goals for reference or may copy an existing goal or workflow and modify it. In some embodiments the management module ensures proper procedures are being followed and provides reminders to the users. For instance a workflow e.g. a process template and or assessment template may include a requirement that certain procedures and protocols be adhered by the users and a setting instructing the management module to track compliance with these procedures and protocols and or remind the users e.g. via electronic message about the procedures and protocols. The management module may track compliance by using the analytics data achievement data assessment data and other data stored in the data stores of the server to determine whether such procedures and protocols are being followed.

In some embodiments the management module is coupled to the data store to store management data describing the goals and workflows for access and retrieval by the other components of the application engine . For example data reflecting the goals and workflows is accessible from the data store by the analytics module and the reporting module for analysis and inclusion in reports respectively.

The content module is software code logic or routines for providing electronic resources for consumption and tracking user consumption and interaction with those electronic resources. In some embodiments the content module can catalog the electronic resources provide for the addition or removal of electronic resources transmit the electronic resources to the users of the service for consumption track user consumption and interaction with the of electronic resources personalize electronic resources to the preferences of the users or to address the needs of the users etc. The users may be registered or unregistered users.

The content module is capable of receiving requests for electronic resources from users and fulfilling those requests by transmitting instances of the electronic resources to the corresponding client devices of the users or facilitating the transmission of instances of the resources by the media distribution server e.g. by providing an object or code e.g. a media player object to the client device that is operable to access the resources via the media distribution server . By way of example the content module may receive a request from a client device of a user via the network to view a training video that was assigned to the user by an observer while observing that user in action. In another example upon logging in to the service a user may be presented with an interface by a client application operable on the client device that shows any outstanding assignments that the user must complete the dates by the assignments must be completed a description of what the assignments are etc. Example assignments include but are not limited to requiring users to view a video upload a video create a lesson plan provide a lesson plan map curriculum attend an event e.g. class provide student work provide student assessment or achievement data receive mentoring etc. Using this interface the user may select an assignment in response to which the client application transmits a request to the content module for the electronic resource associated with the assignment. The content module upon receiving this request may locate the electronic resource in the media data store and provide it to the client application via the network for presentation to the user . The content module may in some embodiments cooperate with the media distribution server to provide the electronic resources for consumption and or interaction by the users requesting them.

The content module can also receive e.g. from a client device of a user a new electronic resource along with metadata for it and store it in the media data store or the data store delete or inactivate an electronic resource stored in the media data store or the data store and update a resource library database either periodically or real time with any new electronic resources that have been added to inactivated or removed from the service. In some embodiments the content module may be coupled to the media data store either directly or via the media distribution server to access electronic resources stored therein. The electronic resources may be stored in and or distributed across one or more data stores such as the media data store and the data store .

The content module may personalize the electronic resources it provides. In some embodiments the content module can cooperate with the assessment module to personalize the electronic resource to a need of a target user based on an assessment as discussed in further detail below with reference to at least the assessment module . In other embodiments the content module can customize the content of the electronic resources based on performance related data e.g. assessment data achievement data analytics data etc. interaction data demographics data and or any other data stored in the data stores of the system and or the server . For instance based on a need reflected the performance related data the content module may adjust the content of an electronic resource being provided to the user to address that need. As a further example the content module may provide the user with a specific video example or an electronic book having customized chapters or sections that teach additional skills and provide additional information on a topic that the user is struggling with or may provide recommendations of supplemental resources containing such material. The content module may be coupled to the various data stores of the system and the server to retrieve the data stored therein and personalize the electronic resources.

When users consume or interact with the electronic resources provided by the content module the content module is capable of logging the consumption and interaction in the data store in association with those users. In some embodiments the content module may cooperate with the client application to log any user interactions with the electronic resources. For example when a user interacts with a user interface generated and displayed by the client application the client application may send interaction data via the network to the content module for storage and analysis. Additionally or alternatively the content module may receive interaction data from the media distribution server . The interaction data may include but is not limited to the identity of the electronic resource that was interacted with the identity of the user the time and date of the interactions the actions the user took e.g. selected or hovered over a user interface element such as a hyperlink menu element input field pause button play button scrubbing dial volume dial etc. maximized the viewing field added a comment paged through the resource downloaded a file completed a survey viewed an embedded video shared a resource with social network connections etc.

By way of further example when a user accesses an electronic resource pages through an electronic book downloads files included with or embedded in a webpage complete a survey associated with any electronic resource views a video file listens to an audio file comments on passages of an interactive electronic book submits lesson plans submits curriculum maps downloads documents uploads files including video audio text graphics etc. e.g. a work sample participates in communities groups defined by his her social graph or otherwise uses any other functionality provided by the client application to interact with an electronic resource the content module receives interaction data describing these interactions from the client application or another entity of the system such as the media distribution server and stores interaction data describing the interaction in the data store .

The assessment module is software code logic or routines for assessing user performance. The assessment module may in some embodiments provide for observance and assessment of the performance of users and those they oversee or teach receive process and store assessment data provide recommendations for one or more electronic resources based on assessment data to address needs reflected by the assessment data assign electronic resources based on assessment data for completion by users etc.

In addition to its plain and ordinary meaning assessing a user s performance may include qualitatively or quantitatively assessing a user s compliance effectiveness achievement attainment efficacy attitude perception etc. relative to one or more criteria such as goals and or workflows defined via the management module and stored in the data store and or the standards reflected by the standards data stored in the data store and or the standards data store . A performance assessment may reflect relative to one or more criteria e.g. goals standards etc. a user s current performance level a performance trend over a particular time period a past performance level a cumulative performance level a specific performance level an overall performance level etc. hereinafter referred to as performance level . The performance assessments may be formal or informal. For example a performance assessment performed by the assessment module may reflect a formal annual evaluation submitted to an human resources department or informal assessment of a user conducted to provide the user with feedback on the state of his or her development.

In some embodiments the assessment module may assess a user s performance by receiving assessment data that includes a performance assessment from a user. The performance assessment may reflect a self assessment or an assessment performed by another such as an observer. For example the assessment data may include observation data characterizing one or more aspects of a target user s performance during an observation session performed by the observer. Continuing this example the observer who is interacting with the assessment module via the client application may input observations that are provided as observation data to the assessment module and the assessment module may store the assessment data in association with the target user and or the observer in a data store such as the data store . In another example video cameras may be used as an observation tool. For instance a video camera placed in the vicinity of a target subject e.g. a classroom and may be used to record how the target subject is performing in his her job e.g. teaching his her students . The video recording may then be submitted as observation data to the assessment module e.g. by the video camera by a user via a client device etc. . In some instances the video recording may be submitted by an observer of the target subject along with observations input by the observer. In some instances the video recording may be viewed by the target subject or another individual such as an administrator peer etc. via a user interface presented on a client device and observations about the target subject s performance may be submitted via the interface as observation data to the assessment module for storage in association with the video. In some embodiments the assessment module stores the assessment data it receives in association with assessment data aggregated by other components of the application engine such as the aggregator for later access and retrieval by the other components of the application engine such as the analytics module and the reporting module .

The assessment module is capable of suggesting one or more electronic resources for assignment to a target user. The suggestion may be based on the assessment data it receives a related goal or workflow a combination of the foregoing etc. For example based on observation data received from an observer or a user performing a self assessment the assessment module can identify one or more electronic resources that correspond to the observation data a workflow including a goal that the target user has been required to meet a combination of the foregoing etc. and recommend them for assignment to the target user. In response the user e.g. observer target user etc. interacting with the assessment module may assign the recommended electronic resource s and the target user upon accessing the application engine via an associated interface may be presented with the electronic resource and or options for interacting with the electronic resource s and thus completing the assignment. The assessment module can identify the electronic resource s based on or a combination of the workflow and the assessment data.

In some embodiments to identify one or more electronic resources for recommendation the assessment module can compare one or more of observation data a goal and a workflow to metadata stored with the electronic resources to identify resources that match. In other embodiments the assessment module can cooperate with the content module to identify the electronic resources to recommend. In yet other embodiments another module such as a recommendation engine not shown included in the application engine may identify the resources and provide the recommendations.

In some embodiments the assessment module may provide assessment templates defined via the management module for completion by the users that are performing the assessments. For example the assessment module may provide an assessment template to a user who is observing a target user or to a target user who is performing a self assessment. That user may input assessment related information into the user completable fields of the template and save the information to an observation file either by submitting it via the client application to the assessment module for storage as assessment data in the data store in association with the target user and observer if applicable or by saving it locally for later revision submission. The assessment template may also include header fields for describing the circumstances surrounding the assessment. For instance the assessment template may include fields for describing the identity a target user the date the assessment was performed the identity of the observer s and how the results of the assessment should be distributed and stored etc. The assessment module is coupled to the data stores and or via the bus to store and manipulate data including assessment data.

The analytics module is software code logic or routines for analyzing data processed by or accessible to the application engine and generating effectiveness analytics based thereon. More particularly the analytics module can analyze the data processed by the management module content module assessment module and aggregator to generate analytics reflecting how the users of an organization are performing relative to a goal standard workflow etc. Examples of analytics that can be generated include but are not limited to user performance organization performance rater reliability electronic resource effectiveness etc.

The following examples are provided to further illustrate various types of analytics that the analytics module can generate by analyzing one or more of the assessment achievement standards management demographics interaction and content data. It should be understood that like all examples discussed herein that these examples should not be construed as limiting but as illustrative of the structure and functionality of the analytics module .

As a first example the analytics module can determine whether one or more users are in compliance with one or more measurement criteria by analyzing performance related data e.g. assessment data achievement data etc. and data reflecting the criteria e.g. assessment data standards data management data etc. . For instance in an educational setting the analytics module can analyze the assessments student test scores and other related information to a determine if that educator s performance is complaint with an applicable standard goal workflow etc. b evaluate the educator s performance over time c determine if that educator s performance is trending upwards i.e. improving or downwards worsening d determine if an educator needs additional training based on that educator s performance etc.

As a second example the analytics module can determine user and organization performance levels based on one or more of assessment achievement standards and management data. For instance the analytics module can determine the performance level of a user by comparing achievement data associated with individuals that the user oversees or teaches to standards data. As a further example in an educational setting the analytics module can compare the standardized test scores e.g. achievement data of the students being taught by an educator to applicable testing standards e.g. as defined by the standards data management data etc. to determine if they meet the standards minimum requirements and then determine the performance level of the educator based on that comparison. In this way the analytics module could determine whether the educator is struggling meeting standards or exceeding standards e.g. is a leader . In another instance the analytics module can base the analytics it generates on multiple performance related data points to ensure the performance level being determined for each educator reliably reflects that educator s effectiveness. This may include analyzing the assessment data related to an educator e.g. formative assessments summative assessments student assessments peer reviews formal evaluations student work samples etc. and or the achievement data of the educator s students e.g. standardized test scores relative to the standards and or management data e.g. applicable standards goals workflows etc. .

As a third example the analytics module can determine how users are progressing in achieving the goals of a workflow applicable to them. For instance the analytics module can analyze the assessment data and or achievement data associated with the users to determine if the users are meeting the steps defined in a process template of the workflow or the standards defined in an assessment template of the workflow. In further instances the analytics module can how effectively the users of an organization are performing by determining how the users are progressing relative to goal s of a workflow including calculating performance trends relative to the goal s identifying the areas in which users are deficient determining whether the deficiencies are systemic determining whether the deficiencies identified are isolated or unique to a particular demographic determining organization wide deficiencies identifying which electronic resources consumed by or assigned to the users of the organization have been effective at helping the users improve and which have not etc. Additionally in an educational setting the analytics module may determine if the educators and students are in compliance with standards applicable to them whether the educators and students performance has decreased or increased over time e.g. the school year whether non compliant educators and students largely belong to a particular demographic e.g. speak English as a second language are of a particular race or gender have special needs live in a particular location have a particular socio economic status a combination of the foregoing etc. whether the resources used by the educators for professional development help the educators to improve over time etc.

As a third example the analytics module can generate user and organization performance scores based on the performance related e.g. assessment data achievement data interaction data etc. and data reflecting one or more measurement criteria e.g. the assessment data management data standards data that are applicable to them. The scoring can be an aggregate or individualized score based on a performance trend and can be produced based on rater reliability etc. In some instances the analytics module can calculate aggregate and individual performance scores for the users and organizations based on the performance levels it determines and or the performance levels previously determined by other entities of the system and included in the performance related data e.g. assessment data achievement data etc. . For instance the analytics module may calculate an effectiveness score for a given user based on one or more assessments of that user s performance e.g. performed in association with the assessment module .

As a fourth example the analytics module can determine the reliability e.g. accuracy consistency quality dependability etc. of the performance assessments of target users based on assessment and achievement data. For instance the analytics module can compare an achievement based assessment e.g. achievement data and an observation based assessment e.g. assessment data to determine if the observation based performance assessment of the target user is reliable. The reliability of the observation based performance assessment can be determined by the analytics module based on whether the achievement based and the observation based performance assessments are consistent. For instance the analytics module may determine the observation based performance assessment to be unreliable if the observation based performance assessment is negative and the achievement based performance assessment is positive or conversely if the observation based performance assessment is positive and the achievement based performance assessment is negative. Further the analytics module may determine the observation based performance assessment to be reliable if both the observation based performance and achievement based performance assessments were negative or positive. However if the both the observation based performance and the achievement based performance assessments were neutral the analytics module may determine that the reliability of the performance assessment made the by the observer could not be verified.

As a fifth example the analytics module can determine the reliability e.g. accuracy consistency quality dependability etc. of the performance assessments and use those determinations to evaluate the effectiveness of those users who are performing the assessments. In some embodiments to make this reliability determination the analytics module compares various criteria. The criteria could be any measurement criteria such as metrics observations evaluations effectiveness evidence achievements student assessment data etc. For instance the analytics module can compare a first user s assessment of a target user to other users assessments of the same target user to determine the reliability of the first user s assessment. In some instances this comparison constitutes a rater reliability determination. In other instances the analytics module can compare assessments performed via the assessment module to aggregated rater reliability data inter intra etc. to verify the accuracy of the performance assessments. In a further example if the assessment of a target user by a first observer is grossly inconsistent with the observational assessments of that target user by other observers on the same or similar subject matter the observational assessment of the first observer may be flagged and reported by the reporting module to an administrator of the observer for further review scrutiny. However if they are consistent then the analytics module may record this as evidence of the assessment accuracy and reliability. In another instance the analytics module may analyze the observation files for some or all target users observed by the observer to determine the level and quality of feedback provided by the observer about those subjects. If the analytics module determines that the assessments e.g. answers ratings comments etc. for the target users made by the observer in the observation files are all the same or substantially similar the analytics module may determine that the observer is simply making the same assessments for each target user and is not performing the assessments as required. The analytics module may also make a determination as to the quality of one or more assessments performed by an observer based on the level and or variety of feedback included in the observation file s for one or more target users.

As a sixth example the analytics module can determine a developmental need of a user and then identify one or more training resources that cater to that need based on the performance level of the user and the content of the electronic resources. For instance the assessment data for a given educator may reflect that the educator is performing or progressing poorly relative to a particular standard goal workflow etc. and the analytics module can query the content data or interact with the content module to identify a digital video that provides instruction and teaches skills to improve relative to that standard goal workflow etc.

As a seventh example the analytics module can evaluate whether the electronic resources consumed by the users helped them to improve relative to one or more measurement criteria by analyzing performance related data e.g. assessment and or achievement data and interaction data. This analysis can advantageously identify whether the electronic resources are effective or ineffective and should be recommended for further assignment to users. For example if an educator completed an electronic resource assignment made by an administrator to address a deficiency and in a later assessment was found to not have improved the analytics module can identify the electronic resource as having been ineffective for that user and store or provide analysis data evidencing such for provision to the educator s administrator in a report. In a further example if that same resource is identified as having been ineffective for several users the analytics module may record evidence of such for provision in a report to the administrator. In some instances the analytics module may determine the effectiveness of the resources based on the level and or pervasiveness of the users improvements.

As an eighth example the analytics module may generate user alignments. A user alignment may connect two or more users based on one or more compatibility matches. Users may be matched as compatible by the analytics module based on one or more common or compatible attributes as reflected by the demographics data content data interaction data standards data assessment data achievement data profile data a social graph stored in the data store etc. The alignment module may access the data from the data stores and or or may receive it directly from the other modules of the application engine . Non limiting examples of user alignments include colleague alignments mentor alignments learning community alignments etc. As a further example a user alignment may align one or more users with high performance levels relative to an applicable standard and one or more users with low performance levels relative to the same or an associated standard to provide mentoring for the one or more underperforming users. For example the alignment module may determine based on assessment data achievement data and standards data which educators are highly proficient relative to various standards and which educators are poorly proficient relative to those standards and may align the highly proficient educators to be mentors to the poorly proficient educators. In another example the user alignment may align two or more users whose performance levels meet or exceed an applicable standard for example to form a leadership or mentors group. Conversely two or more users with low performance levels may be aligned for training collaboration and support.

As a ninth example the analytics module can compare performance related data e.g. assessment data achievement data etc. of the users of different organizations to determine which organizations have the most effective users and then identify the workflows that those organizations used to achieve effectiveness. The analytics module can tag these effective workflows as preferred and store them as recommendations for other organizations in reports generated by the reporting module . In some instances analytics module can compare demographics data of effective organizations to that of a target organization that is struggling to identify an effective organization having characteristics similar to the target organization. The analytics module can then recommend a workflow which was used by the effective organization to overcome various challenges facing the target organization to the target organization. This is advantageous as it provides the target organization with a workflow that has been proven to be effective and is targeted to the demographics and needs of the target organization.

The analytics module is capable of segmenting the analytics it generates based on data type or attribute including for example demographics performance user attributes standards goals and. For instance in an educational setting the analytics may be segmented by individual pupils educators administrators etc. groups of pupils educators administrators region district school classroom grade location educator student class size gender ethnicity race spoken language educator attributes student attributes public policy legislation standards goals workflows requirements performance level performance score assessments achievements or the like.

The analytics module is communicatively coupled to the data stores and and is capable of accessing the data stored by the data stores and to generate the analytics described herein. Additionally the analytics module is capable of storing the analytics it generates in a data store such as the data store for later access and retrieval by the other components of the application engine such as the reporting module and or the management module . Additionally or alternatively the analytics module can provide the analytics it generates directly to the other components of the application engine such as reporting module and or the management module for use thereby.

The reporting module is software code logic or routines for generating and sending the reports to users of the application engine for presentation. In some embodiments the reports are rich informative reports describing the effectiveness of an organization its users and or the electronic resources provided for the development of those users relative to various goals standards and workflows.

In some embodiments the reporting module generates the reports based on the analytics produced by the analytics module and or the data generated or aggregated by the application engine or the components thereof. The reporting module may be coupled to the various data stores and of the system and or the server to retrieve the data stored therein. In some embodiments the reporting module may signal the analytics module to generate analytics data. For example the reporting module may specify to the analytics module the type of analytics that it needs generated or the analytics module may independently make this determination based on pre defined parameters or information. Once the analytics have been generated the analytics module may provide them directly to the reporting module or may store them in a data store such as the data store for access by the reporting module . For example the reporting module may be communicatively coupled to the analytics module or a data store such as the data store to receive analytics data for the user s and may generate the report to include the analytics data e.g. effectiveness score s to give the user designated to receive and interpret the report an indication as to how various user s are performing. The reporting module may be coupled to the analytics module e.g. via the processor to receive the analytics data.

While the reporting module and analytics module are depicted as monolithic entities it should be understood that these entities may take other forms. For instance the reporting module and analytics module may be integrated into a signal entity or divided into additional functional components and still fall within the scope of this disclosure.

The reporting module is capable of generating a report in response to receiving a trigger signal. In some embodiments the trigger signal may be provided by the management module . For instance a user interacting with the management module may request a progress report for a workflow that has been defined and responsive to receiving this signal the reporting module may generate the report based on the management data associated with the workflow the users associated with the workflow and the data associated with those users including one or more of analytics data assessment data achievement data demographics data standards data user profile data interaction data etc. The reporting module may then provide the report to the management module for provision to the user or may provide it directly to the user e.g. via the communication unit and the network .

In other embodiments the trigger signal may be received in the form of a report request provided by a user via a client application . For example an administrator of an organization may input a command into his her user device via the client application commanding that a report be generated describing the effectiveness of a specific branch of his organization. Responsive to receiving the command the client application may generate and send a report request via the network to the reporting module thus triggering the reporting module to generate and send the report for presentation. In yet other embodiments the trigger signal may be provided by the assessment module the analytics module or the aggregator .

The reporting module is capable of automatically and independently generating reports at various intervals times etc. For example the reporting module may automatically generate reports for some or all of the organizations and or users registered to use the educational platform provided by the application engine . In some embodiments the reporting module may provide the report for presentation via the dashboard of the client application provide the report for download as a portable document transmit the report via electronic message e.g. via email instant message text message etc. to one or more users etc.

The reporting module may store any reports and or data generated by it in a data store such as the data store for later access by the reporting module or any other component of the professional development server such as the management module the content module the assessment module or the reporting module itself.

In some embodiments the reports generated by the reporting module can organize the analytics generated by the analytics module as well as goals and workflows defined via the management module into an accessible and easy to consume format. In some embodiments these reports are viewable via a dashboard presented by the client application . For example the dashboard can provide a user such as an administrator with detailed information about an organization s effectiveness in achieving established goals and workflows and providing the user with informative graphical detail and rich analytics that make it easy for the user to quickly ascertain how well the organization is performing. The dashboard can also provide the user with cascading levels of analytical detail that he or she can easily drill down into to view the data in more granular segments. For example the data in the reports may be segmented as described above with respect to the analytics module and the user may filter the data using those segments to better understand the make up of his her organization reveal deficiencies or proficiencies that may be unique to a particular segment as well as the factors that may be causing those deficiencies or proficiencies. In a further example the data in the reports can be viewed to follow any hierarchical or non hierarchical structure. For instance the data may be viewed by nation area state region district school grade level classroom educator subject state common core national international standard student performance level content consumed evaluator observer student demographic data e.g. income level race etc. professional learning community or any other data type demographic or category discussed herein.

By way of example in an educational setting a school principal may be performing annual evaluations of his her educators or visiting the classrooms of a number of his her educators to perform observational assessments. During these engagements the principal may using the dashboard displayed on his her wirelessly connected client device e.g. tablet computer view an overall performance score and summary for that educator view the educator s performance over time view assessment and achievement data e.g. teacher or student for that educator including any formal and informal assessments student reviews parent reviews peer reviews the test scores of the educator s students the perceptions of the educator s students determine the deficiencies the educator has has been working on or has been improving on view any electronic resources the educator has been assigned view the electronic resources the educator has consumed view any work product lesson plans curriculum maps videos presentations etc. the educator has uploaded the professional learning communities and groups the educator has interacted with any mentors coaches etc. the educator has been working with etc. Using this information the principal may quickly get up to speed on where each educator is at and may use this information in managerial decisions and to modify existing or define new goals and workflows and assign electronic resources to help the users of the organization individually and collectively become more effective.

As a further example the reporting module can give one or more users e.g. supervisors administrators executives directors managers principals assistant principals reviewers observers etc. feedback on the effectiveness of an organization its goals and management processes and workflow its users the assessments of those users the electronic resources consumed by and assigned to those users etc. This allows the one or more users receiving the feedback to be adaptive and make any necessary adjustments such as modifying existing or setting new goals workflows electronic resource assignments user alignments etc. targeting user needs and weaknesses by assigning resources that training and resources that are proven to help users address these needs and weaknesses identify which electronic resources have been ineffective align users determined to be effective as mentors to those that are struggling taking disciplinary action making structural changes to the organization etc.

In addition the reports generated by the reporting module may include recommendations for user alignments and electronic resources. For instance the report may recommend mentors for the users learning communities for the users to participate in colleagues who teach the same subject have the same student mix or have other attributes in common with the user for the user to connect with recommend electronic resources for users to consume based on their needs summarize electronic resource assignments etc. which can provide the benefit of helping the educators become better at working with and teaching their students and ultimately preparing them all to be college and career ready. In another example if an observer assigns a target user to watch a video on achieving effective classroom management via the professional development service the reporting module can generate status updates about the target user s progress on watching the video and send them to the observer. The reporting module can also report on the target user s additional efforts to develop his her skills by reporting on what other electronic training resources the target user has consumed since the observer made the assignment provided the target user provides his her consent for doing so via an associated privacy settings interface.

The application engine or any of its components and provide data to client devices may provide the data with presentational information and the client application may use the presentational information to form the look and feel of the user interfaces. In other implementations the client application receiving the data may determine the formatting and look and feel of the user interfaces independently. Using the user interfaces presented by the client application such as the interface in the user can input commands selecting various actions.

The aggregator is software code logic or routines for aggregating data from various information sources that can be used for making assessments and generating analytics reports and the like. The aggregator may aggregate via the communication unit the data from various information sources coupled to the network e.g. etc. and store it locally in one or more data stores. In some embodiments the aggregator replicates the data stored in remote instances of data stores and in local instances of those data stores. In other embodiments the aggregator can store the data aggregated from the remote sources in the data store . In yet other embodiments some or all of the data aggregation can be omitted by incorporating one or more of the data stores and into the server .

In some embodiments the aggregator may aggregate the data at regular intervals. For example a batch program operating periodically every few minutes hours days weeks etc. may replicate the data stored in data stores and to one or more data stores of the server . In other embodiments the aggregator may retrieve data real time.

Data aggregated or generated by the aggregator and the other modules of the application engine including for example content module the assessment module and the reporting module is collectively referred to as aggregated data. For example aggregated data may include but is not limited to demographics data content data interaction data standards data achievement data assessment data perceptions data and profile data.

Additional structure and functionality of various elements of the application engine and the system are further described below with reference to .

In block the method can provide electronic resources to one or more users of the organization using the educational platform. The electronic resources may be tied to the goal workflow. For instance the workflow may set forth a development plan for the users of the organization to follow and specify electronic resources for the users to consume. As a further example a user upon logging in to utilize the educational platform can be presented with an interface by the content module that includes a summary of the electronic resources that have been specified for the user to consume in a process template associated with a workflow. In other instances the method proceeds to block without providing electronic resources to some or all of the users.

The method then assesses in block one or more users associated with the organization. The method may assess a user by determining an assessment of a target user s performance. The assessment can be based on a workflow defined in block . In some instances the assessment is determined at least in part using assessment and or achievement data such as assessment data received from an observer of the target user or assessment and or achievement data aggregated from one or more information sources.

In block the method can personalize learning for the target users based on the performance assessments. In some instances to personalize learning the method can in block personalize one or more electronic resources to address one or more needs of one or more target users based on the performance assessments determined in block . For example to personalize an electronic resource to the target user the assessment module can determine an electronic resource based on the assessment of a performance of the target user and assign the electronic resource to the target user for completion. In another example to personalize the electronic resource the assessment module can signal the content module to adapt a content of the electronic resource to address a need of the first user as reflected by the assessment of the performance.

The one or more personalized resources can then be provided by the method to the one or more corresponding target users for consumption. In some instances the learning of the user s can further be personalized using the same additional or replacement electronic resources by repeating the operations in blocks and . For instance after a target user has completed the assignment of an electronic resource the performance of a target user can be re assessed in block to determine whether the user has improved and or is using the techniques skill taught by the electronic resource.

Next the method can generate effectiveness analytics in block describing for example the effectiveness of the electronic resources an organization its one or more users etc. In some instances the method can generate an effectiveness report and provide it to one or more users for presentation. In some instances the effectiveness report is generated based on analytics data. Additionally or alternatively the report may include other data received and or stored by the server such as the management data assessment data e.g. observation data achievement data demographics data standards data interaction data etc. In one non limiting example when generating an effectiveness report the method can calculate one or more effectiveness scores e.g. effectiveness analytics for one or more users to be included in the report based on the performance assessments of those users and generate the report to include the effectiveness score s .

The method is advantageous in a number of respects including for instance providing users with personalized learning targeted to the needs of a user based on the user s performance progress and providing administrators with effectiveness analytics that can help them optimize their organizations goals workflows e.g. internal processes resource assignments etc. and filter out the electronic resources that are not effective.

The method continues by receiving an instruction in block based on the report. In some instances the instruction may be received from a target user described in the report or from a user that oversees the target user such as a supervisor or administrator. The method then determines in blocks and whether the instruction is an instruction to modify a goal or workflow assess one or more users or personalize learning for one or more users respectively. In particular if the method determines in block to modify a goal or in block to modify a workflow the method proceeds to block or respectively and re determines one or more goals or one or more workflows respectively. For instance in an educational setting the method enables a principal of a school to adjust or replace a school wide goal and or workflow responsive to receiving a report about the effectiveness of his her educators. If the method determines in block to assess one or more users the method continues to block or and proceeds with the assessment or re assessment. Similarly if the method determines in block to personalize the learning of one or more users the method proceeds to block to personalize the one or more electronic resources for example by assigning or re assigning electronic resources or by customizing a content of the electronic resources to the needs of the users. Once the processing in blocks and is complete the method may terminate or may continue processing each subsequent block through to block where a report is generated to reflect any changes.

The method is advantageous in a number of respects including providing users continuous feedback as to their own effectiveness the effectiveness of the users and organizations that they oversee and the electronic resources used by them. This enables users particularly those in administrative roles to make adjustments to the goals workflows development plans resource assignments etc. in an effort to adapt to and meet the needs of the users and organizations they oversee and thereby increase the overall effectiveness of those users and organizations.

Next the method provides the one or more electronic resources for assignment to the target user. In some embodiments a summary of the one or more electronic resources are provided to an observer such as a supervisor or administrator for assignment to target user that he she is observing. For example the client device of the observer may receive a summary of training videos and may display the summary to the observer via a user interface. The observer may use the interface to preview the videos or other resources and or assign one or more of the videos or other resources to the target user.

Next the method receives an assignment of one or more electronic resources in block and assigns the one or more electronic resources to the target user. In some embodiments the assignment includes parameters governing how the assignment of the electronic resource s is to be completed. For example an assignment parameter could include a due date a level of interaction with the electronic resource that is required to complete the assignment an additional requirement that must be satisfied for completion of the assignment etc. In some embodiments the one or more electronic resources are assigned by associating them with the target user. For instance the assessment module or another component of the application engine can store record of the assignment in the data store in association with a user profile of the target user.

It should be understood that the embodiments described in this disclosure are provided by way of illustration and example and should not be considered limiting and that other variations and combinations of these embodiments are contemplated and within the scope of the present disclosure. Moreover unless stated otherwise the various different embodiments described herein should not be considered as being mutually exclusive and can be integrated in various ways or may be further divided into various discrete devices components and methods. For example various operations of the method may be expanded upon by operations included in one or more of methods and or by concatenating and or substituting various blocks from these methods all of which are encompassed by the present disclosure. Further it should be understood that in some instances the methods may be iterated more than one time to produce additional results. Additionally the usage of the terms first second etc. in various places in this disclosure does not necessarily imply a specific order or rank and is used in some cases to help the reader discern between various objects items elements etc.

Referring now to an example effectiveness report is described. It should be understood that the report illustrated in is provided merely by way of example and that other reports containing different or additional information may be generated and presented. For example various user interfaces may be produced to display reports and statistics display dialogs define goals and workflows set parameters and settings conduct assessments provide recommendations send electronic communications view listen to and or interact with the electronic resources provided by the professional development service etc.

In the depicted embodiment example report is displayed via a user interface including various interactive user interface elements. In this particular example the example report includes a date selector meta data fields a score indicator and a summary region . The date selector allows the viewing user to limit the information in the report to a certain date range or to remove any date range restrictions. The metadata fields include information about the educator and the users who have assessed the performance of the educator. The score indicator depicts an overall score rating the educator s effectiveness which is calculated based on the educator s performance relative the indicators e.g. goals standards etc. depicted in the summary region .

The summary region includes information describing the performance of the educator of a school e.g. Middleville Elementary relative to the indicators e.g. goals which may be defined in a workflow such as in a process or assessment template. The summary region also includes a chart charting the educator s performance progress over time the resources that have been prescribed assigned to the educator and whether the educator completed those assignments and suggestions for additional resources that can be assigned. For example selection of the title of a prescribed resource may display a window or dialog including information about the assignment of that resource options to preview the electronic resource e.g. video and information about the resource others who have consumed it and its effectiveness. In another example selection of the title Search for Resources may display a window or dialog for searching for a resource related to the corresponding indicator or for searching for any electronic resource applicable to the educator. While not depicted other user interfaces for viewing the information or performing the functionality described in this disclosure are also contemplated and fall within its scope. These include for instance user interface elements for navigating to viewing and editing goals and workflows viewing the observation files performing assessments viewing and navigating analytics demographics user standards assessment achievement interaction management data etc. receiving and sending electronic messages or the like.

Various embodiments for managing user development and effectiveness have been described. In the above description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It should be understood that the technology described in the various example embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description.

Reference in the present disclosure to some embodiments an embodiment an example embodiment other embodiments etc. means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the description. The appearances of the phrase in some embodiments in various places in the present disclosure are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiments.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms including for example processing or computing or calculating or ranking or identifying or determining or displaying or receiving or conducting or collecting or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present embodiment of the present disclosure also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may include a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium including for example any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards flash memories including USB keys with non volatile memory or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions each coupled to a computer system bus.

The present disclosure can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In some embodiments the present disclosure is implemented in software which includes but is not limited to firmware resident software microcode etc.

Furthermore the description can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description a computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain store communicate propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device.

A data processing system suitable for storing and or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code bulk storage and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input output or I O devices including but not limited to keyboards displays pointing devices etc. can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I O controllers.

Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems cable modems wireless adapters and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

Finally the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description. In addition the present disclosure is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the present disclosure as described herein.
