title: Sending text messages to multiple devices using a joint services account
abstract: A network device receives a message that identifies a relationship between a wireless user device and a client device, the relationship allowing text messages, intended for the wireless user device, to be sent to the client device. The network device stores the information identifying the relationship. The network device receives a text message intended for the wireless user device. The network device determines to send the text message to the client device, based on the information identifying the relationship stored by the network device; and the network device sends the text message to the client device for display on a display device associated with the client device.

A user using a first user device may send a text message using the short message service hereinafter referred to as SMS protocol to a second user device being used by another user. These text messages may be known as SMS messages.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Systems and or methods described herein may set up and activate a joint account that allows for sending SMS messages intended for wireless user device to one or more other devices such as a set top box. For example a user may set up a joint account that allows for selecting to send a SMS message intended for display on a wireless user device associated with one account to another device e.g. a set top box associated with another account. Once the joint account is created a user may receive SMS messages via the wireless user device and via the other device whenever an SMS message is sent to the wireless user device.

While the following description focuses on SMS message it will be appreciated that systems and or methods described herein are equally applicable to other types of text messages such as multimedia message services MMS messages text message service TMS messages or other types of text messages.

Mary enters her login information e.g. user ID and password for her account with ABC Cable. Once the ABC cable account login information is validated the web page may request Mary to select the type of content that Mary would like to have sent to her cable television account. Mary decides to select SMS messages.

As shown in the web page may display information to Mary about the available user devices that can receive the SMS message. For example the web page may display all of the set top boxes that are used in Mary s cable television service from ABC Cable. Also the web page may display all of the wireless devices that Mary has with XYZ Wireless. Mary has the option to send content such as SMS messages intended for her smart phone to one or more of the set top boxes. Mary also has the option of choosing to send content intended for Simon s smart phone to one or more of the set top boxes. As shown in Mary decides to select to send SMS messages intended for Mary s smart phone labeled as Mary on the web page to the set top box in the living room.

Mary may also have other options for sending content. Mary may be able to send SMS messages according to the time of day. For example Mary may decide that she would like to have incoming SMS messages intended for her smart phone to be sent to the living room set top box only during certain times of the day. Mary may also have the option to suspend receiving SMS messages. For example Mary may decide to go on vacation and may be able to temporarily suspend sending text messages to the living room set top box. Mary may also be able to block text messages. For example Mary may decide that SMS messages from her sister s smart phone to Mary s smart phone should not be sent to the living room set top box.

With all the information provided for the joint account the web page may provide Mary with a joint account identifier and password. In the future Mary may use the joint account identifier and password to login into the joint account to perform actions related to sending content to user devices serviced by XYZ Wireless and ABC Cable.

As shown in Jane using her smart phone sends a SMS message to Mary s smart phone. Mary s smart phone may be on or off. Assume that Mary s smart phone is on. At the time Jane sends the SMS message to Mary Mary is exercising in front of the living room television and Mary has left her smart phone in the bedroom. When Mary s smart phone receives the SMS message from Jane s smart phone Jane s SMS message is also communicated to a set top box in the living room that provides content to a living room television. The living room set top box sends the text message to the living room television. The living room television receives the SMS message from Jane s smart phone and the SMS message Message from Jane Mary quit working out Let s have lunch may be displayed on the living room television.

As a result a user may be able to receive a SMS message intended for one user device e.g. a smart phone on one or more other user devices. This may provide the user with a level of flexibility in their ability to view a SMS message on different user devices associated with different service providers.
