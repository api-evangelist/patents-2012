This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 451 874 entitled Systems and Methods of QoS for Single Stream ICA and filed on Mar. 11 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for applying quality of service to multi priority stream of data carried via a single transport layer connection.

A single transport layer connection between a remote display client and a server may be used for all communications. One remote display client is an ICA client. In ICA protocol the communication latency requirements may formulated in terms of virtual streams or channels which are assigned priorities. A high priority virtual channels may expect to have low communication latency. For example it may be desirable to maintain low latency for GUI interactions to improve human perceived responsiveness. To achieve this GUI interaction events may be sent in the high priority virtual channel while bulk data transfers file copy for example may be sent in the low priority channel.

The present solution addresses providing quality of service QoS to a transport layer connection given the different priorities of individual in flight packets within the connection. The ICA protocol enables QoS devices to extract priority information or tags from the network packets in order to send packets according to the stream s priority. Typically a single network packet contains payload only of one virtual channel for ICA. For a single connection carrying ICA out of order packet delivery based on virtual channel priority is desirable. As multiple virtual streams are time and space multiplexed into a single transport layer connection. Furthermore the transport layer connection of Transport Control Protocol TCP does not support out of order delivery. To make performing quality of service more challenging an attempt to reorder packets within single TCP stream may increase latency and wastes bandwidth due the retransmissions algorithm of TCP implementations. Typical TCP retransmission algorithms assume small normally constant reordering window and invokes fast retransmissions in case or packet reordering. With this ICA QoS may be performed on per connection basis such as by giving bandwidth preference to certain connections at the expense of the other connections.

One approach to per connection QoS for these type of protocols is to assign as the connection priority the maximum priority of all the buffered packets or protocol data units PDUs . For example in the case of a typical file copy to local drive or printing the corresponding connection will have a mix of bulk lower priority traffic and higher priority traffic due to user interface updates caused by user interface feedback such as progress reports and animations. Due to multiple channels multiplexing over the same connection assigning the maximum priority might not be optimal. The frequent user interface updates would effectively cause flushing of all buffered packets. This flushing may not produce any perceived improvement for the bulk transfer connection the progress bar and animation updates would still be queued behind the bulk traffic. On the other hand flushing may have less desirable and noticeable effect on the competing connections with interactive traffic. With this approach the performance may be reciprocal of the number of PDUs buffered. The more PDUs that are buffered e.g. waiting to be sent the less effective the approach may be. The buffering consideration can be more important with split connections maintained by intermediary devices such as WAN optimization applications. The amount of buffering in such applications is expected to be higher than in strictly QoS applications.

Another approach is to use an average of priorities of packets within the single connection such as the average of buffered packets waiting to be sent or in flight packets. In other words the solution may give more bandwidth to the connections that are on average mostly interactive at the expense of the connections that are on average are mostly bulk. In some aspects the average or mostly approach is useful. The solution may not try to improve bulk printing or file copy connection latency as it is not attainable with TCP in order delivery but instead to maintain acceptable latency for interactive connections. The averaging window can also be the same large or smaller than the number of buffered PDUs. Furthermore link utilization may be a factor to make averaging non linear or adaptive in view of link utilization of the connections.

In some aspects embodiments of the present solution may implement an averaging approach or policy using a number of various techniques. In some embodiments a straight average may be implemented such as via a boxcar FIR Finite Impulse Response type filter. A IIR Infinite Impulse Response filter may be employed to save space with a large window. In some embodiments the system does not store PDUs but just their priorities. For example with an embodiment of 8 different priorities a 3 bit state per PDU may be used. Furthermore any type of FIR and or IIR filters may be employed. For example in some embodiments hysteresis symmetric or asymmetric filtering may be used. In some embodiments a quick raise effect may be used while in some embodiments a long fall effect may be used. For example the system may quickly lower priority of the connection when encountering low priority PDU s and then slowly raise the priority of the connection based on time and number of PDUs with specific priorities.

In some embodiments PDUs may be replaced with bytes. Instead of sampling counting PDUs the system may sample and or count bytes in each virtual channel can be counted. Counting bytes instead of PDUs will make the algorithm agnostic to the differences in PDU sizes. In further embodiments the connection priorities can be translated into the standard TOC diff serve QoS bits packet marking to employ and work with other external QoS devices.

When employing standard QoS devices the reordering effects within the single connection may be considered when assigning different priority tags within the same TCP session. Typically standard QoS devices do not maintain per TCP connection state. Instead these standard QoS devices may assume that all packets within a single connection will have the same priority. To address this assumption one approach is to explicitly or implicitly rate limit connection priority changes. For example choosing large filter window would implicitly limit the rate. Another approach is to change the priority from low to high when there are no packets in flight.

In some aspects the present solution is directed to a method for providing quality of service QoS for a stream of protocol data units via a single transport layer connection. The method includes receiving by a device via a single transport layer connection a plurality of packets carrying a plurality of protocol data units. Each protocol data unit of the plurality of protocol data units identifying a priority.

The method also includes transmitting by the device via the single transport layer connection the plurality of packets carrying those protocol data units within the predetermined window of protocol data units while the connection priority of the single transport layer connection is assigned the average priority for the predetermined window of protocol data units.

Each protocol data unit may correspond to a virtual channel of the remote display protocol and the virtual channel may have or be assigned the priority via the remote display protocol. In some embodiments the method includes buffering by the device the plurality of packets until the connection priority for the plurality of packets is assigned to the transport layer connection.

The compression engine may first use the cache based data to determine one or more data matches for compression and then may check the memory based data to determine one or more data matches for compression. In another case the compression engine may check disk storage for data matches for compression after checking either the cache based and or memory based data history.

In one embodiment multi protocol compression engine compresses bi directionally between clients and servers any TCP IP based protocol including Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI email File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Common Internet File System CIFS protocol file transfer Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol Remote Desktop Protocol RDP Wireless Application Protocol WAP Mobile IP protocol and Voice Over IP VoIP protocol.

The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not over utilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. Unlike conventional network protocols such as TCP a receiver side flow control module controls the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer. The flow controller may implement a plurality of data flow control techniques at the transport layer including but not limited to 1 pre acknowledgements 2 window virtualization 3 recongestion techniques 3 local retransmission techniques 4 wavefront detection and disambiguation 5 transport control protocol selective acknowledgements 6 transaction boundary detection techniques and 7 repacketization.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a window size of four packet . This reduces the overhead by approximately a factor four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. In some embodiments this window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In the embodiment of TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header includes a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of or B initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet through put from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load it with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or its improved version Stabilized Vegas. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller. In another embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine includes the QoS engine for example separately but in communication with the flow controller . The QoS Engine includes any logic business rules function or operations for performing one or more Quality of Service QoS techniques improving the performance operation or quality of service of any of the network connections. In some embodiments the QoS engine includes network traffic control and management mechanisms that provide different priorities to different users applications data flows or connections. In other embodiments the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain level of performance to a user application data flow or connection. In one embodiment the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain portion of bandwidth or network capacity for a user application data flow or connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine monitors the achieved level of performance or the quality of service corresponding to a user application data flow or connection for example the data rate and delay. In response to monitoring the QoS engine dynamically controls or adjusts scheduling priorities of network packets to achieve the desired level of performance or quality of service.

In some embodiments the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more classes or levels of services.

The intermediary such as via the QoS or network optimization engine may receive and buffer a first set of packets as they are received perform priority filtering on such packets assign the connection priority to the connection and transmit those buffered packets via the connection while the connection priority determined based on those packets is applied or in effect for the connection. The intermediary such as via the QoS or network optimization engine may receive and buffer a next or subsequent set of packets as they are received perform priority filtering on such packets assign the connection priority to the connection and transmit those buffered packets of the next or subsequent set of packets via the connection while the connection priority determined based on those packets is applied or in effect for the connection. As such in some embodiments the intermediary may transmit those packets in which the connection priority is based on thru the connection with the connection is assigned the connection priority. For the example the intermediary may assign the connection priority for a window and transmit those packets in that window while the connection priority for that window is assigned to the connection.

The QoS engine may transmit packets from the intermediary based on the priorities assigned to each connection. For example the QoS Engine may first transmit one or more packets of a first connection with a connection priority higher than a second connection. The QoS engine may use any type and form of prioritization scheme to transmit packets from the intermediary based on the priorities assigned to each connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine sets the priority in the packets or PDUs to be transmitted. In some embodiments the intermediary transmits the packets to a QoS device to perform QoS for the connections using the connection based priority.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for connection based prioritization for connections carrying multiple priority data streams is depicted. In brief overview at step the intermediary identifies for each connection priorities of virtual channels PDUs or bytes received within the connection. At step the intermediary applies a filter to a count sample of PDU bytes. At step based on filtering the intermediary assigns a priority to connection. So although the PDUs or bytes within the connection have differing priorities the connection has a single priority based on filtering of these differing priorities. The intermediary may continue identifying and filtering PDU byte priorities to assign a priority for the connection. The intermediary may adjust a connection s priority based on link utilization and or rate control. At step the intermediary transmits PDUs bytes of the connections based on the priorities assigned to the connections.

At step the intermediary identifies priorities within connections received by or traversing the intermediary. The intermediary may receive and buffer packets for a connection for which the priorities are to be identified. The intermediary may receive and buffer PDUs data or bytes of a payload of a transport layer packet for a connection for which the priorities are to be identified. The intermediary may receive for each single transport layer connection a plurality of packets carrying a plurality of protocol data units. Each protocol data unit of the plurality of protocol data units may identify the same or different priority of another protocol data unit in the plurality of packets. In some embodiments the intermediary may receive for each single transport layer connection the plurality of packets carrying the plurality of protocol data units of a remote display protocol such as ICA or RDP. Each protocol data unit may identify or correspond to a virtual channel which may have a priority.

The intermediary may identify the priority of a virtual channel PDU or group of bytes from any header or field of any protocol at any layer of the network stack carried via the connection. The intermediary may identify the priority of a virtual channel PDU or group of bytes from any header or field of the protocol carrying the virtual channel PDU or group of bytes. The intermediary may identify the priority of a virtual channel PDU or group of bytes from any header or field of a protocol above the transport layer of the connection. The intermediary may identify the priority of a virtual channel PDU or group of bytes from the payload carried by the transport layer packet s of the connection.

The intermediary may identify priorities from each instance of a priority identified from a PDU. The intermediary may identify priorities from each instance of a priority identified within the data or byte stream. The intermediary may identify priorities within a predetermined window for each connection. The intermediary may sample priorities based on virtual channels PDUs or group of bytes. The intermediary may store the priorities to memory or storage element of the intermediary. The intermediary may store a group of priorities from a window. The intermediary may use a data structure array or object to hold in memory identified priorities. The intermediary may have a data structure array or object store or hold identified priorities on a connection by connection basis.

At step the intermediary applies a filter to a group or set of priorities for a connection. The filter of the intermediary may determine an average priority based on finite impulse response FIR filtering. The filter of the intermediary may determine an average priority based on infinite impulse response IIR filtering. The filter of the intermediary may specify configure or identify a predetermined window for filtering in terms of or as a predetermined number of protocol data units. The intermediary may determine an average priority for a predetermined window of protocol data units of the plurality of protocol data units received by the intermediary. The filter of the intermediary may specify configure or identify a predetermined window for filtering in terms of or as a predetermined time and or space conditions.

The intermediary applies a filter to a group or set of priorities each of the connections traversing or managed by the intermediary. The intermediary may apply the filter to generate calculate or provide a value for a priority for the connection based on the differing priorities of data traversing thru or carried by the connection. The intermediary may apply the filter to one or more windows of priorities. The intermediary may apply the filter to determine a type of average to a group of priorities such as a window of priorities. The intermediary may apply the filter to take a weighted average of a group of priorities such as a window of priorities. The intermediary may take as input to the filter other factors such as a link utilization and rate control policies in applying the filter to a group of priorities. The intermediary may apply the filter to determine a type of average of the priorities carried in a protocol or protocol layer above the transport layer of the connection.

At step the intermediary may assign a priority to a connection based on filtering. The intermediary may assign the average priority from the filter as a connection priority to the corresponding transport layer connection. The intermediary may assign an initial priority to a connection based on applying filtering to a first window of priorities received via the connection. The intermediary may reassign adjust or otherwise change the priority of the connection based on applying filtering to subsequent windows of priorities. The intermediary may adjust the priority for any one or more connections based on the intermediary s link utilization. The intermediary may adjust the priority for any one or more connections based on the connection s link utilization. The intermediary may continually identify priorities within a connection apply filtering to the priorities and adjust the priority of the connection. The intermediary may control the rate at which the priority of the connection is adjusted. In some embodiments although the filtering of priorities may produce a higher change in rate the intermediary may throttle or adjust the produced priority to a lower priority. In some embodiments although the filtering of priorities may produce a lower change in rate the intermediary may increase or adjust the produced priority to a higher priority. In some embodiments the intermediary may set the priority for the connection by setting any QoS bits or fields of the packets or PDUs to be transmitted such as ToS or Diffsery bits. As such in some embodiments the intermediary sets a Differentiated Services Code Point DSCP field in the plurality of packets each of these packets may correspond to the filtered window to correspond to the connection priority assigned to the transport layer connection. The intermediary may transmit one or more data packets with the connection priority identified via one of an internet protocol IP layer or transport layer and the one or more packets carrying a first protocol data unit having the priority identified via a protocol above the transport layer.

At step the intermediary may transmit packets PDUs or group of bytes of a connection based on the connection s currently assigned priority. The intermediary may transmit via the transport layer connection the plurality of packets carrying those protocol data units within the predetermined window of protocol data units while the connection priority of the transport layer connection is assigned the average priority for the predetermined window of protocol data units. The intermediary may transmit those packets buffered for the window in which the connection priority was determined upon setting the connection priority of the connection. The intermediary may transmit those packets buffered for the window in which the connection priority was determined while the connection priority of the connection is set to such a connection priority. The intermediary may buffer the next window of packets until the connection priority for the next window of packets is determined and assigned to the connection. Upon setting the connection priority of the connection for the next window the intermediary may transmit the buffered packets.

The intermediary may apply any quality of service scheme or algorithm among multiple connections for which the intermediary may assign priorities. The intermediary may take into account the current priority of each of the connections for transmitting packets PDUs or group of bytes via the intermediary. A higher priority connection may receive more transmission time and or transmission of a greater amount of data than a lower priority connection. In some embodiments the intermediary transmits packets PDUs or group of bytes. In accordance with any QoS setting of the packets PDUs or group of bytes which has been set based on the connection s priority. In some embodiments the intermediary transmits packets PDUs or group of bytes in accordance with a ToS or Diffsery setting has been set based on the connection s priority. In some embodiments the intermediary transmits packets PDUs or group of bytes with a QoS setting such as ToS or Differy setting based on the connection s priority to another QoS system or device for QoS processing and transmission.

Any of the above steps may be continually performed for a stream of packets received and processed by the intermediary device. For example the intermediary may identify a second next or subsequent average priority for a second next or subsequent predetermined window of protocol data units of a second next or subsequent plurality of protocol data units connection priority of the transport layer connection is assigned the second next or subsequent average priority for the second next or subsequent predetermined window of protocol data units.
