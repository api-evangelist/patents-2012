The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to contract number FA8611 08 C 2897 between the United States Air Force and United Technologies Corporation.

The present disclosure relates generally to flow feed systems of gas turbine engines and more particularly to a diffuser for such flow feed systems.

In order to cool parts sustaining extremely high temperatures systems providing cooling flow to the part may be utilized. For example in a gas turbine engine various parts of the combustor are exposed to hot combustion gases. Coolant may be supplied to these parts such as a combustor liner in order to cool the part and prevent degradation in engine performance or damage to engine parts that may occur from prolonged exposure to such hot gases.

However the coolant often impinges against the liners at an area directly under the coolant supply. This creates an unintended pressure drop in the coolant air flow. As a result the coolant may not be able to effectively cool the other areas of the liner due to the loss of pressure or momentum to provide coolant flow to these other areas of the liner.

Accordingly there exists a need for a diffuser that can reduce the pressure drop from the coolant supply to the impinged part and thus provide improved coolant flow to the parts experiencing sustained high temperatures.

According to one embodiment of the present disclosure a feed diffuser is disclosed. The diffuser may comprise a base disposed orthogonal to a flow a body extending from the base toward the flow and an apex provided at a termination of the body in a direction toward the flow. The body may decrease in cross sectional area from the base to the apex.

In a refinement a surface of the body may converge from the base to the apex and smoothly diffuse the flow.

In a related refinement the apex and a center of the base may be aligned with a central axis of the flow.

In another refinement the feed diffuser may further comprise a plurality of spacers extending from the base. The spacers may be configured to mount the base to an impingement sheet at a distance from the impingement sheet.

In a related refinement the flow may exit from a coolant supply tube situated within a pressure sheet. The pressure sheet and the impingement sheet may define a plenum.

In a related refinement the plenum may be a coolant air flow passage between a combustor shell and a combustor liner of a combustor of a gas turbine engine.

According to another embodiment a system for providing flow to a target sheet is disclosed. The system may comprise a coolant supply source configured to provide a flow in an orthogonal projection onto the target sheet and a diffuser having a body with a downstream end mounted on the target sheet and an upstream end facing the flow. The diffuser may increase in cross sectional area from the upstream end to the downstream end.

In a refinement the coolant supply source may be a compressor of a gas turbine engine and the target sheet may be a liner of a combustor of a gas turbine engine.

In yet another refinement the upstream end may comprise an apex and a surface of the body may diverge from the upstream end to the downstream end in an arcuate shape.

In a related refinement the surface may be concaved from the upstream end to the downstream end thereby smoothly distributing the flow to the target sheet.

According to yet another embodiment a combustor is disclosed. The combustor may comprise a shell having impingement holes a liner and at least one diffuser mounted on the liner directly under one of the impingement holes in the shell.

In another related refinement the liner may have holes and the at least one diffuser may have a plurality of spacers for preventing blockage of the holes in the liner.

In yet another refinement the at least one diffuser may decrease in cross sectional area from a base to an apex.

These and other aspects and features of the disclosure will become more readily apparent upon reading the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions certain illustrative embodiments thereof will be shown and described below in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intention to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications alternative constructions and equivalents along within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure an exemplary feed diffuser is shown. The diffuser may generally comprise a body having a base and an apex . Although other shapes are certainly possible the body may have a generally conical shape with the base being substantially circular or cylindrical and the apex comprising a point or spike. Decreasing in cross sectional area from the base to the apex the body has a surface that converges from the base to the apex in a generally arcuate or concave shape. The body also has a central axis A extending through the base and the apex .

A plurality of spacers may extend from the base . Each of the spacers may be configured to mount the diffuser to a liner with the base separated at a distance from the liner . The sheet may have a plurality of holes through which air flow passes. By providing a distance between a surface of the liner and the base of the diffuser spacers prevent blockage of the holes and allow air to flow unobstructed through the holes . Although shown with spacers it will be understood that the diffuser may not have spacers as shown in without departing from the scope of this disclosure.

Turning now to the diffuser may be part of a system for providing flow to a target sheet or liner according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The system may also include a coolant supply source configured to provide a coolant flow indicated by arrow in an orthogonal direction onto the liner . The coolant supply source may comprise a coolant supply tube situated within a pressure sheet . The pressure sheet and the liner may define a plenum through which the flow is dispersed.

The diffuser may be positioned on the target sheet directly under the flow . More specifically the central axis A of the body may be aligned with a central axis of the flow coming from the coolant supply source . The base of the diffuser may be disposed orthogonal to the flow with the body extending from the base toward the flow . The apex may be upstream of the flow while the base may be downstream of the flow . The spacers of the diffuser may be mounted to a surface of the liner . The apex may be proximal to a feed of the coolant supply source . By placing the diffuser at a location where the flow from the feed of the coolant supply source directly impinges on the liner a curved surface of the body may smoothly diffuse and direct the flow in a radially outward direction as indicated by arrows thereby reducing a pressure drop of the flow throughout the plenum and conserving a momentum or pressure of the flow along the surface of the liner .

The diffuser of the present disclosure can be used on any number of different applications including but not limited to aerospace components such as gas turbine engines and airfoils. For example turning now to a sectional view of a gas turbine engine using a diffuser is shown in accordance with the teachings of this disclosure. The gas turbine engine may include a combustor which mixes and ignites pressurized air from a compressor with fuel from a fuel injector thereby generating hot combustion gases. A turbine downstream of the combustor extracts power from the hot combustion gases. The combustor may comprise an inner liner and an outer liner which collectively define a combustion chamber . An inner combustor shell and an outer combustor shell surround the liners and thereby define an air flow passage between the liner and the shell. An igniter may be provided through the outer combustor shell and outer liner to ignite the fuel and air mixture in the combustion chamber .

At least one diffuser may be mounted between the liners and the combustor shells to smoothly distribute cooling air flow throughout the air flow passage . For example as shown in the diffuser may be mounted by way of spacers to the outer liner . The spacers of the diffuser may provide a distance between a surface of the liner and the base of the diffuser to prevent blockage of effusion holes in the liner . The apex of the diffuser may be centered under an impingement hole in the outer combustor shell . The impingement hole of the shell may allow pressurized air from the compressor to enter the flow passage and impinge on the liner in order to cool the liner . The curved surface of the body of the diffuser may smoothly diffuse and direct an air flow coming from the impingement hole in a radially outward direction thereby reducing a pressure drop of the flow throughout the air flow passage and conserving a momentum of the flow along the surface of the liner .

Although the diffuser is shown as part of the combustor it will be understood that the diffuser may be utilized in other parts of a gas turbine engine such as including but not limited to in an augmentor between a nozzle and a sidewall. It will also be understood that the diffuser is not limited to gas turbine engines but may be used in any application to diffuse flow from a source. For example the diffuser may be used on an aircraft airfoil wing under a coolant supply configured to cool the wing of the aircraft.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the teachings of this disclosure can find industrial application in any number of different situations including but not limited to cooling systems. Such cooling systems may be used to provide coolant flow to parts sustaining high temperatures. For example such cooling systems may be utilized for cooling parts of land marine or aircraft applications such as in gas turbine engines. Specific examples of applicability may include combustors combustor liners and combustor shells of a gas turbine engine.

The disclosure described provides an improved and efficient feed diffuser for cooling systems. By providing the disclosed diffuser at a feed of a coolant supply source the pressure of the coolant flow may be preserved. Prior cooling systems provided a flow that directly impinged on a target part resulting in a significant pressure drop or loss of momentum in the coolant flow. With such reduced coolant flow prior art parts may experience sustained heat exposure heat stress and potential cracking.

With the disclosed diffuser however the flow is smoothly guided along the curved surface of the diffuser greatly reducing the pressure drop of the coolant flow and conserving its momentum. Thus the diffuser has the ability to distribute a flow to larger areas of the target part thereby providing a more efficient cooling system using a minimal amount of coolant flow.

While the foregoing detailed description has been given and provided with respect to certain specific embodiments it is to be understood that the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to such embodiments but that the same are provided simply for enablement and best mode purposes. The breadth and spirit of the present disclosure is broader than the embodiments specifically disclosed and encompassed within the claims appended hereto.
