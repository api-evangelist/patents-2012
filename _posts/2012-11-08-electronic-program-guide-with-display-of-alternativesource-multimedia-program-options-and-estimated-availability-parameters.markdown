title: Electronic program guide with display of alternative-source multimedia program options and estimated availability parameters
abstract: An electronic program guide (“EPG”) coordinates the display of availability metadata representing the availability of listed multimedia programs from one or more alternative content sources. The EPG presents multimedia programs available from a primary content source. A system identifies alternative content sources for one or more multimedia programs listed in the EPG, estimates availability parameters from these alternative content sources, and supplements the EPG with availability metadata that represent the determined availability parameters of the versions of the multimedia programs from one or more alternative content sources. The system estimates missing availability parameters based on application of one or more availability rule sets, which can reflect, for example, a contractual agreement or arrangement, a data analysis performed on historical availability data for the multimedia program or the content provider, and the like.

The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 671 712 filed on an even date herewith.

The present disclosure is related generally to multimedia content services and more particularly to electronic program guides.

Traditionally television programs movies and other multimedia programs were delivered to users as linear television content that is television programs were delivered to the users through over the air television station broadcasts or through the communications networks of cable television providers and satellite television providers. The adaptation of the communications networks of cable television providers and satellite television providers to providing broadband Internet access and the advent of Internet based multimedia content sources often referred to as over the top OTT content sources have provided users with multiple potential alternative sources of a desired multimedia program. However as these alternative sources typically are controlled by separate entities and as many OTT content sources do not facilitate ready access to their schedules of available multimedia programs a user generally must separately reference each content provider s program guide in turn in order to identify the available options for viewing a desired multimedia program. Typically this presents too great of a burden on the user who often defaults to seeking the desired multimedia program via the program guide of a preferred content provider and who thereby misses out on potentially better options such as an alternative version having a higher display resolution or having a lower access cost for the multimedia program from a different content provider.

Turning to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements techniques of the present disclosure are illustrated as being implemented in a suitable environment. The following description is intended to convey a thorough understanding of the present disclosure by providing a number of specific embodiments and details involving user interaction with an electronic program guide. It is understood however that the present disclosure is not limited to these specific embodiments and details which are examples only and the scope of the disclosure is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims and equivalents thereof. It is further understood that one possessing ordinary skill in the art in light of known systems and methods would appreciate the use of the invention for its intended purposes and benefits in any number of alternative embodiments depending upon specific design and other needs.

The user equipment integrates or is coupleable to a display used to present the video content of a multimedia program selected by a user. The user equipment further can include a remote control device touchscreen keyboard button panel or other human machine interface to facilitate user input to control operation of the user equipment . The user equipment further may include a network interface device such as a cable modem a satellite modem a wireless access point or router that serves as the local network termination point for the communications network . The communications network can comprise any of a variety of communications networks or combination thereof such as a cable television distribution network a wide area network a cellular phone network the Internet and the like. In at least one embodiment the communications network provides the user equipment with Internet access or other wide area network access such as broadband Internet access supplied through the cable television distribution network of a cable television provider or broadband Internet access supplied to cellular data enabled devices by a cellular phone service provider. In other embodiments the user equipment includes a separate interface or connection not shown to the Internet or other wide area network.

The service provider network operates to provide the user equipment with multimedia programs via the communications network or via a separate interface to the Internet employed by the user equipment . The multimedia programs may originate from various content sources including one or more linear television content sources e.g. terrestrial television broadcast sources cable television sources or satellite television sources one or more video on demand VOD content sources or from one or more Internet based multimedia content sources referred to collectively as multimedia content sources through . The Internet based multimedia content sources are typically referred to in the art as over the top or OTT content sources in reference to the typical arrangement whereby the multimedia content provided by these sources is provided via the Internet connection afforded by the communications network of the service provider network but is not multimedia content sourced by the service provider network . Accordingly for ease of reference the Internet based multimedia content sources are referred to herein as OTT content sources . Current commercial examples of such OTT content sources include multimedia program subscription services multimedia program streaming services and multimedia program streaming and downloading services.

To facilitate a users selections of multimedia programs for display at the user equipment the service provider network also typically provides an EPG to each user equipment whereby the EPG primarily represents the current program lineup available from the primary or default content source of the service provider network . This primary content source typically is the linear television content source but instead may comprise a different content source such as one of the OTT content sources . For ease of description the linear television content source is assumed to be the primary content source for the example embodiments described herein. As such the OTT content sources and the VOD content sources are assumed to be the alternative content sources for the example embodiments described herein. However in other embodiments an OTT content source may comprise the primary content source and the linear television content source may be an alternative content source.

The EPG comprises a graphical user interface which presents various program related information i.e. program metadata to the user and with which the user may interact to initiate various actions. The EPG may be implemented as a web page based graphical user interface that is implemented via a hypertext markup language based structure or implemented as a custom graphical user interface integrated with the firmware or software executing at the user equipment and the like. The program metadata presented via the EPG can include a navigable display of the channels available from the primary content source a navigable display of the current program lineup of multimedia programs available from the primary content source and a display of program metadata associated with a multimedia program selected by the user from the current program lineup.

For linear television programming the navigable display of the current program lineup can include a time by channel grid or matrix whereby each channel is represented by a row and each time slot e.g. of a half hour duration is represented by a column and thus the primary source multimedia program available at a particular channel in a particular timeslot is represented by a program icon or program title at the intersection of the corresponding row and the corresponding column. To illustrate in the example of a multimedia program entitled Modern Family is broadcast on channel from 8 00 9 00 P.M. and thus is represented in the current program lineup grid by a program icon that extends across the two columns representing the 8 00 8 30 P.M. and the 8 30 9 00 P.M. time slots in the first row which corresponds to channel . As another example in the example of a multimedia program entitled The Office is broadcast on channel from 8 00 8 30 P.M. and thus is represented in the current program lineup matrix by a program icon that occupies the intersection of the column representing the 8 00 8 30 P.M. time slot with the row representing channel .

Unlike linear content sources multimedia programs provided by an OTT content source typically are not tied to particular time slots or to particular channels and thus in instances whereby an OTT content source is the primary content source associated with the EPG the navigable display of the current program lineup may present the available multimedia programs as for example a navigable list a navigable grid or matrix of icons with or without corresponding description a set of hierarchical windows or tabs that arrange multimedia programs by certain common characteristics e.g. genre common themes actors directors etc. and the like.

The program metadata displayed in the EPG for a selected multimedia program of the current program lineup can include for example general program metadata such as the name of the series if the selected multimedia program is an episode of the series the broadcaster or producer of the selected multimedia program the channel on which the selected multimedia program is available the scheduled start time and end time of the multimedia program and the like. The displayed program metadata further can include synopsis metadata that presents for example the title of the episode if the multimedia program is an episode of a series a synopsis of the multimedia program the actors appearing in the program the date of first airing and the like.

As noted above the user equipment may have access to versions of multimedia programs from a variety of content sources and thus multiple versions of certain multimedia programs may be available from more than one content source at any given time. A content source other than the primary content source associated with the EPG is referred to herein as an alternative content source. In many instances the user may prefer to access a version of a multimedia program from an alternative content source rather than the version available from the primary content source associated with the EPG for any of a variety of reasons. For example the multimedia program may be available at a higher resolution or accessible at a different price from an alternative content source. As another example the multimedia program may be available at a more desirable time or available on demand than the time that the multimedia program is scheduled to air by the primary content source.

Thus to facilitate the user s ability to select an alternative content source of a desired multimedia program the EPG further may present visual indicators of availability metadata representing available alternative source versions for a multimedia program represented in the display of the current program lineup of the primary content source. In the example of these visual indicators may be presented in the form of a navigable display of alternative source versions of a selected multimedia program whereby the availability of the multimedia program from an alternative content source may be indicated by a selectable icon or other field within the navigable display . To illustrate in response to the user selecting the program icon from the current program lineup to indicate a selection of an episode entitled Valentine s Day for the series entitled The Office the EPG may present via the navigable display selectable availability icons and referred to collectively as availability icons through each selectable availability icon representing one or more availability parameters for the version of the selected Valentine s Day episode available from a corresponding one of four OTT content sources. Each selectable availability icon through may have one or more visual characteristics that reflect various availability parameters for the version of the multimedia program from the corresponding OTT content source. For example when the multimedia program is available from an alternative content source the selectable icon associated with that alternative content source may have unbroken lines or exhibit a particular color to represent that a version of the multimedia program is available from the alternative content source. Conversely when the multimedia program is not available from an alternative content source the selectable icon associated with that alternative content source may have broken lines be shaded or exhibit a different color to represent that the multimedia program is not available from the alternative content source.

The selectable icons through further may present other availability metadata such as a dollar sign or other icon indicating there is a fee to access the multimedia program from the corresponding alternative content source an icon indicating a resolution or video quality of the version of the multimedia program available from the corresponding alternative content source e.g. the display of the one of the acronyms HD or SD to high definition or standard definition respectively a visual indicator that the multimedia program will soon be unavailable from the corresponding alternative content source and the like. In the event that there are multiple versions of the multimedia program available from the same alternative content source e.g. a standard definition version and a high definition version a selectable icon may be displayed for each version.

Availability metadata for the alternative content sources may not be expressly available from or expressly identified by the alternative content sources or other source and thus certain availability metadata such as the availability start date the availability end date the price or the quality may need to be estimated based on the application of one or more rule sets to input data based on the analysis of access patterns present in historical availability data or based on a combination thereof. Various techniques for estimating the availability metadata of alternative source versions of multimedia programs are described in greater detail below with reference to and .

A user s selection of one of the selectable availability icons through triggers the EPG to initiate the access and presentation of the selected multimedia program from the alternative content source associated with the selected icon. This process can include for example initiating the download or streaming of the data from a network location of the alternative content source initializing or configuring a separate application e.g. a web browser used to view the multimedia program from the alternative content source or directing the EPG or a separate web browser to a web page or other graphical user interface through which the user can login to the alternative content source arrange if necessary for payment for the price to access the multimedia program from the alternative content source and initiate downloading or presentation of the multimedia program.

Due to a variety of factors there is the potential for the program metadata displayed via the EPG to be inaccurate. Dynamic changes in the current program lineup such as when a sporting event or a presidential debate overruns its allotted time slot may cause changes to the start times and end times of multimedia programs of one or more channels or one or more content sources. Moreover as described in greater detail below certain availability metadata may not be expressly available or expressly identified by content sources and thus certain availability parameters such as the availability start date the availability end date the price or the quality may need to be estimated based on the application of a specified rule set derived from for example contractual arrangements among the involved parties or based on an analysis of historical availability data. As these availability parameters are estimates they may be inaccurate and thus in need of correction. In at least one embodiment the service provider network may leverage the user s ability to interact via the EPG to obtain user feedback identifying program metadata that are potentially incorrect or misleading. The service provider network then takes an appropriate action in response.

To this end the EPG may implement a selectable icon or other user navigable field to allow a user to initiate user feedback to identify inaccurate program metadata and in some embodiments to allow a user to submit user feedback in the form of an indicator of a proposed correction to potentially incorrect or misleading program metadata. This user feedback then may be used alone or in aggregation with feedback from other users for the same program metadata to initiate administrative review and correction of the identified program metadata or in the case of user proposed corrections to identified program metadata to automatically correct the identified program metadata based on the users proposed corrections. Example techniques for obtaining and implementing user feedback for potentially inaccurate program metadata of an EPG are described in greater detail below with reference to and .

To illustrate the program icon associated with a multimedia program entitled The Office can include an availability icon identifying the multimedia program having an version alternatively available from the Netflix OTT content source and an availability icon identifying the multimedia program as having a version alternatively available from the iTunes OTT content source. Moreover the program icons can include visual indicators to indicate various specific availability parameters for the alternative source versions of the multimedia program. For example the availability icon can include a sub icon depicting the acronym SD to reflect that this version of the multimedia program is a standard definition version and the availability icon can include a sub icon depicting a dollar sign and a sub icon depicting the acronym HD to reflect that this version of the multimedia program has an access prices and is available in high definition. As another example the program icon associated with the multimedia program entitled 30 Rock can include an availability icon identifying that the multimedia program is alternatively available from multiple alternative content sources. The availability icon thus can include for example a visual depiction of the phrase Multiple Alternatives. 

Other availability parameters may be visually depicted within the program icons using any of a variety of visual signifiers. As an example colors shading or certain border formats for the program icons may be used to convey alternative source options for multimedia programs displayed in the EPG . To illustrate the program icons displayed in the navigable display may have different background colors or different border colors based on whether the corresponding multimedia program has an alternative content source. Moreover program icons may have a particular shade of the color or a particular border feature e.g. thicker border lines to indicate the characteristics of the alternative content source. For example those multimedia programs available from a different content source may have a background color of green whereas multimedia programs without an alternative content source have a background color of blue and those multimedia programs having an alternative content source that sources the multimedia program for free or at a higher picture resolution may also have thicker border lines. As such a user can quickly ascertain at a glance the availability status of multimedia programs listed in the EPG . The user then may select the program icon for a multimedia program of interest to direct the EPG to display additional information for the multimedia program such as in the navigable display of described above. Other examples of such visual parameters that signal to the user that the multimedia program associated with the program icon is available from one or more alternative content sources or to signal that the availability of the multimedia program from alternative content sources will be ending soon include a flashing program icon or flashing border a stock ticker type scroll and the like.

The availability icons presented in the program icons may be selectable by the user whereby the EPG is configured to initiate various actions in response to selection of an availability icon. For example in response to the user s selection of the availability icon the EPG may open a web browser at the user equipment see and direct the web browser to a uniform resource link URL associated with the multimedia program at the Netflix website. As another example in response to the user s selection of the availability icon the EPG could display another GUI depicting the various options available for obtaining a version of the corresponding multimedia program from alternative content sources and facilitating a user s selection of one of the various options. An example of such a GUI is described below with reference to .

Moreover the EPG depicted in can employ a filter selection feature that enables the user to limit the displayed alternative source availability information to one or to a subset of dimensions or attributes. For example the user can limit the display of alternative source versions of the multimedia programs to only those of a certain resolution or display quality to only those that are free or are below a certain price to only those available from a specified subset of alternative content sources and the like. As such the filter selection feature can be used by the user to further simplify the user s choices based on criteria considered more important by the user.

Although various configurations of the EPG are described above with reference to the EPG is not limited to these example configurations but rather may be implemented in any of a variety of configurations that provide both a depiction of a multimedia program available from a primary content source via a current program lineup or other multimedia program list or matrix display and a depiction of the confirmed or estimated availability metadata for the alternative source versions of the multimedia program. To illustrate the EPG may implement a pop up window a picture in picture window or a hierarchy of user navigable windows to depict this information. As another example rather than display both the current program lineup from the primary content source and the availability metadata for alternative content sources on the same display screen the user equipment may integrate or be coupleable to a second display and the EPG may be spread over both displays such that the program metadata may be presented via the main display and the availability metadata may be presented via the second display. For example the user equipment may be implemented as a set top box coupleable to a television and coupleable to a remote control device with an integrated display and the EPG may be configured such that the current program lineup for the primary content source is depicted on the television and the availability metadata for alternative content sources is transmitted to the remote control device for display on the integrated display.

The depicted GUI can include a display of program metadata associated with a multimedia program selected by the user from the current program lineup whereby the depicted program metadata can include for example the general program metadata see such as the name of the series if the selected multimedia program is an episode of the series the broadcaster or producer of the selected multimedia program the channel on which the selected multimedia program is available and the scheduled start time and end time of the multimedia program as described above. The depicted program metadata also can include for example the synopsis metadata see that presents for example the title of the episode if the multimedia program is an episode of a series a synopsis of the multimedia program the actors appearing in the multimedia the date of first airing and the like.

The GUI further can include a user navigable display presenting the estimated or confirmed availability of alternative source versions of an identified multimedia program. This user navigable display can for example take the form of a table grid or matrix that lists various availability parameters for each alternative source version of the multimedia program. Such availability parameters can include for example the price to access the alternative version the quality of the alternative version the availability date range including one or both of an availability start date and an availability end date of the alternative version and the like. Further each alternative version of the multimedia program can include a selectable icon or other selectable GUI feature e.g. selectable icon that the user can select to initiate access to the corresponding alternative version. For example in response to the view selecting or otherwise manipulating the selectable icon the GUI initiates access to a webpage of the Netflix website that is associated with the version of the multimedia program available from the Netflix website.

As noted above information presented by the display of the program metadata or by the availability metadata may be inaccurate due to dynamic changes in the current program lineup errors in estimating availability parameters and the like. Accordingly the GUI can include user navigable features to facilitate user feedback identifying potentially erroneous depicted information. To illustrate the GUI can include a selectable icon for each alternative source version option presented in the user navigable display . When a user selects a selectable icon in the GUI the GUI initiates the display of a user feedback GUI that may be used to obtain the user s feedback on potentially inaccurate displayed information whereby such feedback can include for example flagging the information for review by an administrator or the feedback can include for example user proposed corrections to the displayed information. Techniques for obtaining this user feedback are described in greater detail below.

In the example of a GUI can be presented to the user in response to the user s selection of a multimedia program from for example the current program lineup displayed by the EPG . The GUI includes a display of the current program metadata for the selected multimedia program and a review icon that the user may select to flag or otherwise signal that the displayed program metadata may be erroneous and in need of administrative review and correction. For example a user may notice that the displayed multimedia program has a delayed start due to the previous multimedia program on the same channel having overrun its assigned time slot. In response the user may select the multimedia program and then select the review icon to indicate that the displayed program metadata is no longer accurate in that the start time needs to be shifted . In response to the user s selection of the review icon the EPG transmits a review flag indicator to the service provider network see . This review flag indicator then may be used to trigger review and correction of the program metadata by an administrator of the service provider network .

Further the availability of the multimedia program from an alternative content source may be estimated based on an analysis of historical availability data or from contractual arrangement information. As the availability in this case is an estimate there is potential for the multimedia program to be inaccurately represented as currently available from the subject alternative content source. Accordingly the GUI may include one or more user input fields by which the user can signal a need to correct the representation of the availability of the multimedia program. In the example of the GUI can include a user input field e.g. in the form of a radio button or a check box that the user can select to provide feedback that the identified multimedia program is to the user s knowledge not available from the alternative content source. In response to the user manipulating this field the EPG can submit a flag to the service provider network to indicate that the user has indicated that the multimedia program is not currently available in contrast to the current availability indicated by the presented availability metadata in the EPG .

In operation the metadata fetch and normalization agent fetches or otherwise obtains program metadata from the various content sources accessible via the service provider network . This program metadata can include for example EPG data for a linear television content source such as EPG data provided as a service by Tribune Media Services . The program metadata also can include for example OTT program lineup data and for OTT content sources denoted OTT1 OTT2 and OTT3 respectively. The OTT program lineup data may be obtained by the metadata fetch and normalization agent by for example scanning or analyzing the websites through which the OTT content sources provide multimedia programs or by accessing the data via a backend portal into the OTT content sources. For example Netflix provides an application programming interface API through which a software application may make API calls to obtain program metadata for the current lineup of multimedia programs available from the Netflix OTT service. The metadata fetch and normalization agent therefore may use this API to access the program metadata from the Netflix OTT service. Upon receipt of program metadata from a content source the metadata fetch and normalization agent normalizes the program metadata to a specified data format and stores the formatted program metadata in the program datastore .

The OTT analysis agent operates to match or correlate multimedia programs listed for the different content sources as versions of the same multimedia program. In order to do so the OTT analysis agent identifies each multimedia program listed in the current program lineup of the primary content source e.g. the linear television content source and then searches the program metadata of the alternative content sources using various search criteria to identify analogues of the identified multimedia program in the program metadata from the alternative content sources. This search can include external searches whereby the websites or other external interfaces provide by the alternative content sources are searched for matches. This search also may include internal searches of the program metadata represented in the program datastore . To illustrate upon identifying a multimedia program with a series title of Family Guy an episode title of Blue Harvest and a season identifier of season the correlation agent may search for multimedia programs with similar identifiers and determine a confidence score based on a degree of matching between the original identifiers and the identifiers associated with a multimedia program under analysis. In the event that the confidence score exceeds a threshold the correlation engine may update the program datastore to reflect that the multimedia program under analysis is the same multimedia program as that selected from the current program lineup and thus may be presented as an alternative source version option. The correlation engine further may access various program metadata and availability metadata from alternative content sources and populate the program datastore accordingly.

In certain instances certain availability parameters for a multimedia program from an alternative content source may not be explicitly defined or expressly available from the alternative content source or from a third party entity. To compensate the availability estimation agent operates in conjunction with the rules agent to estimate these missing availability parameters based on an analysis of various data such as contract data and historic data . The rules agent is programmed with various rule sets representing observed or expressed relationships between the availability parameters for multimedia programs from alternative content sources and certain events such as the airing of a multimedia program on a television broadcast channel the scheduling of a sporting event a priori knowledge of the typical delay between the occurrence of a sporting event and the availability of its recording from one or more OTT content sources and the like.

The contract data represent contractual arrangements between the alternative content source and a producer owner or other entity that controls the distribution of multimedia programs. These contractual arrangements thus may be represented by a set of rules that may be applied to a dataset to estimate when a multimedia program represented in the dataset will start to be available from the alternative content source will cease being available from the alternative content source the price to access the multimedia program from the alternative content source and the like. For example if the Hulu OTT service has an arrangement with the Fox Broadcasting Company that permits the Hulu OTT service to make episodes of the series The Simpsons available ten days after the episodes first air on the Fox television network for a fee of 2.99 and available for only three days duration then the rules agent can be programmed with a rule set that represents this ten day delay three day availability and cost arrangement. Accordingly when the availability estimation agent identifies an air date of July 1 for the next episode of The Simpsons the availability estimation agent may access the rule set from the rules agent and apply it to the July 1 air date to estimate that the next episode of The Simpsons would have an availability start date of July 11 an availability end date of July 13 and at a fee of 2.99.

The historic data represent an availability history of multimedia programs associated with or representative of the identified multimedia program. For example if the multimedia program is an episode in a series then the availability history represented by the historic data can include a history of the relationships between when previous episodes in the series first aired by a linear television content provider and when the previous episodes subsequently were available from alternative content sources the durations that the previous episodes were available or the prices set to access the previous episodes. By analyzing this availability history the availability estimation agent can develop a rule set used to determine estimated availability parameters in response to supplied input parameters. This rule set can reflect various metrics discernible from the availability history such as the average or median delay between the first air date and the availability start date at an alternative content source the average or median duration that the multimedia content is available at the alternative content source the average price set by the alternative content source and the like. The rule set further may be stored at the rules agent for future reference.

Table 1 below illustrates an example database schema and example data for episodes of a series entitled Glee to represent the availability history between the air date of the episodes by the content owner and the OTT content source.

From this example the delay between air date and availability date for this series is an average of 8 days a median of 8 days a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 9 days and the availability duration has an average of 173 days a median of 172 days a minimum of 172 days and a maximum of 174 days. As such the rules set could take a conservative approach and estimate that Episode 5 scheduled to air on Jan. 31 2012 would have an availability start date of 9 days later Feb. 9 2012 and availability end date of Jul. 30 2012 or 172 days following the availability start date. A more aggressive rule set may estimate that Episode 5 would have an availability start date of 8 days later Feb. 8 2012 and an availability end date of Jul. 30 2012 or 173 days following the availability start date.

For non episodic programs the availability history may be derived from previous airings of multimedia programs with one or more characteristics in common with the multimedia program at issue. For example if the contractual arrangement between a content owner and an OTT content provider are not available an estimate of the availability of a multimedia program may be determined from an availability history compiled for other multimedia programs owned by the same content owner and previously made available by the same OTT content provider. Other characteristics in common can include for example genre length actors directors producers similar titles resolution price etc.

In at least one embodiment the availability estimation agent utilizes a confidence level of the estimated availability parameters to decide whether to implement the estimated availability parameters as the availability metadata presented to the users via the EPG . If the confidence level is above a specified threshold then the estimated availability parameters are stored in the program datastore as the availability metadata for the multimedia program or the estimated availability parameters are provided to the user equipment for display in association with the EPG as described below. If the confidence level is below the specified threshold then the estimated availability parameters are discarded. The confidence level for the estimated availability parameters can be determined for example by a statistical analysis of the available history whereby a larger deviation in the mean or average availability delay or availability duration results in a lower confidence level and vice versa. As another example the confidence level may be determined from a comparison or cross referencing of the estimated availability parameters with the contract rules whereby the confidence level is modified based on the degree of similarity between the results of one or more existing contract rules and the estimated availability parameters. Moreover as described below an estimated availability parameter can be subsequently checked to determine whether it was accurate and the confidence level for the next round of estimation can be weighted accordingly.

The EPG service agent operates to access EPG data from the program datastore and to provide the accessed EPG data to the EPG display agent of the user equipment whereupon the EPG data are used by the EPG display agent to populate the data fields and display fields of the EPG displayed by the user equipment . The accessed EPG data include program data representative of the multimedia programs in the current program lineup of the primary content source. In conjunction with the provision of the EPG data the OTT analysis agent accesses the availability metadata associated with the multimedia programs of the current program lineup and provides the availability metadata to the overlay generation module of the user equipment . In one embodiment the overlay generation module generates an overlay for the displayed EPG to present the visual indicators of the availability of alternative source versions of the listed multimedia programs as described above with reference to the EPG of . In other embodiments the availability metadata are supplied to the EPG service agent which integrates the availability metadata into the EPG data supplied to the EPG display agent . A user then may use a remote control device or other input interface to interact with the displayed EPG whereby the user s interactions can include selecting a multimedia program from the current program lineup for presentation selecting an alternative source version of a multimedia program for presentation providing user feedback to correct potentially inaccurate program metadata and the like.

The feedback agent of the service provider network and the user feedback agent cooperate to facilitate user feedback on information presented in association with the EPG . As described above with reference to the EPG can provide one or more GUIs or user selectable icons or other features to allow a user to identify potentially inaccurate information displayed by the EPG either through a flag for review mechanism intended to spur an administrator to review the associated program metadata and correct as necessary or through a correction feedback mechanism whereby the user is solicited to propose the actual correction to the presented information such as by soliciting the user to provide a corrected start time a corrected end time or a corrected price in place of the information for these parameters which the user believes to be inaccurate. Accordingly when the user manipulates the EPG to provide such user feedback the user feedback agent forwards an indicator of the user feedback to the feedback agent of the service provider network . In response the feedback agent logs the user feedback indicators in a database or other datastore. In one embodiment the user feedback for a particular program metadata or a threshold number of instances of user feedback for a particular program metadata triggers the routing of an alert to a queue overseen by the administrator thereby initiating a review of the item of information by the administrator in turn. If the administrator deems the information to be inaccurate then the administrator can update the corresponding program metadata in the program datastore thereby addressing the issue. In embodiments whereby the users are enabled to propose actual corrections to the metadata a threshold number of consistent proposed corrections may be used to trigger an automatic correction to the metadata by the feedback agent that is without intervention on the part of the administrator thereby leveraging crowd sourcing capabilities to correct or update EPG metadata without the delay or complications of manual review and correction by the administrator .

The method initiates at block whereby the metadata fetch and normalization agent obtains current program lineup metadata for the linear television content source and stores the program lineup metadata in the program datastore . At block the metadata fetch and normalization agent obtains current program lineup metadata from one or more OTT content sources and stores the current program lineup metadata in the program datastore . At block the correlation agent identifies multimedia programs from the current program lineup of the linear television content and searches the program datastore and external sources to identify corresponding matching versions of the multimedia programs available from the OTT content sources.

At block the availability estimation agent and the rules agent determine the availability parameters of the matching multimedia programs from the OTT content sources. In some instances the availability parameters may be expressly identified in the program metadata obtained from the OTT content sources. However in other instances availability metadata may be missing or unavailable and in such instances the availability estimation agent and the rules agent apply one or more sets of rules to contract data and historic data to estimate the missing or unavailable availability parameters. An example method for the process of block is described below with reference to .

At block the OTT analysis agent updates the program datastore to reflect the identified matches between multimedia programs of the current program lineup and multimedia programs available from the OTT content sources as well as to update previously missing or inaccurate availability metadata for the multimedia programs available from the OTT content sources.

At block a user interfaces with the user equipment to initiate display of the EPG . In response at block the EPG service agent accesses EPG metadata from the program datastore and provides the EPG metadata to the EPG display agent for use in generating a user navigable EPG for display to the user. The EPG metadata include program metadata for a current program lineup for the linear television content provider which is displayed in a grid or matrix form in the EPG . Moreover as certain multimedia programs listed in the current program lineup may have alternative versions available from one or more OTT content sources the correlation agent provides alternative availability metadata to the overlay generation agent which generates an overlay for the EPG to present or depict visual indicators of these alternative sources of the listed multimedia programs. At block the EPG display agent provides the EPG with the overlay for display at the display coupled to the user equipment . The user then may navigate the EPG to select a multimedia program from the linear television content provider or an alternative version of the multimedia program from an OTT content source if available for presentation by the user equipment .

The method initiates at block whereby the availability estimation agent selects an unanalyzed multimedia program and determines one or more attributes of the selected multimedia program to be used in preparing an availability history for the multimedia program. The attributes of the selected multimedia program can include for example the title of the multimedia program the type or genre of the multimedia program e.g. sporting event television show movie comedy drama etc. the length of the multimedia program the owner or producer of the multimedia program the age or original air date of the multimedia program actors directors or producers associated with the multimedia program the resolution or video quality the price to access the multimedia program and the like. If the multimedia program is an episode of a series then the attributes further can include a season number an episode number a series title and the like. At block the availability estimation module uses the identified attributes to identify similarly situated multimedia programs that have previously aired and to develop an availability history reflecting the air dates of these other multimedia programs and their subsequent availabilities at the OTT content source at issue. This availability history can be implemented as one or more tables or data structures arranged around a separate axis for each identified attribute. For example the availability history can include an availability history subset pertaining to other multimedia programs of the same genre an availability history subset pertaining to other multimedia programs from the same content owner and the like. The availability history may represent other availability patterns such as the prices charged for similar multimedia programs made available by the OTT content source.

At block the availability estimation module attempts to determine patterns in previous airings of related multimedia programs the subsequent dates that the related multimedia programs next became available from the OTT content source as well as a pattern in the duration that the related multimedia programs were available from the OTT content source. The estimated patterns instead may reflect for example a pattern in the prices charged for multimedia programs with similar attributes and made available from the OTT content source. This pattern estimation may be separately determined for each dimension of attributes for a different subsets of attributes and the like.

At block the availability estimation module estimates the availability parameters for the selected multimedia program based on an analysis of the one or more patterns discerned at block . In one embodiment the availability parameters may be estimated based on a weighted combination of the multiple patterns whereby patterns for attributes deemed to be more likely to reflect the actual availability pattern are weighted more heavily than patterns for attributes deemed to be less likely to reflect the actual availability pattern. For example an availability pattern determined based on previous episodes of the same series is likely to be more accurate than an availability pattern determined based on the availability history of other multimedia programs of the same length or having the same lead actor and thus these two different availability patterns are weighted accordingly. The availability parameters may be calculated by using the single best availability pattern e.g. the availability pattern determined from a history of previous episodes in the same series or as for example a weighted averaging of two or more availability patterns e.g. a weighted average of the average price for multimedia programs of the same genre as the selected multimedia program and the average price for multimedia programs owned by the same entity as the selected multimedia program .

As noted above there may be a contractual arrangement or other arrangement that may specify when multimedia programs with similar characteristics e.g. same content owner same OTT source same genre and the like are available with a corresponding OTT content source. Accordingly concurrent with the process of blocks and at block the availability estimation agent can utilize the rule set maintained at the rules agent to estimate a second source of availability parameters for the multimedia program based on an application of one or more of the contract rules from the rule set.

At block the availability estimation agent estimates a confidence level for the estimated availability parameters determined at block . This confidence level may be determined based on a statistical analysis of the deviations present in the one or more access patterns used to estimate the availability. Alternatively the confidence level may be at least partially based on a correlation in the availability patterns discerned from different availability histories for different program attributes. In yet another embodiment the confidence level may be initially set to a specified level and then adjusted up and down based on the estimation performance of the availability estimation agent for similar multimedia programs. In yet another embodiment the confidence level may be at least partially based on a correlation between estimated availability parameters derived via the process of blocks and and the second set of estimated availability parameters derived from the application of the contract rules via the process of block such that a higher degree of similarity between these two estimates results in a higher confidence level.

At block the availability estimation agent compares the confidence level with a confidence threshold. If the confidence level does not exceed the confidence threshold then at block the availability estimation agent discards the estimated availability parameters and either marks the multimedia program as unavailable from the OTT content source or marks the estimated availability parameters so that a disclaimer of the accuracy of the availability parameters is displayed by the EPG if availability metadata are presented for the multimedia program in association with the OTT content source. Otherwise if the confidence level exceeds the threshold then at block the availability estimation module sets the availability parameters of the multimedia program to the estimated availability parameters.

In some embodiments the availability estimation agent can employ a feedback loop to improve its ability to estimate the availability parameters of alternative source multimedia programs. To this end the availability estimation agent subsequently performs at block an analysis of its estimation capabilities by comparing one or more sets of the estimated availability parameters with the actual availability parameters that resulted to determine at block whether the estimated availability parameters were relatively accurate. If the estimated availability parameters were not relatively accurate then at block the availability estimation agent decreases the confidence level for the next round of estimated availability parameters by for example decreasing a confidence factor used to weight successive confidence levels . If the estimated availability parameters were relatively accurate then at block the availability estimation agent increases the confidence level for the next round of estimated availability parameters by for example increasing the confidence factor .

The method initiates at block whereby the EPG service agent provides EPG data to the EPG display agent which uses the EPG data to display the EPG at the user equipment . At block the user notes the display of program metadata that the user believes to be inaccurate and in response the user interfaces with the EPG to provide user feedback identifying or otherwise indicating the potentially incorrect program metadata. As noted above the EPG can provide one or more selectable features that present a GUI that the user may interface with to provide the user feedback which may entail flagging certain information for review or which may entail soliciting the user to provide a proposed correction to the identified program metadata.

At block the EPG display agent forwards the user feedback input to the user feedback agent which then formats and transmits an indicator of the user feedback to the service provider network . The service provider network then may initiate correction of the program metadata in response to for example a threshold number of user feedback indicators for the program metadata at issue or the user feedback may be queued for review and manual correction by the administrator .

The example method depicted by is directed to manual correction of program metadata responsive to user submitted review flags. At block the feedback agent receives an indicator from the user equipment indicating that the user has submitted using for example the GUI of a user initiated review flag for an item of information displayed via the EPG at the user equipment . In response at block the feedback agent increments a review flag count associated with either the multimedia program associated with the item of information or the item of information itself. At block the feedback agent compares the review flag count with a specified threshold. If the review flag count does not exceed the threshold then no further action is taken and the method returns to block to await the next user initiated review flag for the program metadata. Otherwise if the revise flag count exceeds the threshold then it is likely that the program metadata contain an error and thus at block the feedback agent notifies the administrator of the likely error in the program metadata by for example queuing a review action request for the administrator . In response at block the administrator reviews the program metadata and then interfaces with the feedback agent to provide input to revise or to correct the program metadata if necessary. The feedback agent updates the program datastore to reflect the revised program metadata. With the program metadata corrected at block the feedback agent resets the review flag to the initial count and then awaits the next user initiated review flag.

The example method depicted by is directed to facilitating either manual or automatic correction of program metadata based on proposed corrections submitted by one or more users. The method initiates at block whereby the feedback agent receives an indicator from the user equipment indicating that the user has submitted using for example the GUI of or the GUI of a user initiated proposed correction for an item of information displayed via the EPG at the user equipment . In response at block the feedback agent increments a correction count associated with the item of information. Because users may submit inconsistent proposed corrections to program metadata e.g. one user may propose shifting a start time of a multimedia program from 8 00 P.M. to 8 30 P.M. due to the previous multimedia program on the same channel running over its time slot whereas another user may propose shifting the start time to 9 00 P.M. in some embodiments there may be multiple correction counts for an item of information each correction count associated with a different proposed correction.

At block the feedback agent compares the correction count with a specified high threshold. If the correction count exceeds the threshold then the service provider network considers that a sufficient number of consistent user initiated corrections have been received to implement at block an automatic update or revision to the program metadata based on the proposed correction associated with the correction count. For example if the threshold is 50 users submitting consistent proposed corrections to a price to access a multimedia program from an OTT content source and if the feedback agent receives 51 user feedback submissions proposing to correct the listed price from 2.99 to 1.99 then the feedback agent can automatically update the price metadata to reflect the revised price of 1.99 without engaging with or requiring the intervention of the administrator . At block the feedback agent resets the correction count in view of the correction to the program metadata at block .

Returning to block if the correction count does not exceed the high threshold then at block the feedback agent determines whether the correction count exceeds a lower specified threshold. If not then the method returns to block to await the next user initiated correction feedback. Otherwise if the correction count exceeds the lower threshold then at block the feedback agent notifies the administrator of the likely error in the program metadata by for example queuing a review action request for the administrator . While waiting for the administrator to respond the method also in parallel returns to block to await the next correction count. In response to the review action request at block the administrator reviews the program metadata and then interfaces with the feedback agent to provide input to revise or correct the program metadata if necessary. The feedback agent updates the program datastore to reflect the revised program metadata. With the program metadata corrected at block the feedback agent resets the correction count to the initial count and then awaits the next user initiated correction feedback.
