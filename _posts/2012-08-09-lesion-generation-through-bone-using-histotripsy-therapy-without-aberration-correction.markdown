The present disclosure generally relates to providing therapy to tissue with ultrasound energy. More specifically the present disclosure describes damaging tissue with Histotripsy therapy in the presence of intervening tissue or bones.

The effects of acoustic obstruction from rib and other bones have long been a challenge to researchers in high intensity focused ultrasound HIFU . In several non invasive surgery applications such as treatment for liver and pancreatic cancer it is often the case that the available acoustic windows are partially blocked by the ribs which can substantially decrease the ultrasound energy delivery to the focal target and may overheat overlying tissues due to the highly absorptive nature of bones. Furthermore ribs can cause significant field aberration by introducing secondary lobes in the focal profile which can result in undesired collateral damage.

To overcome these issues significant efforts have been dedicated to develop aberration correction algorithms in order to spare the ribs and improve beam forming. Theoretical studies on the application of virtual phased arrays to sonicate between the rib bones have been conducted a physically segmented transducer design was also proposed to prevent sonication to the ribs by aligning active elements with the intercostal gaps. More recently adaptive focal optimization algorithms for transcostal therapy have been developed depending on the presence of a point source or an identifiable acoustic spot at the desired focus. More sophisticated non invasive approaches using ultrasound scanning and time reversal to identify the ribs require transducers with transmit and receive capabilities. Other non invasive methods explored involve the use of CT or MRI to image the rib obstructions and selectively deactivate elements shadowed by the rib bones.

A major challenge facing trans thoracic ablation using ultrasound is to overcome the rib obstruction. For example skin burns and subcostal edema have been reported in clinical HIFU liver ablation cases. For transthoracic ablation of the liver using HIFU ribs in the ultrasound pathway cause periodic blockage of ultrasound resulting in a significantly decreased main lobe and increased grating lobes. Moreover due to the high ultrasound absorption coefficient of bone and reflection effects at the bone tissue interface overheating of ribs and surrounding tissue often results in unwanted tissue damage. Phased arrays and aberration correction algorithms have been developed to switch off the elements blocked by the ribs to reduce overheating to the ribs and associated tissue. Even with these improvements grating lobes may still remain producing undesired heating and collateral damage.

Similarly to trans thoracic ultrasound ablation transcranial ultrasound therapy is also very challenging as the highly aberrating and attenuating effects introduced by the skull can severely distort the therapeutic focus and limit the effectiveness of the treatment. To counter those issues HIFU systems use non invasive CT or MR imaging technology to correct for the acoustic aberration effects from the skull refs or other sophisticated correction algorithms such as combination of time reversal method and bubble signature ref . One of the main challenges in thermal HIFU for transcranial therapy is the need to avoid undesired skull overheating effects which limit the amount of ultrasound power that can be applied through the skull even when active cooling is performed on the scalp potentially reducing the effectiveness of the treatment.

The use of aberration correction algorithms has made it possible to perform noninvasive ultrasound therapy through bone obstruction. However the difficulties in implementing these correction algorithms is the need for phased arrays and the added complexity of the associated electronics imaging equipment and computation. Furthermore when bone obstacles are involved secondary lobes may still be present in the focal profile even after correction algorithms are applied due to the periodic ultrasound blockage pattern caused by the bones. Even though a lesion may be generated without overheating the overlying bones using the correction algorithms the treatment precision could still be poor due to the collateral damage resulted from the increased secondary lobes.

This disclosure describes using a specific form of pulsed therapeutic ultrasound or Histotripsy to non invasively generate lesions through ribs or other intervening bone structures. Histotripsy therapy mechanically ablates tissue through the initiation and maintenance of a cavitation bubble cloud which occurs when the focal pressure is above a certain threshold. Histotripsy can be configured to generate precise lesions through the ribs without aberration correction as long as the main beam retains its shape and is above the cavitation cloud initiation threshold while secondary lobes are below the threshold.

In some embodiments spherically focused transducers are used to generate lesions in tissue or tissue mimicking phantoms with bone aberrators placed between the transducer and its focus. A high speed camera or ultrasound imaging can be used to observe bubble cloud formation and lesion development in the tissue. Despite the high secondary lobes introduced by the bone aberrators the therapy can be controlled so that single histotripsy bubble clouds of similar shape develop exclusively at the focus resulting in well confined focal lesions with comparable dimensions. Collateral damage due to secondary lobes can therefore be limited and may comprise only marginal damage spots caused by single bubbles that fail to form a bubble cloud. Histotripsy therapy has a relatively high tolerance against aberrated fields and can generate confined focal lesions through rib obstacles without aberration correction.

This disclosure describes the use of Histotripsy therapy to generate lesions through rib or bone aberrators without applying any correction mechanisms other than transducer power modulation to compensate for attenuation effects. Histotripsy uses controlled cavitation bubble clouds to induce mechanical tissue fractionation. Histotripsy bubble clouds can be produced by delivering Histotripsy energy to tissue with a Histotripsy transducer defined by using short 10 MPa shockwave ultrasound pulses at a low duty cycle typically 

The tissue fractionation effect from Histotripsy therapy occurs when the focal pressure exceeds a certain threshold level at which a cavitation bubble cloud is initiated. Based on this threshold mechanism Histotripsy therapy can be controlled to generate precise lesions through the ribs or bone provided that the pressure main beam maintains its shape and is above the bubble cloud initiation threshold while secondary lobes resulting from the bone aberator remain below the threshold and thus do not initiate a cavitation bubble cloud.

The histotripsy transducer can comprise any transducer capable of producing histotripsy bubble clouds. More specifically the transducer can be configured to produce a histotripsy bubble cloud by delivering ultrasonic energy using short 10 MPa shockwave ultrasound pulses at a low duty cycle typically 

Generator is configured to deliver the ultrasound pulses to transducer via controller . Imaging system is configured to monitor the histotripsy therapy from transducer and can comprise any medical imaging system preferably B mode ultrasound imaging a high speed camera or a combination of the two. Bone aberrator can comprise any bone found in the human body and positioned between the transducer and the target tissue such as a rib skull or pelvic bone. The target tissue can comprise for example the heart the liver the brain the pancreas the prostate or any other tissue or organ positioned under bone.

Lesions in the target tissue can be created through the bone aberrators by driving the transducer with the RF generator and controller in such a way that the peak rarefactional pressure at the focus was equivalent to that applied in treatments without an intervening bone aberrator. In some embodiments treatment pulses can be applied at a pulse repetition frequency PRF of 100 Hz and 5 cycles per pulse.

The cavitation threshold and main beam vs. secondary lobes technique can be applied during Histotripsy therapy to ensure only the formation of a cavitational bubble cloud at a focal point of the Histotripsy transducer such as the transducer and Histotripsy system described above in .

Referring to in one embodiment tissue can be treated with Histotripsy transducer by first positioning focus of the transducer on the target tissue delivering Histotripy energy from the transducer through bone aberrator into the tissue forming a Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud on the tissue at the focus and preventing formation of secondary histotripsy bubble clouds without implementing an aberration correction algorithm.

In another embodiment tissue can be treated with Histotripsy transducer by first positioning focus of the transducer on the target tissue delivering Histotripy energy from the transducer through bone aberrator into the tissue and increasing a power level of the histotripsy transducer until a histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud develops at the focus on the tissue.

In yet another embodiment tissue can be treated with Histotripsy transducer by first positioning focus of the transducer on the target tissue delivering Histotripy energy from the transducer through bone aberrator into the tissue forming a Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud at the focus on the tissue observing formation of at least one secondary Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud positioned away from the focus and decreasing a power level of the Histotripsy transducer to eliminate the at least one secondary Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud.

In yet another embodiment tissue can be treated with Histotripsy transducer by first positioning focus of the transducer on the target tissue delivering Histotripy energy from the transducer through bone aberrator into the tissue forming a Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud at the focus on the tissue forming at least one secondary Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud positioned away from the focus and decreasing a power level of the Histotripsy transducer to eliminate the at least one secondary Histotripsy cavitational bubble cloud.

Histotripsy therapy is more resistant to the grating lobes caused by rib or other bone aberration as the cavitation cloud is only generated when the pressure exceeds a distinct threshold. By using an appropriate pressure where the main lobe is above the threshold while the grating lobes are not a confined cloud within the main lobe and a precise lesion can be produced despite the intervening ribs. Thermal damage to the overlying and surrounding tissue can be prevented by using a prolonged cooling time between pulses.

Lesion sizes and collateral damage distribution can be assessed with the aid of an image analysis script which allows image binarization into fractionated and intact areas with fractionated areas defined as zones with pixel intensities three standard deviations higher than the chosen background typically the space averaged intensity of pixels from a sample area on the intact blood layer. Once the image is binarized lesion dimensions are then estimated by a pixel count. illustrates A Sample picture of a treated tissue showing a translucent lesion. B Processed image sample for lesion size and collateral damage assessment. Collateral damage appears as small damage spots surrounding the main lesion area.

Without applying power compensation the presence of bone aberrators can substantially reduce the peak rarefactional pressure amplitude at the focus. Pressure insertion losses can vary depending on the type of aberrators.

In one experiment high levels of secondary grating lobes were introduced in the focal profile along the transversal axis perpendicular to the orientation of the rib aberrators. No significant secondary lobe development was observed in the transversal axis parallel to the orientation of the obstacles or along the longitudinal axis of propagation. The highest secondary lobes were in the range of 7 dB to 4 dB normalized to their respective main lobes 7 dB with porcine ribs and 4 dB with the rib phantom positioned at 4 cm from the focus See . The location of the secondary lobes varied from 5 8 mm with respect to the center of the main beam developing closer to the center when the rib obstacles were placed farther away from the transducer closer to the focus .

In practice the main beam does not undergo any noticeable shift in the transversal or longitudinal coordinates in the presence of a rib aberrator in the field. Despite the presence of high secondary lobes the main beam can remain relatively undistorted in all cases. Because of the significant insertion losses measured in the presence of the bone aberrators the transducer power can be appropriately increased to compensate for the attenuation and approximately equalize peak rarefactional pressure levels at the focus. In some embodiments the peak rarefactional pressure levels at the focus can be within the range of 13 15 MPa See .

Cavitation bubble clouds of comparable sizes can be successfully developed at the focus with and without the bone aberrators. In the initial stages of the treatment large bubbles can form at the main beam location within the first few pulses. These cavitation bubbles can eventually form a larger cigar shaped bubble cloud at the location of the main beam as a larger region of the target tissue is fractionated. Examples are shown in .

In the presence of the bone obstacles small cavitation nuclei can also be observed near locations where the secondary lobes were the highest. In some embodiments no bubbles will be generated in the secondary lobes when using 1 2 cycle pulses. However as treatment progresses these marginal bubbles do not become part of a cloud and will be pushed away by radiation force eventually collapsing on their own within the first 1000 to 2000 pulses of therapy.

In experimentation lesions were successfully created at the focus of the transducer in all cases. A total of 87 lesions were created in tissue phantoms 22 reference lesions were generated under free field conditions 45 lesions were created through the polycarbonate rib phantom and 20 lesions through the porcine ribs. Morphology of the transversal plane from several representative lesions is shown in . A circular main lesion was observed in all treatment cases A D with collateral damage occurring in the form of a few sporadic points within a ring shaped zone around the main lesion area. In treatments through the bone aberrators minor damage spots were observed at the locations where the secondary lobes were the highest but no significant fractionation areas were observed outside the main lesion.

Longitudinal plane lesions were generated along the plane where secondary lobes were observed i.e. perpendicular to the orientation of the rib obstacles . A cigar shaped main lesion was created in all treatments with incompletely fractionated areas in the form of thin damage streaks at the tail of the main lesion See . Lesions generated through the bone aberrators also displayed damage streaks on both sides of the main lesion consistent with locations where the temporary marginal nuclei were observed during imaging. But as with the transversal plane treatments no significant lesion development occurred outside the main beam region.

In a more quantitative point of view focal lesion areas generated through the rib aberrators were comparable to within a standard deviation of the lesion areas created in free field although the mean lesion sizes generated through the aberrators were slightly smaller See . Considering mean lesion dimensions in both transversal and longitudinal planes the largest lesions were generated in free field conditions while the smallest lesions were obtained through the porcine ribs.

In experiments the collateral damage created through the porcine ribs was minimal and not statistically significant in comparison to that observed in free field lesions Transversal N 10 p value 0.92 Longitudinal N 10 p value 0.7 . Higher amount of collateral damage from marginal bubble nuclei was observed in lesions created through the rib phantom particularly when the phantom was placed closer to the focus 4 cm .

In actual treatment scenarios a region larger than a single focal size should be ablated. In some embodiments lesions comprising of multiple focal spots separated from one another can be created to generate composite lesions through the bone aberrators. As with the single focus treatments comparable fractionated areas can be created in all cases resulting lesion development is well confined and limited to the focal zone while collateral damage from secondary lobes consisted of thin streaks caused by the translation of marginal bubble nuclei.

Bone aberrators can significantly distort the focal profile primarily in the form of increased secondary lobes at the expense of a reduced main beam in comparison to free field measurements i.e. no intervening bone aberrators . In the case of ribs the formation of secondary lobes is primarily a consequence of the distribution of the solid bone obstacles of the ribs which together act as an acoustic mask effectively creating an aperture with active elements radiating from the transcostal gaps between the solid obstacles. While the relative location of these secondary lobes in this case grating lobes may change depending on the spatial pattern of blockage caused by the distribution of the rib bones the shape of the main beam remains the same with and without the presence of rib obstacles. The shape and half maximum width of the main beam are not appreciably changed with the introduction of the rib aberrators. In the presence of skull in the ultrasound pathway the shape and position of the main beam may change.

Histotripsy therapy can be used to generate precise lesions through the ribs or other bone aberrators as long as the focal pressure main beam is above the cavitation cloud initiation threshold while secondary lobes are below the threshold. Supporting this premise cavitation bubble clouds of similar sizes were generated through the ribs and despite the high secondary lobes introduced by the rib aberrators the formation of a full bubble cloud was limited to the main beam which was also the only location where a lesion successfully developed. Temporary cavitation bubbles were observed to form at the locations of secondary lobes during the initial stages of treatment through the rib aberrators but these bubbles did not form a cloud eventually collapsing on their own pushed away by radiation force. This is evidenced by the collateral damage patterns observed in the phantoms which comprised of peripheral spots or streaks not comparable to the central main lesion.

In clinical applications requiring a larger volume to be ablated lesions with multiple foci can be generated by mechanically sweeping the focus of the transducer or by electronic focal steering if a phase array is used. As ablated regions increase in size collateral damage caused by secondary lobes would become even less relevant relative to the total size of the lesion.

In the experiment although the main lesion dimensions generated with and without the rib aberrators were comparable when accounting standard deviation ranges the mean area of lesions obtained through the rib aberrators was smaller relative to free field lesions. It should be pointed out that while all lesions were generated at similar focal peak rarefactional pressure levels 13 15 MPa peak compressional pressures were observed to vary more significantly with measurements differing by as much as 10 MPa in comparison to free field.

While cavitation threshold pressures cannot be measured in vivo histotripsy therapy at or near bubble cloud threshold levels is still feasible since cavitation bubble clouds can be readily monitored using conventional ultrasound imagers allowing the operator to be aware of when and where the threshold has been reached anywhere within a given region of interest. In an in vivo scenario the operator would start the treatment from low acoustic power settings and gradually increase power levels until a cavitation bubble cloud is imaged at the focal spot. Once a bubble cloud is created at the focus treatment could then proceed at that power level confining the bubble cloud to the location of the main beam and preventing secondary lobes from reaching the cavitation threshold. In the event that secondary lobes do reach the cavitation threshold the operator can reduce the power levels under ultrasound imaging until only the bubble cloud at the focus remains.

In addition because cavitation bubble clouds can be initiated at arbitrarily low duty cycles even single pulses as long as enough pressure is available at the focus the likelihood of inducing thermal effects in overlying tissues can be drastically reduced with the pulsed ultrasound regime used in histotripsy therapy. In this study for example the effective sonication duty cycle applied to achieve a bubble cloud was less than 0.07 in all treatments which is a negligible value in terms of HIFU therapy standards. This could allow transcostal therapy to be performed using simple single element transducers with a significantly better tolerance against bone overheating effects without necessarily requiring phased array designs in order to sonicate between intercostal spaces.

The rib or bone aberrators can significantly attenuate the peak focal pressure and introduce high secondary lobes in the focal profile. Treatment can be conducted by adjusting the input voltage of the transducer such that the peak rarefactional pressures are at similar levels to free field conditions. Despite the significant secondary lobes cavitation bubble clouds can be generated at the main beam locations resulting in lesions comparable in size to those created under free field conditions. Collateral damage from secondary lobes can be limited to damage spots caused by temporary cavitation bubbles that fail to coalesce into a cloud.

The threshold nature of the bubble cloud initiation in histotripsy therapy appears to confer it a good amount of robustness in the presence of high secondary lobes introduced by rib or bone aberrators. This characteristic coupled with the non thermal nature of the treatment suggest that histotripsy therapy is a useful non invasive tissue ablation modality for transcostal surgical applications such as treatment for hepatic and pancreatic cancer.
