title: Vacuum cup for delivery of agents during vacuum treatment
abstract: In various embodiments of the invention, the components can include a hemostatic vacuum cup which can utilize ancillary or self-contained vacuum generation, and a therapeutic agent which is supplied prior, simultaneously or subsequent to the application of a vacuum with the ultimate aim of slowing or arresting the flow of blood in a bodily tissue or organ. The invention relates to a hemostatic vacuum cup which can utilize ancillary or self-contained vacuum generation. The cup produces a hemostatic effect by the physical application of the device upon a traumatized tissue site and through the delivery of an agent, such as one that assists in hemostasis, antinociception, coagulation, sterilization, or other effective wound healing agents including antibiotics, antiseptics and antioxidants. The cup can be adapted to deliver the therapeutic agent, by methods integral to the vacuum cup. The therapeutic agent can be delivered in the form of a sponge, cellulose or other filter material.

This invention relates to the delivery of agents during the treatment of wounds or incisions wherein the agents are delivered via a vacuum cup attached to body parts and or tissue to reduce blood loss from the wounds or incisions.

Medicine is about saving lives and in this endeavor the cutting edge focus is on the actions and resources available to emergency responders in life threatening situations and first aid medics is war zones. In Iraq improvements in injury management including better designed tourniquets and hemostat bandages have significantly reduced fatalities. Rapid access to fresh whole blood and recombinant activated Factor VII also has reduced the likelihood that severely wounded combatants bled to death.

Bleeding or hemorrhaging is the loss of blood from the circulatory system. Bleeding can occur internally from blood vessels in organs inside the body. Alternatively bleeding can occur externally through a disruption of the vasculature which could be concealed resulting in a hematoma ore in the skin. Desanguination is a massive loss of blood from the body and results in acute blood loss anemia. The primary risk of desanguination is a reduction in the number of erythrocytes carrying hemoglobin and oxygen to the cells of the body. Typically 100 mL of blood transports approximately 20 mL of oxygen. Various organs extract the amount of oxygen they require for normal functioning from the blood circulating through the organ. For example the kidney brain and heart extract approximately 2 6.5 and 10.5 mL of oxygen per 100 mL of blood in circulation. When a person losses more than 20 of the total blood volume a lack of oxygen to the cells or hypoxia can occur. Hypoxia causes all blood vessels to dilate speeding up the blood flow. The venus blood return to the heart increases and as a result the heart works harder and faster trying to prevent cardiopulmonary congestion. Severe shock and lactic acidosis can result. Ultimately if blood loss exceeds 40 to 50 of plasma volume the resulting desanguination can lead to heart and circulatory failure and death. Initially the body compensates for a rapid reduction in oxygen supply by extracting liquids and electrolytes from tissues and interstitial spaces to expand the volume of plasma and formation of new blood cells. This decreases the viscosity of blood which increases the risks of cardiac dilation heart valve insufficiency and ventricular dysfunction. Severe bleeding can also reduce the amount of iron in the body to the extent that the bone marrow is unable to compensate for the loss of red blood cells. Bone marrow repletion of the blood supply takes significant time weeks which would not be relevant in an acute blood loss scenario likely to occur in a post traumatic setting.

In an embodiment of the present invention a therapeutic agent is administered via a vacuum cup where the vacuum cup is applied to a body part such that the therapeutic agent and the vacuum are used to reduce the hemorrhaging. The therapeutic agent applied through the vacuum cup can be advantageously used to apply a tamponade at a wound site rupture laceration or other bleeding site. By applying a mild vacuum to the site the target site is squeezed or compressed transmitting a mild pressure which slows or arrests bleeding. In an embodiment of the present invention by administering a therapeutic agent through the vacuum cup the therapeutic agent can allow a better vacuum to be applied to the wound site to allow the mild vacuum to function as a tamponade. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention by administering a therapeutic agent through the vacuum cup the therapeutic agent can function together with the mild vacuum to tamponade the hemorrhaging. This procedure can be utilized both internally and on external body surfaces as an advanced tamponade until the wound site can be otherwise repaired or treated.

In an embodiment of the present invention the therapeutic agent and the vacuum can be applied with heating of the surrounding tissue to vasodilate. In an embodiment of the present invention the therapeutic agent and the vacuum can be applied with cooling of the surrounding tissue to vasoconstrict. In an embodiment of the present invention the therapeutic agent and the vacuum can be applied with removal of heating of the surrounding tissue to vasoconstrict. In an embodiment of the present invention the therapeutic agent and the vacuum can be applied with removal of cooling of the surrounding tissue to vasodilate. In an embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying heating the healing process can be improved. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying cooling the healing process can be improved. In another embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying both heating and cooling to the surrounding tissue the healing process can be improved. In an embodiment of the present invention by alternatively applying heating and then cooling the healing process can be improved. In an embodiment of the present invention chemical agents can be used to one or both heat and cool the surrounding tissue. In an embodiment of the present invention physical processes can be used to one or both heat and cool the surrounding tissue.

In an embodiment of the present invention both positive and negative pressure can be applied within the cup to the surrounding tissue to improve the healing process.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention a transferasome agent that promotes trans epithelial absorption can be administered through the vacuum cup prior to or together with subcutaneous administration of an active agent. In an embodiment of the invention a transferasome agent that promotes trans epithelial absorption can be administered through the vacuum cup prior to or together with other therapeutic modalities. In an embodiment of the invention a transferasome agent can be used during therapy in cases where the would is closed. In an embodiment of the invention a transferasome agent can be used during therapy in cases where the would is a subcutaneous hematoma. In an embodiment of the invention the transferasome agent would be concentrated and delivered under the cup into the subcutaneous tissue where it would reach the vasculature and microvasculature and modulate the blood flow affect coagulation or deliver other therapeutic modalities. The purpose of the vacuum cup device is to compress and constrict the wound and deliver the drug or therapeutic agent in the region where tamponade is needed to augment or serve as a catalyst to the therapy.

Generally approximately in a low vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5 10torr to 5 10torr. Generally approximately in a medium vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5 10torr to 5 10torr. In an embodiment of the invention a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 10torr to 5 10torr. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 5 10torr to 10torr. The vacuum device can operate to lower the pressure from atmospheric pressure to generate a high vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention a low vacuum can be applied in for example obstetric suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention a medium vacuum can be applied in for example orthopedic suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention immediate release of a low vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.1 second and an upper limit of approximately 0.5 second. In an embodiment of the invention immediate release of a medium vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.3 second and an upper limit of approximately 1.0 second. In an embodiment of the invention a force of approximately 10Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum cup. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a force of approximately 10Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum cup.

The treatment of open wounds too large to spontaneously close have long been a troublesome area of medical practice. The initial stage of healing is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue which can take several hours. When an open wound is present or formed during surgery it is not feasible to wait for normal wound healing. In order to help address this situation application of vacuum has been proposed as a sealing device for the abnormal tissue. If a tissue displays a site which is bleeding a suction cup can be applied at that site to tamponade active bleeding until surgery can be used to repair or remove the structure in question. As shown in the vacuum cup can be at least partially transparent. In an alternative embodiment of the invention the vacuum cup contains material with a window to view the wound. In an embodiment of the invention if the trauma site or the peripheral margin of the wound is observed to have a bluish hue or dusky grey appearance to the tissue then it can be concluded that the appearance shows signs of ischemia and appropriate action can be taken including administering agents that will address the ischemia or lack of oxygenation to the cells.

When a vacuum is applied to a suction cup on a structure having a blood flow blood can typically pool inside the site which can lead to the formation of a hematoma. When an obstetrical vacuum extractor is applied to a fetal scalp during vacuum extraction assisted deliveries of newborns for example occasionally a small bruise or hematoma occurs on the scalp. Additionally some soft tissue edema and swelling can occur on the area of the scalp where the vacuum was applied.

There is a significant need for vacuum assisted devices for use by emergency responders first aid medics obstetricians and surgeons carrying out internal medical procedures. Some examples of vacuum assisted devices include vacuum cups grasping cups tamponade apparatuses and suction cups that attach to body tissues. The vacuum assisted devices can readily be applied in trauma situations where facilities are unavailable for full treatment of the wound. In an era when blood loss can necessitate transfusion and transfusion can introduce pathogens such as the AIDS and hepatitis virus to the recipient any strategy which can efficiently curtail or arrest blood loss as a temporizing method prior to or during surgery can add to the resources available to emergency responders in life threatening situations and first aid medics in war zones.

Before describing the invention in detail it is helpful to describe an example environment in which the invention can be implemented. The present invention is particularly useful for emergency responders or first aid medics where the procedure requires that a vacuum cup be attached to the body of a patient or a victim with a bleeding wound. When a first responder or first aid medic attempts to apply a vacuum to a bleeding wound to reduce the blood loss a number of difficulties are encountered. Firstly the surface of the wound to which the vacuum cup is to be applied is not sterile. Attempts to sterilize the wound can be confounded by the blood released by the wound. In addition the blood can clog or otherwise disrupt the ability of a prior art cup to form a vacuum seal. In various embodiments of the invention a vacuum cup with a dispensing seal can allow the emergency responder or first aid medic to dispense a therapeutic agent to increase the vacuum seal at the site of the wound in order to improve the vacuum applied to the wound. In various embodiments of the invention a vacuum cup with a dispensing sponge can allow the emergency responder or first aid medic to dispense a therapeutic agent at the site of the wound while the vacuum is applied to the wound. In various embodiments of the invention a vacuum cup able to dispense a therapeutic agent can also be used in existing surgical and obstetrical delivery procedures that require suction devices including vacuum cups grasping cups a tamponade apparatus or other fixtures that attach to body tissue. Each of these devices requires a vacuum to be applied to attach the suction device to tissue. The vacuum can be supplied by a pump.

In an embodiment of the invention the first responder might notice a closed wound with an expanding hematoma noticeable in the subcutaneous space. Several chemical moieties known as transferasomes can deliver drugs or agents via patches creams or biofilms that would penetrate under the site of application. The wound could be treated with this agent while simultaneously being covered and then constricted or compressed using the vacuum cup methodology.

As shown in the vacuum cup includes a top and base with a connecting side wall that defines a hollow interior cavity . As shown in the base is comprised of one or more annular rings which define the primary tissue contact area. In an embodiment of the invention within the hollow cavity one or more projected surfaces including provide one or more secondary tissue contact surfaces including . In an embodiment of the invention cavities within the vacuum cup including the projected surfaces the cup wall or the top can contain agents that can be released to the trauma site upon utilization of the vacuum cup . In an embodiment of the invention the design can apply the vacuum force supplied to or by the cup against the tissue site providing axial compression and radial constriction. The compressive action delivers the contained agent directly to the trauma site.

In an embodiment of the invention the primary purpose of applying the vacuum cup is to arrest the flow of blood to enable one or more of the first responders to undertake emergency stabilization procedures. In an alternative embodiment of the invention the primary purpose of applying the cup is to arrest the flow of blood while triage is undertaken to determine the priority of treatment for a number of patients. A secondary purpose of applying the vacuum cup is to replace traditional bandages or compresses used with an actively bleeding wound. Often in emergency situations medical personnel are a scarce resource and a conscious patient can be asked to hold a compression bandage on a bleeding wound. If the patient looses consciousness then the necessary compression is not supplied and significant blood loss can result. In this embodiment of the invention the vacuum cup acts as a method to reliably reduce bleeding while not otherwise requiring personnel to attend or monitor the stabilization of the wound. A tertiary purpose of applying the vacuum cup is to provide an integral drug delivery haemostatic treatment that simplifies the process of dressing treating and or resolving a trauma site. A quaternary purpose of applying the vacuum cup is to provide a disposable haemostatic vacuum cup that can be inexpensively produced and stored for a long term. In this embodiment of the invention emergency responders can routinely carry a vacuum cup that is hermetically sealed and can be removed from the hermetically sealed package and used when required. A quinary purpose of applying the vacuum cup is to provide a haemostatic vacuum cup that is easy to use and can utilize existing vacuum pump devices. The vacuum cup can be applied to provide one or more of the primary through quinary purposes.

In an embodiment of the invention the hollow cavity within the cup wall provides at least one projection perpendicular to the top of the cup . The projections can be arranged as concentric rings or cylinders with annular distal bases. The base and projection surface can be comprised of flat angular concave convex or ridged annular edges to provide an effective seal when in contact with the affected tissue. The cup and the projection are provided in varying sizes and shapes in a kit to meet the needs of differing trauma sites and tissues types . In an alternative embodiment of the invention a one size fits all vacuum cup can be utilized. As shown in upon application of vacuum to the cup the side walls deform in a controlled collapse that applies inward radial pull on the tissue in contact with the cup s primary annular base . The contact surface of the base is initially fixed at an acute angle with respect to the perpendicular of the affected tissue surface . Upon application of vacuum pressure to the cup the deformation of the side wall rotates the annular base bringing to bear the full surface area of the base against the affected tissue to create an effective seal. The collapse of the cup wall draws the tissue against the interior projection which effectively applies axial pressure to the trauma site. In an embodiment of the invention as shown in the distal surface of the projection includes a cavity that can contain the agent to be delivered. In an embodiment of the invention the delivered agent can be stored in the cup projection cavity in powder liquid gel or other forms. In an embodiment of the invention the delivered agent can be contained in an impregnated open cell foam pad gel biofilm cream impregnated polymer cloth or other absorbent medium within the cup including cavities and or . In an alternative embodiment of the invention the delivered agent can be supplied to tissue that contacts the projection surface when vacuum is applied to the cup . In another embodiment of the invention the delivered agent can be generally supplied to all tissue surfaces enclosed within the cup.

The vacuum is provided to one or more chambers within the cup by channels to insure vacuum supply to wall and projection cavities and or . The vacuum channels can be of diminished dimensions within the cup interior to insure proper primary wall collapse and secondary projection pressure. That is in an embodiment of the invention wall cavity vacuum channels can provide a greater vacuum for evacuation e.g. a greater vacuum in the volume of one or more cavities. In an embodiment of the invention the supply of vacuum pressure is to the top center of the cup to insure a unified and proportional evacuation of the chambers. The vacuum can also be supplied at different locations on the body of the cup with channels provided as required to the interior cavities and or . In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum pressure can be applied to the cup by an attachment port integral to the body of the cup . In an embodiment of the invention the location of the port is the top center of the cup . In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can also be supplied through a flexible tube that is integral to the cup. The cup vacuum port can contain a check valve not shown to insure the applied vacuum is maintained when applied from an external or integral source. The check valve can be constructed as an integral part of the cup or as a separate component bonded to or within the cup body.

In various embodiments of the invention the cup body components including the top side wall base and projections are made from a flexible elastomeric material such as silicone natural rubber nitrile neoprene or other thermoplastics. In various embodiments of the invention the cup material can have durometer hardness values between a lower limit of approximately 10 Shore 00 and an upper limit of approximately 50 Shore D. In an embodiment of the invention each cup body component has the same Shore values. In an alternative embodiment of the invention some cup body components have different Shore values. In another embodiment of the invention each cup body component has different Shore values.

In an embodiment of the invention the primary contact surface of the cup base can be covered with a sealing material as shown in comprised of a soft elastomeric material adhesive or other flexible compound to insure an effective seal. In an embodiment of the invention the covering material can be adhered to the base by means well known to a person skilled in the arts including sealants adhesives cements and natural glues or can be an integral part of the base .

In various embodiments of the invention the vacuum cup can allow grasping of tissue or the tissue surface of organs prior to or during various types of surgery. Any organ or structure that has a smooth surface to which a vacuum device can attach and manipulate can be a candidate for use with the vacuum cup . Further an organ or structure that has a rough surface can be addressed by adhering the covering material to the base . For example when a suction device is applied to a fetal scalp on which lanugo vellus or terminal hair is present the hair can disturb the seal between the suction device and the scalp and thereby result in a vacuum leak. Application of a covering material can allow a constant vacuum enabling traction extraction and manipulation of the fetal head.

In an embodiment of the invention as shown in the overhead schematic of a vacuum cup in the cup wall can be constructed with concentric ridges perpendicular to the base. The ridges can possess the same durometer characteristics as the wall or have differing Shore values. In an embodiment of the invention the cross section geometry of the ridges can be circular rectangular angular or a combination of geometries. In an embodiment of the invention the ridges can be constructed with equal or greater thickness compared to the non ridged areas of the cup wall .

In an embodiment of the invention as shown in the overhead schematic of a vacuum cup in the cup wall can be constructed with concentric areas or panes with respect to the base. These panes can possess the same durometer characteristics as the wall or have differing Shore values. The pane face geometry can be circular rectangular angular or a combination of geometries. The panes can be constructed with equal or greater thickness compared to the non paned areas of the cup wall .

In an embodiment of the invention the cup wall ridges and panes can be used to provide a controlled deformation of the cup when placed under vacuum pressure. In an embodiment of the invention the deformation can create the desired axial pressure and radial pull against the affected trauma site tissue .

In an embodiment of the invention as shown in the overhead schematic of a vacuum cup in the base can be constructed with concentric indentations or notches forming an annular pattern with respect to the cup wall . The notches can be of any geometric shape creating a contiguous contour of the base surface contact area. As shown in the overhead schematic of a vacuum cup in the cup overall shape can be of any geometry or size not shown including all aspects of the cup body components.

As shown in the side view of a vacuum cup in the cup can include a mechanical hand actuated integral vacuum generation device. In an embodiment of the present invention an integral bellows forms a part of the cup . In an embodiment of the invention the bellows can be constructed of a flexible material such as silicone natural rubber nitrile or other thermoplastics allowing repeated compression and expansion while maintaining air tight operation. The bellows includes an internal spring return component and an air exhaust valve . Upon user hand depression of the bellows both the body of the bellows and the spring are compressed. The exhaust valve provides for the one way escape of air within the bellows cavity when compressed. Release of the bellows by the user allows the spring to exert upward force against the bellows internal cavity creating an effective vacuum pressure. The bellows internal cavity can be internally connected to the vacuum port providing the direct supply of the generated vacuum pressure to the cup vacuum channels .

In an embodiment of the invention the hand actuation of the bellows can provide an effective downward force upon the cup essentially transforming the cup from a vacuum cup to a suction cup. This hand action will force the evacuation of the cup cavities and or initiating the haemostatic and active agent delivery actions. Release of the bellows allows the resultant vacuum pressure created to maintain internal cavity and or operational vacuum pressures. In an embodiment of the invention external vacuum generating devices can be connected to the exhaust valve to provide continued unattended vacuum pressure to the cup following the initial user hand activation of the bellows .

In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum cup can be applied and the vital signs of a patient can be monitored and the vacuum applied to the vacuum cup adjusted based on the patients vital signs. As outlined in the flow diagram in the vacuum cup is first applied . Next the vacuum device for applying a vacuum to the vacuum cup is connected . The vacuum device is then turned on or otherwise activated to apply a vacuum to the vacuum cup at . The vital signs of the patient are monitored initially and then monitored at regular intervals for signs of deterioration or other untoward signs . If the vital signs are within limits no adjustment of the vacuum is required. If the trauma site is still bleeding the vacuum can be increased . If the tissue is showing discoloration then the vacuum can be decreased .

A kit for use with the vacuum cup further comprises a material to one or both identify the wound and wipe blood away from the wound. A nociceptive can be incorporated as a therapeutic agent. A nociceptive such as Novocain which has vasoconstrictive activity can be incorporated into the material used to wipe the trauma site and into the vacuum cup base to reduce sensitization and bleeding in the periphery allowing an improved vacuum seal of the vacuum cup . After the wound site s are identified the integral suction and vacuum device is applied to the wound and activated to treat the wound and or to stop or minimize bleeding of a wound. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 196 196 and 5 112 608 to Scott et al. which are explicitly incorporated by reference in their entireties describe a pressure sensitive adhesive strip for adhering the dressing to a surface surrounding the wound and administering a therapeutic agent protease nexin I.

Application of the vacuum cup at a tissue site which is bleeding internally or externally to apply a constant vacuum i.e. an applied vacuum that compensates for the changed clotting behavior of the wound with time can allow enhanced clotting and cessation of the bleeding from the site. Application of the vacuum cup constricts the tissue at the margin of the trauma site into toward the site. As a result the margin collapses allowing pooling of blood and or clotting factors which aids in clotting and cessation of blood flow. The trauma site can be one or more of a subcutaneous hematoma an incision made by the surgeon a site of removal of tissue by the surgeon a site of removal of an organ made by the surgeon one or more puncture holes being treated by the surgeon or one or more laceration sites being treated by the surgeon. Treating the wound can include stopping the blood flow from a site reducing the blood from a site assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a site stopping the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma reducing the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma or assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a subcutaneous hematoma limiting its size and scope. Maintenance of the vacuum cup on the bleeding site will ultimately more actively collapse the wound. Accordingly the vacuum cup can be utilized as a tamponade for bleeding tissue. Under these circumstances a vacuum cup can be positioned over the trauma site and sufficient vacuum applied to squeeze the tissue surrounding the site and transmits pressure on the periphery of the site closing the aperture of the trauma to either slow or completely stop the bleeding.

In experiments with an animal model or simulations with human tissue it was observed that pop off detachments were significantly minimized with the vacuum cup . If traction force exceeds the pressure under the vacuum cup the attachment force the vacuum cup base vacuum cup furthest from the traction point will lift and separate from the tissue causing vacuum leakage leading the cup to pop off . Essentially when that equilibrium is reached and the two pressures equilibrate there is a slow leak. Unexpectedly it was found that the applied vacuum by deforming the cup moves the drug delivery surface towards the tissue . In another unexpected result it was found that the applied vacuum creates axial pressure and radial pull against the affected trauma site tissue moving the tissue towards the drug delivery surface .

In various embodiments of the present invention physical processes can be used to one or both heat and cool the surrounding tissue. In an embodiment of the present invention a thermoelectric generator can form a part of the vacuum cup such that the surface of the generator will contact and encircle the affected tissue. The thermoelectric generator can act as a temperature pump to either heat or cool the contacting tissue. The generator can be constructed of flexible thin film ceramic metal or other semiconductor materials used to generate heat or can be a device utilizing the Peltier effect to cool or heat the contacted tissue. A thermostatic safety switch can be attached to the thermoelectric generator to regulate the temperature of the generator and to act as an electrical safety cut off should the temperature exceed desired or safe limits. A wired connection to the thermoelectric generator can be provided with an electrical connector for the attachment of an external power source.

In an embodiment of the present invention a temperature pump can be used to raise the temperature of the surrounding tissue see .

In an embodiment of the present invention the therapeutic agent and the vacuum can be applied with cooling of the surrounding tissue to vasoconstrict. In an embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying heating the healing process can be improved. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying cooling the healing process can be improved. In another embodiment of the present invention by controlling the blood flow through applying both heating and cooling to the surrounding tissue the healing process can be improved. In an embodiment of the present invention by alternatively applying heating and then cooling the healing process can be improved.

In an embodiment of the present invention chemical agents undergoing physical or chemical processes can be used to one or both heat and cool the surrounding tissue. release or absorption of heat can occur when a substance undergoes enthalpy of solvation enthalpy of a chemical reaction or a phase change. A liquid to gas liquid gas phase changes can have a higher heat of transformation than a solid to liquid solid liquid transitions.

In various embodiments of the present invention hydration materials can be used to cool and or heat the surrounding tissue. In various embodiments of the present invention reactive materials can be used to cool and or heat the surrounding tissue. In various embodiments of the present invention PCMs can be used to cool and or heat the surrounding tissue and to recycle for an unlimited number of cycles within a temperature range. There are numerous PCMs available in the temperature range from 5 C. up to 40 C. that can be useful within several in the range of 20 C. to 30 C. Two or more PCMs with different heating cooling characteristics can also be used simultaneously. As PCMs can perform in small containers a container can be divided into cells. The cells can be shallow to reduce the static head based on the principle of shallow container geometry.

Both organic PCMs and inorganic PCMs can be used in their pure form combined or formulated with other substances to expand their usefulness. Common organic PCMs include paraffin waxes 2 2 dimethyl n docosane CH trimyristin CHCOO CH 1 3 methyl pentacosane CH other polyethylene waxes ethylene bis stearamide N N ethylene bis stearamide which can be used alone or in mixtures thereof. Common inorganic PCMs include anhydrous sodium acetate sodium acetate solutions hydrated salts including sodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate NaHPO.12HO sodium sulfate decahydrate NaSO.10HO ferric chloride hexahydrate FeCl.6HO . Some of these mixtures can have melting temperatures below approximately 5 C. to approximately 23 C. More details can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4 719 028 the contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In an embodiment of the invention PCMs suitable for keeping tissue cool can be solids at ambient temperature having melting points between approximately 30 C. and approximately 50 C. Further eutectic or near eutectic mixtures can be formed. In an embodiment of the invention PCMs suitable for keeping tissue cool can be solids at ambient temperature having melting points between approximately 35 C. and approximately 45 C. In general a PCM with a higher specific heat can be advantageous. In an embodiment of the invention PCMs have a specific heat of at least approximately 1.5 1.9.

In an embodiment of the invention PCMs can be used to control the climate in the air surrounding the tissue. For each application a material a mixture of materials or a formulated material having the desired melting temperature range in the desired operating temperature range can be chosen along with other desirable properties. In an embodiment of the invention PCMs are combined with hygroscopic substances to control the humidity. Examples of hygroscopic materials include calcium chloride zinc chloride potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide sodium chloride sodium iodide and anhydrous copper sulfate.

In addition to containment of PCMs as previously discussed encapsulation of PCMs can also be possible not only for containment but for increased flexibility and property improvement. For example micro encapsulation can allow PCMs to be incorporated into the vacuum cup construction materials. Micro encapsulated PCMs includes coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating. In this form inorganic PCMs can be transformed into material that can be exposed to air or water or be transformed from being hygroscopic to non hygroscopic. Molecular encapsulation is another technology that can enclose a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. Molecular encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.

Some of the PCMs mentioned above can be recyclable in that they can undergo phase changes for an almost infinite number of times. Others can be more like endothermic agents and thus can have a limited life cycle unless handled under a controlled environment. These endothermic agents can lose their effectiveness as a phase change material even when handled under a controlled environment. In an embodiment of the present invention even the limited life cycle PCM can be useful for cargo containers.

In an embodiment of the present invention a therapeutic agent can be infused to the wound site and or the tissue surrounding the wound site using a hypodermic needle through an infusion port vernacular rubber septum see .

In various embodiments of the present invention the agent delivery can be one shot or continuous infusion.

In an embodiment of the present invention both positive and negative pressure can be applied within the cup to the surrounding tissue to improve the healing process see and . In this embodiment the cup utilizes both positive and negative pressure sources provided at connection ports which includes both vacuum ports and positive pressure ports . An expandable chamber which may be in a balloon or piston configuration constructed such that the expansion surface is directed towards the base of the cup to ultimately contact the tissue surface . Vacuum pressure is supplied by integral channels to the interior of the cup to effect the previously described controlled collapse and subsequent attachment of the cup to the affected tissue surface. The desired vacuum pressure is maintained at the connection port prior to the application of pressure to the positive pressure port . The atmospheric pressure is shown in as . Positive pressure is provided by a channel to the interior of the expansion chamber to expand its dimensional configuration in a controlled downward direction. The unexpected result is that the per square inch pressure at directly applied to the general wound location can exceed the ambient surface atmospheric pressure due to the pressure differential created by the vacuum pressure within the interior of the cup. The maximum applied pressure at the trauma site is determined by the ratio of the area of the expansion surface as compared to the exterior surface area of the cup where APmax Maximum Applied Pressure AoC Surface Area of Cup Exterior AoE Surface Area of Expansion Surface 14.5 psi Ambient Air Pressure and APmax 14.5 AoC AoE . The resulting phenomenon provides a self sustained compression at the wound area.

In an embodiment of the invention a simulated vacuum cup for use in a teaching environment can include one or more of the novel features of the invention but is not a working embodiment of the invention. That is the simulated vacuum cup may be able to apply positive and negative pressure allow a hypodermic needle to be attached to the simulated vacuum cup without the ability to apply the agent through the hypodermic needle. This would make sense where the intention was to teach paramedics hospital personnel first responders and Army medics with the device in a simulated environment and working with either an animal model e.g. porcine or a model or dummy.

The present invention relates generally to the field of surgery and delivery of pharmaceutically active agents from a vacuum cup that can be positioned over a wound or trauma site to slow or completely stop bleeding. The device can deliver pharmaceutical agents including those that assist hemostasis blood flow regulators that cause vasoconstriction coagulators blood clotting agents sterilization including antibiotic agents directed against bacterial fungal and viral antigens antiseptic agents or other effective wound healing agents including antioxidants vitamins natural nutritional agents that supply agents that facilitate wound healing anti inflammatory agents including steroids and non steroidal anti inflammatory agents NSAIDS COX 2 inhibitors anti histamines antipruritics analgesics anesthetics and antinociception.

In various embodiments of the invention the vacuum cup can be used as a drug delivery device. The method of delivery can include coating the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup with the agent impregnating the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup with the agent applying a biofilm containing the agent to the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup applying a gel containing the agent to the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup applying a cloth containing the agent to the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup applying a foam containing the agent to the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup applying an absorbent material such as cotton containing the agent to the interior surfaces of the vacuum cup and locating cavities containing a liquid agent in the interior of the vacuum cup or a separate chamber containing an agent in the interior of the vacuum cup . That is the vacuum cup for use in connection with arresting or slowing the flow of blood can serve as a receptacle for a pharmaceutically active agent.

Various therapeutic agents can be delivered via the present invention. They include many different types of agents with different uses and are discussed in the following paragraphs. An antihemorrhagic antihaemorrhagic agent is a substance that promotes hemostasis stops bleeding . Antihemorrhagic agents used in medicine have various mechanisms of action. Systemic drugs work by inhibiting fibrinolysis or promoting coagulation. There are several classes of antihemorrhagic drugs. These include antifibrinolytics vitamin K fibrinogen and blood coagulation factors. Locally acting hemostatic agents work by causing vasoconstriction or promoting platelet aggregation e.g. microfibrillar collagen chitosan and styptics . These hemostatic agents can be embedded in a dressing. Microfibrillar collagen hemostat MCH is a topical agent composed of resorbable microfibrillar collagen. It attracts platelets and allows for the formation of a blood clot when it comes into contact with blood. The cup presses the MCH against a bleeding site and the collagen attracts and helps with the clotting process to eventually stop bleeding. Chitosan hemostats are topical agents composed of chitosan and its salts. Chitosan bonds with platelets and red blood cells to form a gel like clot which seals a bleeding vessel. Unlike other hemostat technologies its action does not require the normal hemostatic pathway and therefore continues to function even when anticoagulants like heparin are present. Hemostatic chemicals use Chitosan in commercial products such as roll gauzes and granular powders. Zeolite for example is used in QuikClot a dressing. Styptics anhydrous aluminum sulfate potassium alum or titanium dioxide are a specific type of antihemorrhagic agent that work by contracting tissue causing blood vessels to contract at the site of the wound and thereby to seal the damaged blood vessels.

Vasoconstrictors constrict vessels supplying blood flow. DDAVP 1 deamino 8 D arginine vasopressin or desmopressin a derivative of the diuretic hormone is used to treat patients with factor VIII von Willebrand bleeding disorders hemophilia chronic kidney disease chronic liver disease and patients undergoing operations where large blood loss and or transfusions are required. Other adrenergic agents exhibit vasoconstrictive action including adrenaline.

A topical anesthetic is a local anesthetic that can be used to numb the surface of a body part. They can be used to numb any area of the skin as well as the front of the eyeball the inside of the nose ear or throat the anus and the genital area. Topical anesthetics are available in creams ointments aerosols sprays lotions and jellies. Examples include benzocaine butamben dibucaine lidocaine oxybuprocaine pramoxine proparacaine proxymetacaine and tetracaine also named amethocaine . Some topical anesthetics are for example oxybuprocaine benzocaine and lidocaine. For neuropathic pain centrally acting substances like anticonvulsants pregabalin gabapentin and carbamazepine or antidepressants such as SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline can be used.

Local delivery of analgesia agents to wound sites can reduce pre and postoperative pain while limiting systemic side effects of analgesia. Additional benefits include reduced need for oral narcotics decreased incidence of breakthrough pain and faster return to normal activities. Drug delivery can be regulated through monitoring of the agent delivered. Analgesics include ibuprofen diclofenac ropivicaine bupivacaine or capsaicin. In an embodiment of the invention the analgesic can be delivered with a hyperdermic needle dispensing the analgesic into a sponge. In an embodiment of the invention a gel containing a specific amount of analgesic can be used to topically introduce the analgesic. In an embodiment of the invention an anesthetic such as lidocaine can also be used to numb areas for medical procedures. In an embodiment of the invention an anesthetic such as lidocaine can be present within the inset surrounding the bead on the edge of cup lip and released when the cup is placed on the patient as shown in . A protective strip can be used to isolate the anesthetic from the atmosphere while the cup is stored. Removing the protective strip from the bead and applying the cup to the patient applies the anesthetic to the area surrounding the wound desensitizing the area . An analgesic agent can then be introduced with little discomfort to the patient. In an embodiment of the invention the protective strip can be composed in part of PVA PVP and or PDMV. In an embodiment of the invention moisture from the tissue allows for hydrolysis of the water soluble polymers allowing time release of the active agent. In an embodiment of the invention introduction of an efflorescent material can be used to hydrolyse the water soluble polymer and trigger the release of the active agent.

Topical antipruritics are in the form of creams. The active ingredients usually belong to the following classes antihistamines such as diphenhydramine Benadryl corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone local anesthetics such as benzocaine topical cream Lanacaine counter irritantssuch as mint oil menthol or camphor SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors mirtazapine which has antipruritic effects due to its strong antagonism of the H1 receptor calamine lotioncontaining zinc oxide and iron III oxide paste of sodium bicarbonate and ammonium hydroxide.

Wound healing is the complex process of regenerating dermal and epidermal tissue after skin injury. Matrix Metalloproteinases MMPs which can degrade proteins are essential in breaking down wounded tissues to allow for wound healing. MMPs play a key role in movement of skin cells and can contribute to new blood vessel growth. Topical treatment with MMP 9 and MMP 13 increases the rate of wound healing compared with mammals lacking MMP 9 and or MMP 13 which exhibit a significant delay in macroscopic wound closure and histological re epithelialization. Wound healing can be facilitated by the application of the MMPs or inducers of the MMPs. Hormones can accelerate wound healing examples of such hormones include estrogen leptins deoxyribonucleosides recombinant genetically engineered repifermin and recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor 2.

Epigallocatechin gallate EGCG is the most abundant catechin in tea. EGCG is a potent antioxidant and is found in green tea but not black tea as EGCG is converted into the arubigins in black teas. EGCG is used in many dietary supplements. EGCG can have therapeutic properties for many disorders including cancer. However some studies indicate it can have deleterious effects in binding to and inactivating prescription therapeutic compounds.

Citrate is the conjugate base of citric acid CHO COO where in solution intermediate ions hydrogen citrate ion HCHO and di hydrogen citrate ion HCHO also exist. Citrate is an intermediate in the Krebs tri carboxylic acid cycle TCA . Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex forms acetyl coenzyme A from pyruvate and the cofactors thiamine pyrophosphate lipoamide flavin adenine di nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and coenzyme A. Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl coenzyme A to form citrate. Citrate also reacts in the TCA cycle via aconitate hydratase leading to the regeneration of oxaloacetate which can combine with another molecule of acetyl coenzyme A. Citrate is also involved in fatty acid synthesis after being transported into the cytoplasm and converted to acetyl coenzyme A. Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase is an enzyme which is regulated by citrate and converts acetyl coenzyme A into malonyl coenzyme A. High concentrations of cytosolic citrate can also inhibit glycolysis through its actions on phospho fructokinase. Citrate can also be used to buffer the pH of solutions and some forms of citrate can act as chelating agents. For example tri sodium citrate can chelate calcium ions to inhibit coagulation.

Citric bio flavonoids are a class of poly phenolic plant secondary metabolites containing a ketone group. They are known for their antioxidant activity and health modulating effects. However other researchers indicate that inside the human body bio flavonoids themselves are of little or no direct antioxidant value because the bio flavonoids are poorly absorbed less than 5 with most of what is absorbed being quickly metabolized and excreted as the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them. The citrus bio flavonoids include hesperidin a glycoside of the flavanone hesperetin quercitrin rutin two glycosides of the flavonol quercetin and the flavone tangeritin. Quercetin is the aglycone form of a number of other flavonoid glycosides such as rutin and quercitrin found in citrus fruit buckwheat and onions. Quercetin forms the glycosides quercitrin and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose respectively. Grape skins contain significant amounts of bio flavonoids and as a result both red and white wine contain bio flavonoids. Since red wine is produced by fermentation in the presence of the grape skins red wine has been observed to contain higher levels of bio flavonoids. Contrasting views on the health benefits of bio flavonoids and other poly phenolics such as resveratrol have been presented.

Flavonoids sulphated carbohydrates or terpenoids have been suspected to be the active anti angiogenic components of plant products. Catechins and poly phenols have been suggested to show anti cancer activity. Silymarin a naturally occurring bioflavonoid has also been suggested to exhibit anti cancer effects. It has been proposed that bio flavonoids can contribute to the preventive effect of a plant based diet on chronic diseases. Edible berries have been suggested to posses a broad spectrum of important therapeutic and chemo preventive agents. Studies suggest that the anthocyanins found in berries reduce oxidative stress and assist with neuronal and cognitive functions.

Vitamin E is a generic term for a family of alpha beta gamma and delta tocopherols and corresponding four tocotrienols.

Alpha tocopherol is a fat soluble antioxidant that has been reported to stops the production of reactive oxygen species formed when fat undergoes oxidation.

Glucosamine is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of the polysaccharides chitosan and chitin which compose the exoskeletons of crustaceans and other arthropods. Glucosamine is also present in the cell walls in fungi and many higher organisms. Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of a chain of alternating N acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid sugars found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide consisting of alternative residues of D glucuronic acid and N acetylglucosamine found in the extracellular space. Hyaluron is translocated out of the cell during biosynthesis and is found on the inner surface of the cell membrane. Hyaluron confers upon tissues the ability to resist compression by providing a counteracting swelling force. Sialic acids include N acetylneuraminic acid and N and O substituted derivatives of neuraminic acid. Sialic acids are found widely distributed in animal tissues.
