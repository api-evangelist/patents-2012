title: Vehicle communication, analysis and operation system
abstract: A communication and analysis system can manage data operations with a vehicle centric system. A vehicle that is in a communications link with a network can also manage its activities based on real-time, historical and predictive knowledge, without having this knowledge processing on-board. Such data processing includes the geo-spatial, internal functions and operator specific requirements. The rule based system also incorporates the use patterns of a specific vehicle, or a specific user. A use pattern can be transferred from one operator to another or be shared to assist with navigation and operations. A vehicle operator or vehicle multiple operators can share or upload information that can assist with efficient operations, including fuel conservation and time management. Use patterns can be assigned to geospatial regions and be used for comparative analysis for such activities as efficient operation, safe travel and navigation.

The present invention pertains to the field of vehicle operations and in particular to control and decision management.

The operating mode of an electric vehicle is often characterized by its time until recharge and the options surrounding this. Existing methods of power management to optimize the electric drive mode include rule based control algorithms based on static variables and pattern recognition which can include current driving patterns such as acceleration regenerative braking energy and stop time.

Dynamic programming algorithms have been used based on the knowledge of real time data to model a trip. Simulations have included intelligent traffic systems and global positioning systems technologies in analytical models. Real time traffic data can be analyzed to optimized operations and have been used in geographic scaling to localize the inputs in order to attempt to reduce computational requirements. Vehicle power management systems can include real time traffic data such as traffic flow traffic light stop time traffic congestion and so on in a predictive energy management system.

Efforts to improve performance have included the use of traffic data including traffic flow and intersection light status to determine if alternative routes should be considered as well as vehicle operation modes including vehicle speed transmission gear and state of charge. Trip modeling has included road conditions such as slope and distance incorporating global positioning systems and re routing following the processing of traffic data.

Boll et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 790 976 discloses an on board route selecting device for vehicles with a prescribed capacity of energy storage that takes into account energy supply refuelling recharging locations along possible routes. Boss et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8 014 914 B2 discloses methods of route planning based on the vehicle type of either an internal combustion engine or hybrid.

Woestman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 487 477 discloses the integration of an on board navigation system with the energy management control system for an electric vehicle EV and a hybrid electric vehicle HEV . The vehicle s real time location is continuously monitored expectations of driver demand are determined and vehicle accommodations are made. The system can be configured to include as part of its present vehicle location data on road patterns geography with date and time altitude changes speed limits driving patterns of a vehicle driver and weather. The vehicle accommodations can be configured to use discrete control laws fuzzy logic or neural networks.

Shunder U.S. Pat. No. 8 185 302 B2 discloses a method of determining an optimal fuel usage route using a vehicle based computing system which uses data received through a GPS unit or a wireless telematic device either installed in the vehicle or portable device such as a cell phone. The system aggregates weighted values of possible routes taking into account road related data such as distance braking speed constancy energy generation and projected fuel consumption. Based on adjusted or weighted values the system suggests an optimal route.

However electric vehicle systems are multi variable dynamic systems and there are high computational loads associated with integrating real time traffic data with the energy management systems of these vehicles. Additionally operators are becoming increasingly more connected with informational networks and their expectations are increasing for adaptive mobile vehicle systems that can intelligently manage and integrate the various vehicle operational patterns and systems driver patterns and preferences along with the massive amounts of real time historical and predictive geo spatial data being generated to provide an optimal driving experience. Use of such a system will result in higher electric vehicle performance thereby becoming more widely accepted in comparison to internal combustion engines.

The present invention provides a vehicle communication analysis and operation system including hardware firmware and software for managing vehicles by employing continuous inputs from a vehicle and intelligent correlation with analysis techniques to optimize the driving experience. Correlation analysis techniques enable a software system to self discover and study the relationships between variables. It understands how one metric relates to the variability of another. A rule based system is used to manage the data operations of a vehicle. A vehicle that is in a communications link with a network can also manage its activities based on real time historical and predictive knowledge without having all this knowledge processing on board. Such data processing can include the geo spatial information internal vehicle functions and operator specific requirements.

The real time processing of this information allows for vehicle performance optimization the reduction of network load by pre processing of data and the support via a display on the vehicle to allow internet based commercial and social services to be shared by drivers operators internet communities and other parties of interest such as marketing and third party service solutions.

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a system in which the operational conditions of a vehicle include but are not limited to an internal operational state near space traffic events regional topography patterns of use and relationships with other vehicles and where the real time historical or predictive state or conditions are used in a system that collects internal information from the vehicle or driver or a combination of the two and shares this information on a private or public network. Such a system can provide further analysis and reporting back to a driver operator or vehicle. Such a system may store such information on a mobile network where it may assign indices use pattern data or raw data to a vehicle driver specific location or region.

Referring to there is shown a diagram of an exemplary implementation of a vehicle communications analysis and operations system generally designated and hereinafter referred to as the vehicle operation system which includes system hardware firmware and software components and how they interface within the system and with 3rd party systems. The vehicle operation system designated in using dashed boxes includes a vehicle equipped with a programmable vehicle data system . The vehicle data system contains a processor CPU and a ROM and a RAM coupled to the CPU . The ROM has multiple inputs and outputs and contains firmware which provides static information and instructions to CPU . The RAM contains software that performs the computations necessary for calculating routes reporting and analyzing of vehicle specific data displaying information and managing inputs and outputs. The vehicle data system also includes a data storage device coupled to the CPU for storing user inputted real time and historical data and a transceiver coupled to the CPU for transmitting and receiving data over a wireless communications network.

Inputs and outputs can be any known in the art that allow the vehicle data system to receive and communicate logical data with for instance a user interface such as but not limited to a display audio system keyboard USB flash Bluetooth near field communication or other data transferable ports and mediums and factory or 3party installed vehicle systems. As also shown in the vehicle is also equipped with a security system a GPS or other navigational system operational sensors and environmental sensors . The vehicle data system can also be configured to communicate with the security system the GPS the operational sensors such as accelerometers and optical spatial sensors and the environmental sensors such as CO NOx temperature noise dB and humidity sensors a vehicle s energy management system or a vehicle s operations system.

The RAM of the vehicle data system contains system software for determining the most efficient route or travel plan based on a vehicle s real time data a vehicle s centric data collection and assigned use patterns specific to the vehicle a driver and or a geospatial region. The system software of the RAM may include a data management and processing system generally designated and illustrated in which shows data processing modules and database used within the vehicle operation system . The processing modules are separate software modules but not separate processor memory systems in their own right. Some of these modules are on board and some are off board vehicle some of these modules can be either off board or on board subject to detailed design decisions.

Planning and display of travel plans and travel plan updates within planning modules and multi tiered database for data collection and management are part of the on board vehicle data system . Neither the pattern analysis processing modules nor the personal data modules need be on board those modules can be run at network operations and data centre of the vehicle operation system seen in or other networked computers and or servers. Personal data key has a user s preferences and vehicle driver use patterns and can be in communication with vehicle data system on board network enabled vehicle .

Referring again to the network operations and data centre contains a real time communications server in communication with a data processing server . These are shown as separate servers in communication with each other in but they may also be part of a single server. The real time communications server collects and communicates real time data from vehicles and drivers within the network as well as from 3party and public data systems. Data processing server contains system processing module specific firmware and software for managing and processing disparate data including vehicle specific data public data and vehicle and driver use pattern data also referred to as efficiency data which can be categorized within the pattern analysis modules shown in . Real time analysis for analyzing real time data and historical database for post processed data along with personal data modules can also be employed within data processing server . The data is synchronized correlated and packaged for use by on board trip planning modules to provide dynamic mapping of vehicle routing also referred to herein as travel plans and updated plans and to communicate them to vehicles and users within the network including vehicle driver s phone driver s computer a fleet manager s phone a fleet manager s computer a fleet server and 3party systems such as mobile rescue refuel vehicle .

In another embodiment of the system vehicle data system may be a user s smartphone configured to communicate with other entities within the vehicle analysis and operation systems network as well as with systems on board the vehicle and remote 3party systems.

In there is shown the data processing modules and database of the data management and processing system used within the vehicle operation system shows user configurable settings and preferences within the system . There are five categories which can be used to describe features and components within the data management and processing system namely external and geo spatial data of the pattern analysis modules planning and display for travel plans and travel plan updates within the planning module multi tiered database for data collection and management personal data modules and user preferences see . The arrows between the modules are representative of the directional flow of data between the processing modules either in a unidirectional or bidirectional flow of data. These processing modules make up a software package required to perform the disparate processing functions of the vehicle operation system of the present invention. Some of the software modules are run on a network enabled vehicle some are run on off board computers and servers within the network including network data centre and some are run both on and off networked vehicle . User software can also be installed on user computer systems such as vehicle data system a driver s computer a vehicle manager s computer and a fleet company s server . The user software processes user and vehicle specific packaged data derived from vehicle and driver use patterns also referred to herein as efficiency data vehicle specific data user settings and preferences dependent data and third party data such as localized geo spatially relevant public data containing mapping utilities grade elevation and traffic systems for a localized area.

The data management and processing system uses the multi tiered database which comprises three major distributed parts namely the vehicle centric data collection or user input system on board networked vehicle the real time communications and analysis system on and off board networked vehicle and the post processing or historical database on and off board networked vehicle . The vehicle centric real time data may be used to manage a vehicle without dependence upon a real time communications uplink . It can provide analysis based on sensor data from operational sensors and environmental sensors and this can be combined with user or system updated patterns. The real time communications and analysis system includes vehicle centric data including any on board vehicle data such as the vehicle s operations and energy management systems data from post processing or historical database data from third party systems such as public geo spatial data and data from other vehicles. The post processing database also known as the historical database can create user context specific information and more generalized scenario management which may be used to provide the basis for database comparison prioritisation and content .

A context driven analysis system allows for specific use cases to be analysed using a variety of mathematical algorithms. Such an analysis can be performed outside of the real time interface database. Such comparative systems allow for data to be used in a combination of randomized and deterministic algorithms where their use depends upon previously known or preset relationships where the probability of an event or anomaly detection is dependent upon the normal operations of a vehicle in comparison with real time data or with post analysis data or user determined settings. In essence a set of operational parameters establish the normal expected response. Based on variations in operation performance or expected performance a set of business rules or operational guidelines will be automatically enabled. In one aspect of the vehicle operation system of the present invention the prioritization of actions are broken down into use case processing that is dependent upon user associated rules or reporting requirements.

One aspect of the vehicle operation system of the present invention is to include a systems user profile that can either manage the preferences of the user or set automated prioritization based on prior use. Such prior use may include vehicle operational habits such as acceleration route track time of day as might be used to characterize the normal human impacts on a vehicle. Such a user profile can be transferred to different vehicles or used in a comparative analysis to optimize the use of vehicles in a similar pattern using either real time analysis systems or post analysis. Patterns of analysis can be used to describe the user preferences for distinct geographical areas allowing vehicle performance optimization or driver guidance to avoid or manage areas of complex navigation or allowing driver social media applications.

The rule based system as will be discussed herein below under the sub heading Rules has both vehicle centric and networked components and the vehicle can drive either autonomously or in real time communication with it s networked guidance systems. Vehicle centric systems allow for optimization of vehicle performance parameters using predictive methods that interpret such characteristics as slope location and speed. For example wheel torque under constant rotation speed or speed under constant torque or regenerative braking can thus be modified to perform based on anticipated conditions and real time performance versus expected performance can be shared amongst vehicles on a similar route. Control elements such as a continuously variable transmission benefits from such anticipated actions to manage fuel consumption or regenerative brake use. Certain vehicle use cases involve a rule based system to optimize user variable software tools and enable communication with both vehicle centric or networked software tools or games. Certain types of vehicle centric data can be shared between vehicles and the data can be packaged as the solution to multiple algorithms such as piecewise functions including polynomial representations of data intervals.

With the vehicle operation system of the present invention predictive analysis can be applied to many vehicle use cases. Active analysis of a vehicle can be used to both optimize and share vehicle performance characteristics. Vehicle telematics can be used in conjunction with network components including computational precedents from apriori analysis in order to optimize fleet management and predictive analysis such as use availability maintenance safety security social media applications and refuelling. Navigation systems can further optimize the systems performance to create route preferences based on immediate requirements such as home base return power calculations including potential energy requirements total energy available kinetic energy capture fleet requirements fastest route shortest route most fuel efficient route or safest route. Mobile data can be shared in two way communication with the vehicle and the management systems enabling real time optimization of third party software including games and fleet functions.

A reporting system described in detail hereinafter in reference to packages data to simplify usage trends from vehicle systems use to drivers and network operators. The report of specific vehicle operations to drivers and network operators and other interested parties such as vehicle manufacturers and marketing agencies allow them to be more intuitive about the ongoing operations on board vehicles without the need for a constant data stream. Data processing creates a predicted operational profile and a post analysis profile which can be presented as an algorithm interpolation and the comparison of the variables can be efficiently made without ever having to transmit all the vehicle data. Such data sets can be scaled to manage data transmission such that only change related data in the form of an algorithm variable needs to be transmitted either to or from a vehicle. Such processing of data optimizes the use of data such that in many cases the transmission of some data does not need to be transmitted in real time via a mobile network. This is particularly the case for high resolution data that does not represent any significant change the on board vehicle processing system being able to determine the relevance or significance of data intervals. Some data can be stored on a network server or on board the vehicle and transferred between the vehicle the server the driver or other networked component on or off the vehicle or other vehicles by a mobile data system such as either a Wi Fi drivers personal data memory card or when network demand is reduced. This will have a dramatic effect of the scalability of the systems allowing the smallest packets of real time data transmission and reducing the network burden.

The data stored on a network server can be mined for anonymous vehicle profiles and driver profiles for use by marketing agencies and vehicle manufacturers to improve on their designs and better understand customer use cases operational criteria and other factors leading to customer value propositions and requirements and market evolution factors. A change report can be in the form of a difference between the predicted and actual performance the routing performance the battery performance vehicle faults driver preferences driver performance status reports security reports and other variables as might be expected in the normal operation of a vehicle. Driver preferences can be in the form of pre or post driving questions that the driver or the network can generate to further optimize performance. These preferences can be shared with other drivers or network operators to encourage best practice use patterns.

A corporate fleet managed system has different operational requirements than a social group or an individual. A fleet might already have its own operational software and only be looking for specialized vehicle indicators only such as time or distance to recharge in order to manage deliveries or services within a certain area. In this case the need for performance criteria is very much determined by the practical business rules for the fleet. A social group might wish to optimize their group performance to drive where there is little traffic or along a scenic route or drive as an input to a game scenario. An individual may wish to improve the personal driving habits or refine route preferences while driving.

Vehicle identification can be in the form of a personal profile of the driver and a profile of the vehicle performance or some combination of these features. A driver may have a performance profile that can be used to modify vehicle performance criteria to suit the driver for instance route profiles or the actual physical characteristics of the driver such as height and weight may change the predictive route mapping or other on board vehicle parameters such as torque speed or suspension settings or ergonomic factors such as mirror or seat adjustments.

As a result the invention allows for the real time vehicle adjustments and post analysis all which can be made based on type of vehicle driver history regional driving trends and conditions and associative relationships between vehicles.

The invention calls for multiple vehicle communications methods within a distributed operational system with a mobile data network including cellular Wi Fi internet and other methods as is known to one familiar with the art. A subscription model can allow for web enabled social networking of vehicle communications on a use case basis.

Each vehicle system is designed to operate with or without the communications network. The vehicle is always associated with a user profile whether it is owned leased rented etc. The vehicle operator pair become a rule specific entity in a distributed learning network whereby the identity of an operator can be used to drive any vehicle and that vehicle will by nature of the operator data take on the preferred characteristics of the operator into its vehicle centric operational system.

The vehicle operator pair are the top tier in computational performance a vehicle centric system is supported by the communications and post processing data layers. In this manner if the communications link with the network is not available the vehicle centric system can continue to function in a predictive manner by using a priori data.

In this manner a vehicle that is following a known route can also follow known patterns of use regardless of if the communications link with the network is active. A driver or network operator or an automated system can use the use pattern data to characterize route preferences that allow for easy interpretation of local conditions in a predictive or real time situation such interpretation allowing for the intuitive display of such information.

Knowledge upload to a personal data service key see and can occur using a mobile data network link such as a web enabled hotspot or cellular phone. Certain operational preferences can be uploaded to an operators personal data key and these transferred to the vehicle on start up or during operation. This allows for certain operational parameters to be set such as mathematical operators such as algebraic or functional analysis computational limits such as time and resolution and optimized algorithms to reduce data set size.

In one embodiment of the invention there is called for a personal data key and the uses of certain patterns of operation certain digital codes as might be input on a keypad a pattern of use and a combination of physical hardware such as a subscriber identity module or SIM card or other hardware or software key that might be uniquely attributed to either a driver or vehicle in order to transfer operator driver or vehicle data for a specific vehicle use case. In such manner a vehicle can be secured to be functional in a specific manner only for instance for fleet operations or for a specific time period or specific user or group of users only. It is possible that a vehicle can be secured to accept the use keys of multiple drivers or guest drivers and that driver preferences can be adapted to associate with multiple vehicles such as rental vehicles for instance.

In one embodiment a use case for a security system see is the integration with commonly understood geomatics technology. Owner operator preferences adjust the sensitivity of a security response to real time data and can also provide notification of a vehicle optimal state to manage the geospatial conditions. Further the vehicle can incorporate geospatial analysis or patterns to ensure that the vehicle is being operated in an optimal state.

In the case of antitheft requirements an owner operator preference based system may be deployed that allows the set up and authentication of systems at the point of purchase allowing manufacturers to defer the cost of verifying network installation prior to shipping. In this case a separate personal data service key or SIM can be separately installed using an interface standard such as a hardwired USB ethernet serial proprietary parallel wireless transponder Bluetooth Wi Fi 802.11a b g n Zigbee wireless USB or other connection. This separation of the digital authentication from the vehicle can be used to disable some functions on the vehicle making it more difficult or impossible to drive or setting a communications based alarm or other reporting functions as might be part of normal vehicle operations.

The personal data key can have two physical components allowing the vehicle key to be used separately from the user preferences data see or allowing a driver to have multiple vehicle keys and a vehicle to have multiple drivers.

The personal data key can be a programmable digital key that records certain driving habits and as such becomes the storage medium for the driver personality data. This personal data key can also allow for group data and social media data to be stored in preferences. The personal data key relates the vehicle to the driver and driver to the vehicle enables security activation normal operator instructions directions and other data as might be considered useful such as social data and applications. A driver s smartphone can be used as a personal data key.

Each vehicle and operator is a separate entity in the network. This allows for either a vehicle or an operator to be associated independently. A vehicle might allow multiple operators for either personal or business reasons and a driver operator might have his or her profile associated with multiple vehicles. The vehicle and driver environment can be constantly updated based on the predetermined preferences or settings. These preferences can act as inputs to a rule based system further allowing for optimization of real time processing requirements due to the limited need for complex multivariate change analysis. For instance the predictive aspects of what is happening on a driver s display can be displayed or shared on a network without a real time update.

In one embodiment a vehicle can be equipped with a vehicle data system having a display with a multi screen or layered ability. The screen may have security features such as not allowing some functions to display while the vehicle is in motion. When some characteristic of the driving conditions changes from what is normal or what is expected then there can also be a change in the communications between the vehicle and the network. Transmitting normalized data such as the interpolated difference from predicted or normal operation the vehicle data system can be updated to be viewed either on board the vehicle or on a networked screen at a different location or on another vehicle. Accordingly the invention allows for an on board or networked vehicle data system to display either the actual high resolution data or the normalized data. This can be done in real time or in a more optimized fashion to reduce network data load. A vehicle data system can replace or be next to a conventional analog dashboard or components can be represented on a heads up display on a windscreen or helmet screen. In this way the rule based system can examine data in a prioritized manner based on the degree of change and this can be further optimized by predetermined priorities in data management for example one vehicle may have greater priority over another for security or emergency requirements. Vehicles with refuelling risks may be observed with a greater resolution of the vehicle data in order to reduce the challenges to the driver to manage destinations stops and routing efficiency. Some geographical areas may require more efficient or higher resolution data analysis based on prior experience or by information provided by recent vehicle reports on the same route providing both drivers and network operators the opportunity to interpret optimal driving conditions.

In another aspect of the vehicle operation system of the present invention a geospatial area or location may have characteristics that are assigned to it that can serve to automatically update driver or vehicle preferences and enable the use of geospatial preferences as a means of searching a routing database to see which areas have been tagged with certain characteristics. Examples of this might be an area with bad road conditions an area that stresses vehicle operations an area that is difficult to navigate or an area that has been noted as notoriously dangerous. In this manner both vehicle performance and driver input can be used to identify driving characteristics. Driver input can be made in post analysis.

A vehicle in the network works as a separate entity able to determine some of the attributes of one or more other vehicles referencing both historical and real time information and able to provide limited processing ability on board the vehicle or able to prompt the real time communications and analysis system by either an automated event or by user driver prompt. Each vehicle entity is subsequently indirectly in contact with other proximate vehicles through the network for those vehicles allowing shared communication. Further communication with internet applications can allow a variety of third party shared user functions or applications.

Because the evaluation process and location determination of entities are spread over a number of vehicles or vehicle operator pairs and there is vehicle centric pre processing there is a faster evaluation and less data traffic over the network than if the central database were used to perform all the analysis and reporting evaluations and location determinations or requests. Hence the operator can become part of the real time programming process and the results of his decisions are used in post processing analysis.

Additionally each vehicle and driver can have a set of rules that apply to them to enable the communications network. Each entity can reduce the amount of network data processing by examining data on an event basis which will produce constant results for a time period. If so an entity can for example eliminate the analysis complexity or the reporting requirements for real time data.

A vehicle with operational sensors such as multiple accelerometers can derive the variations in conditions such as vehicle vibrations or acceleration in multiple axes. These in turn can be integrated to determine velocity or displacement. Patterns of accelerometer data can be used to characterize vehicle performance and when using pattern analysis can be used to determine vehicle operational parameters such as load road conditions tire and suspension performance. Other sensors such as optical spatial sensors for road surface condition determination and environmental sensors such as CO NOx temperature noise dB and humidity sensors can be used as inputs to a vehicle specific data system as is known to one skilled in the art.

Driver actions are monitored on the vehicle centric system to allow for vehicle actions to be used as response mechanisms in the vehicle centric analysis system. For instance an accelerometer system can monitor the vehicle turning acceleration or braking and a series of events inclusive of any turning acceleration or braking can be used to either prompt the system or respond to the system. For example a series of two or more accelerometers can be used in a steering handle which allows a driver to use tapping motions to communicate using finger taps while steering for instance without removing his or her hands from the handle.

Reporting can be based on the results of spatial rules and performed as specified for a spatial rule or can be based on non spatial activities and actions on the part of the vehicle or operator which can then impact the weighting of spatial rules. A reporting action can include communications with a vehicle where certain functions can be optimized for performance. Such rules allow for the integration of operator actions predictive data historical data and real time data to be used to optimize vehicle performance.

For instance an operation can be a prompt or internal network validation method or a command or message to the operator or driver to follow a path that is known to be more economical for fuel consumption rather than the shortest route.

Such a message might be in the form of a graphic as is typical of internet mapping functions such as Google Maps.

Alerts and actions see can be provided in other forms such as text messages audible warnings including an interactive voice response system graphics and icons to improve the simplicity of the communication.

The five categories used to describe features and components within the data management and processing system four of which are shown in include the external and geo spatial data of the pattern analysis modules planning and display for plans and plan updates within the planning module multi tiered database and personal data . The fifth user personal preferences is shown in along with the processing modules affected by a user s desired setting configurations and preferences. These are vehicle specific data user database system real time analysis and the post processing or historical database .

The vehicle specific data systems can include but are not limited to such operational sensors and environmental sensors to measure battery level real time battery demand torque regenerative braking status speed direction motor temperature battery temperature and tire pressure temperature and humidity measured at the vehicle accelerometer data about road surface grade or air quality. These may be used separately or in combinations to enhance vehicle operations especially energy efficient travel. Public data can include information such as grade elevation temperature traffic conditions in a mapping utility that can be used to evaluate the most efficient trip. A historical database is used to enhance the geospatial data to assure that patterns from various vehicles can be compared to evaluate the most efficient trip with the efficiency patterns data module . This in turn can be processed via a real time analysis system database for later use or for context driven comparison for other unrelated vehicles. In combination these elements can be used to create dynamic mapping that provides efficient travel plans and in combination with real time data can provide a real time analysis and an updated travel plan . The ability to update plans in real time provides a measure of efficiency and the display of this to the user allows for user input to impact further decision making. Drivers can also respond to prompts from the system using physical movements measured by sensors or other methods such as speech audible or visual cues. The real time analysis system shares data with the updated plans module captures data from the user input database and the vehicle specific data and then performs an iterative analysis that updates the personal user pattern profile and the historical database . This is managed through a secure communications uplink a time scaled data analysis and security communications . The historical database can share information on the basis of post analysis modules including context comparison and prioritization with the efficiency patterns module and can have multiple tiers of data to be shared but secured at a private personal level a systems subscription level and a public level such as a personal profile to be published that can automatically update to social media such as Facebook or Twitter. A personal data key will allow personal data vehicle data and security codes to be used to verify operations of the vehicle and the systems interface including updates from the historical database to the secure user pattern profile and to allow the system to update the published profile and communication with a personal user database system that allows for updates to user preferences especially those of planning and performance .

Electric vehicle optimization can be achieved with algorithms that incorporate vehicle performance feedback on a real time basis in coordination with user specific patterns and shared data in an real time network. The state of charge of a battery is one measure of performance on a route that can be used to compare patterns with other vehicles.

A dynamic algorithm is applied to generate a trip model and a driving cycle based on driver s itinerary input which includes geographical data such as departure destination and preferred route and time data such as departure time and arrival time. When the historical data of the preferred route is used to optimize the performance the conditions of previous trips of the same vehicle or those of other vehicles can be used as reference. In a down scaling of traditional public traffic data there may not be enough relevant data to provide a route adjustment however real time data from other vehicles in a similar route pattern may give local information to adjust either the route or the drive cycle. A continuous Markov decision process is one method whereby a reward function can be calculated and associated with battery performance or other vehicle performance characteristics. These in turn can be compared to expected results. Further a down scaling of data to respond in only certain circumstances allows algorithms to be optimized to run only on demand or based on a trigger such as a change in vehicle performance a time or a location based event. Such an event can be characterized by one of the many existing methods of monitoring of charge depletion control however the data can be used in an optimization based on historical patterns or in a comparison with predictive data.

The acceleration and deceleration model of a specific individual vehicle that compensates for distances and times associated with speed change cycles such as stop start and slow down speed up patterns are used in a model where driving conditions and real time assessment of event related analysis can include operating cost energy use spatial components of delay or surge in comparison to the anticipated results.

Acceleration velocity and displacement can all be used in a model that further processes data to enable a comparative performance on the same route between vehicles or between the same vehicle at a different time. Retention of peak and mean acceleration data for a period of a trip can be used rather than retaining all the data from the trip. Similarly a derivative of the displacement in a period or interest can be the constant acceleration which can be compared to the instantaneous acceleration at any time. Performance measures such as total tractive force mass speed acceleration energy rate efficiency parameter which relates to electric energy consumed provided by the power train an efficiency parameter which relates to electric energy consumed during acceleration and efficiency parameters based on trip time battery energy dynamic state of the vehicle such as vehicle speed regenerative energy battery state of charge can also be used to create patterns of use on a route. These and other patterns of systems performance can be used to compare real time vehicle operations to predicted values and be used by drivers to adapt driving techniques or select new routes to further optimize performance.

Furthermore performance criteria can be adjusted to provide the real time data that can assist drivers to attain their immediate needs which might be finding the shortest path finding the quickest path or using the least amount of energy.

Display of the data can be such that predictive parameters can be displayed in comparison to real time parameters or historical patterns and a suggested operational plan can be presented to the driver in order to meet the desired objectives. Such a display can compare acceleration speed distance or direction and make suggestions of these parameters.

Referring to the system operates in a reporting analysis and iterative cycle process where each of these reporting analysis and interaction features provides an opportunity for vehicle drivers and operators to interact with the process to define their requirements.

The reporting aspect of the network has three outputs display of relevant data alerts of events based on preferences and the creation of reports such as may be required to satisfy the rules of the iterative cycle or the display of real time driving data. The reporting module gathers information from the vehicle centric systems and analysis modules vehicle specific data the driver user input a historical database or from public data .

The analysis aspect of the network gathers information from the alert and report systems and also responds to events such as travel plans and serves to update travel plans . The analysis aspect can have separate portions that function at the historical real time user input personal data key or efficiency patterns data module . There are three components to the analysis module computational classification and prediction . Accordingly the invention calls for the analysis of data to include the integration derivativation or exclusion of certain events to be compared in a timeline using a variety of methods and types of algorithms whereby a predictive analysis can be made by comparing the prior events.

In the vehicle operation system of the present invention one type of decision and probability analysis consists of forward chaining where the existing data is combined with a process of making a logical judgment based on the apriori circumstances and conclusions that were used as the basis for apriori input to rules and the use of these apriori inputs and circumstances to extract more data until a postulate can be made. The process using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where a logical truth can be inferred with some probability a consequent which can add more data to the existing data classification or rules around the apriori circumstances.

Yet further another type of decision and probability analysis consists of backward chaining where an expected result can be used in context with the apriori circumstances and conclusions that were used as the basis for a priori input to rules and the existing circumstances or the results of forward chaining to determine if the circumstances for the expected results are likely and the probability of this.

In some cases the analysis system presents only the probability of a situation matching known apriori circumstances and conclusions and that these are always considered to have some weighting of accuracy. However for the simplicity of real time calculations the algorithm can sometimes use apriori data to match events with modus ponens inference.

The iterative cycle aspect of the network shown in has three major components including decision management requirements and rules . The rules component gathers information from the computational classification and prediction aspects. The iterative cycle uses this information in the decision management context to update travel plans to display options to prompt for user input to modify the published profile and to validate the secure user pattern profile and the real time communications and analysis system including the event operations security communications time scaled data analysis and communications uplink data . The iterative requirements are preset by user preferences or use case including specialist knowledge or ambient conditions data .

The network and its components are shown in with reference to how the components are connected to the network using an application programming interface or API. There are the mobile data network API s and the network server API s which connect the vehicles to the various services.

The vehicle data system API is the API between network specific application services or 3rd party data system application services and the supplied libraries that will allow access to vehicle functions or driver communication with functions or with applications interface with local services. Examples can include functions to do driver notifications through a common queuing and display system access track information or to populate additional layers on the map display with 3rd party info. Such an API can use a Java interface or other software standards as is well known.

The vehicle services API is the API between data system applications and network data centre that will allow access to information and services encapsulated therein. Examples can include access to historical track information and real time information such as nearby internetwork or intranetwork friends as well as providing a conduit through the data centre to any Internet based applications utilizing the network infrastructure services API to provide fleet support such as emergency road services for instance. Some aspects of the vehicle services API are only available to network software modules on the data system such as session log in position reporting whilst others are open to third party applications. This API can use a JSON or XML based web interface with security and other enhancements or other software standards as is well known.

The driver services API is the API between a mobile application such as a program running natively on the mobile data network such as the driver phone or vehicle manager phone or other mobile device and the network data centre . It allows access to a subset of functionality that is typically needed by third party mobile applications to interact with the network system and vehicles. Examples can include the ability to be notified of and control vehicle security events driver safety or other complex information to be pushed to the vehicle or for the driver to update the network preferences or to message internetwork or intranetwork friends. This API can use a JSON or XML based web interface with security and other enhancements or other software standards as is well known.

The infrastructure services API is a set of APIs between third party applications which can be either Internet or mobile based that allow integration of independent software providers to support and be supported by the network eco system. This API set can encapsulate the driver services and vehicle services APIs and then add functionality specific to fleets and corporate applications. It can be secured via a security certificate or other permission so to be available to approved connections. This API can use a JSON or XML based web interface with security and other enhancements or other software standards as is well known.

The charging services API is the API between network data centre and battery management systems such as charge brokering services and charging stations including battery management technologies mobile charging vehicles and electricity or other fuel suppliers allowing the secure exchange of information related to charging events and the brokering of financial transactions for charging services by third parties to the vehicle and drivers. Examples can include communications related to battery or charge point reservation power and or battery pricing and actual charging transactions. This API can use a JSON or XML based web interface with security and other enhancements or other software standards as is well known.

To better understand how the network components and their API s function in a vehicle operation system of an exemplary use case system architecture is shown in . A vehicle shown in as an electric scooter having a vehicle data system is in communication with the network data centre using vehicle services API . The scooter s on board vehicle data system is in communication with GPS system for location determination. The driver s phone and fleet manager s smartphone or handheld which may also contain a GPS component communicates with the network data centre using driver services API . The fleet server is in communication with the data centre using an infrastructure services API . The driver s computer and fleet supervisor s computer communicate over the internet with data centre . Third Party services such as charging station communicate with the data centre using a charging services API while a mobile rescue vehicle service may communicate over a mobile network using an infrastructure services API that includes vehicle services API .

The network architecture or components may be changed to allow for virtual infrastructure such as backup and recovery processes to improve efficiency and mobility. Social media may have multiple impacts on architecture including methods to protect the network from unauthorized use. As network usage expands to include clients customers and personal associative relationships so does the need to improve and protect the personal information of vehicles drivers operators or network components. Increased virtual communication across a network can improve social metrics and customer service and increase demand for hierarchal management and monitoring techniques. The network architecture can be adjusted according to the needs of security including those features which include web security hacker attacks denial of service secure messaging and other features as required and known to one skilled in the art.

Together all these components form a communications system and mobile data network which is designed to allow vehicle function with none any or all features in operation. Programming of preferences can be as simple as the systems monitoring the vehicle or driver operations and making automated adjustments or by the driver or owner or operator setting preferences either on the vehicle or by interfacing with the network including the personal data key .

A typical rule based system can be enabled on the basis of real time events or by post analysis. There are typically application interfaces with business rules or utility controls and often in a network environment. In some cases a user interface can be used to allow communication with the rules to optimize functions. The programming techniques of rule based systems and expert systems are common knowledge to those familiar with decision management systems.

A set of rules is deployed within the data network in multiple centers of decision management. In the vehicle operation system of the present invention the technique of rule based systems is being used with a distributed architecture that will allow systems to function whether or not in communication with the network and in doing so the rule based architecture on the vehicle is designed to primarily process real time vehicle data while the networked architecture is designed to monitor the results of the numerous vehicle rule systems and compare these to expected results. User preferences can allow selective communication between the vehicle and the network allowing some information to remain private and within the driver s personal network and post processing database and some to be published to the driver s media portal and some to be published to the network operator s database for post analysis and sharing between vehicles. In this manner any number of rule based scenarios can be compared and managed for different purposes. A rule scenario for determining the fastest route through a city grid at a certain time is very different to a rule scenario that might determine the most energy efficient route or to sustain travel for an extended period. The priorities of rules and their weighting can change and enable the vehicle operator to determine what information to display on the user interface.

Conservation rules include an effort to improve the use of a vehicle battery a number of features on the vehicle are being monitored in order to allow for conservation of vehicle energy by suggesting performance criteria to the driver or by providing automated controls or alerts based on vehicle performance during certain drive cycles.

Social rules include the ability to share information between drivers and vehicles in order to allow users to participate in internet based utilities or to share driver preferences and data. These can be further adapted to be specialized rules between certain vehicles for personal reasons or for gaming or business needs.

Reporting rules include those rules where drivers may set the reporting requirements of a specific vehicle or their real time or post analysis reporting to enable it to be used for processing in certain ways including performance measures to be used privately or for sharing of data to enhance comparative analysis between vehicles and or between similar routes.

Rate of change rules include an expected change happens within some time domain. Rate changes can be modified to alert on the basis of the first significant change and the preferences can be set for follow on alerts to assure the over sending of alerts does not desensitize the driver to significant detail.

Vehicle anthropomorphism rules include the ability to create a profile for a vehicle that renders it to have simulated characteristics in its performance or data reporting capabilities or in its social networking such as a vehicle having its own cyber identity that can enable other vehicles or operators to associate with it given a rule based environment. Accordingly vehicles can be given features that are popular with other drivers or automatically associative with other vehicles and drivers based on physical features vehicle type vehicle owner or any other feature that might help to characterize the vehicle. Vehicle associative rules can interpret real time vehicle performance data driver entered vehicle profile historical performance records performance in a specific vehicle location performance in comparison to other vehicles usage data environmental data and other relevant data to enable the performance reporting or social networking characteristics of the vehicle to simulate human like characteristics. Such characteristics can include specific moods such as a change in dash color conservative acceleration and health indicators of optimal performance vehicle situational opinions such as preferred choices of route. Vehicle opinions can also include driver vehicle and vehicle vehicle relationships modeled after a human relationship such as prompts from a vehicle that it has features in common with another vehicle or that it has preferences for with respect to another vehicle all customized by owners drivers or operators to the cyber world.

Such rules may be implemented to interact with functions of the vehicle and may be weighted by the vehicle owner and or operator to help the vehicle meet environmental operational social and ease of use requirements. These components of a vehicle operation system and mobile data network allow for many additional features and applications to be added to a vehicle and driver interface. In one embodiment of the invention the network will allow for an interface for third party applications and services to be added on to the network at a network operator s or driver s choice. This interface can be in the form of an online store where the network sets the standards and performance requirements for vehicles based on any of the features in the total system.

The vehicle operation system of the present invention will now be described with reference to specific examples. It will be understood that the following examples are intended to describe embodiments of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in any way.

A vehicle operating system can examine travel records and indices for isolated areas to create a travel plan that will compare a proposed route for an electric vehicle to the data that has been shared by other similar electric vehicles in order to determine the probability of being able to complete a journey with a particular certainty. The database is mined for travel records from other vehicles that have traveled that route. Algorithms determine whether there is a quorate amount of data in the database and if there is then use the mined data to adjust any proposed route. This serves to resolve the anxiety that a driver might have about taking on a certain journey including making stops or detours and still being able to complete the journey without risk of total battery depletion. By allowing drivers to modify plans simply by making vehicle operation changes the real time analysis systems can support adaptive processing based on prior known patterns of drivers habits optimal vehicle performance and real time or previously known conditions or changes.

A vehicle operating system can use a personal data service key to enable the security features of a vehicle that identifies that vehicle and pairs the vehicle with the driver. In the case of a rental vehicle for instance the vehicle automatically adjusts itself to the user preferences or settings of the driver such that the driver s rule settings do not have to be re entered. A driver s rule settings may include their preferred route driving style range warning types and levels among others. The vehicle operational data can also be shared with the driver and the driver can have this secured onto the personal data service key in the event the network can not be reached by the vehicle. This can be used for instance to save driver patterns to identify a driver by subscription driver style billing preferences insurance premiums and other characteristics that can be attributed to driver vehicle behaviour.

A vehicle operating system can use network features to interpret the geospatial characteristics of a region to integrate with locally known or shared features of the region to enable a driver who is previously unfamiliar with an area to be able to take a route that satisfies rules for efficiency that otherwise are only known to those who have local knowledge. Drivers can adjust their response to proposed changes in routes based on their intuitive response and can accept or decline new route choices or prompt the network for further options including opening a call with a customer service representative.

One commercial application is a location based service such as a proximity based refuelling or recharging delivery service. In a typical scenario a recharging merchant is notified when a low energy vehicle customer is within some distance of a mobile outlet and desires assistance upon which the mobile refuelling or recharging service vehicle can assist the customer. Another commercial application is to apply geofencing solutions. Such applications are well known to one familiar with the art including commercial vehicle fleet operations. Custom digitized virtual fences can be drawn on and around desired locations so that when a geo tracked and fenced vehicle or mobile user enters or exits a geo fence an alert or report is generated. An application of this is a mobile recharging refueling infrastructure based on fuel status and fuel depletion rate rules in regards to route information user profiles and overall vehicle performance. Such a system can be used to create a real time fuel management system that supports both individual vehicles and fleets of vehicles and provide a use case where the driver and vehicle will not ever be stranded.

The foregoing embodiments of the invention are examples and can be varied in many ways. Such present or future variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and all such modifications as are obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
