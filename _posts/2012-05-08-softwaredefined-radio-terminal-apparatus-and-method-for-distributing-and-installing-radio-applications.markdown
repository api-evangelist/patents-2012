Hereinafter preferred embodiments according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Referring to and the procedure of distribution and execution of the radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention may comprise three steps a design step S an installation step S and an execution step S .

The design step S is a step of producing the radio application. In the design step a supplier of the radio application may generate a radio application package including radio controller codes and user defined codes for implementing the radio application by using a standard baseband application programming interface API header defining a standard baseband interface.

At this time the radio controller codes may be included in the radio application package in executable code form through a compiler . Also as shown in in a case that the user defined codes are distributed in source code form the user defined codes may be distributed in encrypted source code form through an encryption procedure performed by an encoder . If the user defined codes are distributed in source code form the user defined codes may be compiled in a terminal which will execute the user defined codes and thereby device independency of the user defined codes may be achieved.

Meanwhile as shown in when the user defined codes may be distributed in executable codes which can be directly executed in terminal one of various compilers may compile the user defined codes into executable codes suitable for an execution environment of the terminal and make the executable codes being included in the application package .

The radio application package generated according to the above described procedure may be uploaded to a distribution sever and then downloaded to a terminal desiring to use the corresponding radio application.

The installation step S is a step of downloading the radio application package stored in the distribution server and installing the radio application by using the downloaded radio application package . At this time the user defined codes the radio controller codes and the pipeline configuration metadata included in the radio application package may be installed in an application processor layer or a baseband processor layer .

Here as shown in if the user defined codes are in source code form the user defined codes may be complied and generated into at least one executable user defined functional block by a compiler . If the user defined codes are encrypted the user defined codes may be complied after being decoded by a decoder . On the other hand if the user defined codes are in executable code customized for a terminal the compiling shown in is not necessary.

The execution step S is a step of actual execution of the installed radio application and the actual wireless communication may be performed by loading and executing the executable codes installed for processing radio signals through the application processor and the baseband processor based on information within the radio application.

For example when command instructing an execution of the radio application installed in terminal is received a loader may determine which blocks are needed for performing the radio application by referring to the pipeline configuration metadata . Also the radio controller and the user defined functional blocks may be loaded from a storage of terminal. Also the loader may load the radio controller codes to the application processor or the baseband processor and load the user defined functional block and standard functional block into the baseband accelerator by referring to the pipeline configuration metadata .

Referring to a standard baseband interface is an application programming interface API standardizing digital signal processing algorithms needed for baseband domain in modem and the standard interfaces and the standard functional blocks are shown as an example.

As a type of the standard interface the standard interface may include a transformation a channel coding a network mapper an interleaving and a source coding and so on. Also as standard functional blocks for the transformation a spreading a dispreading a scrambling a descrambling a Fast Fourier Transform FFT and an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform IFFT may be defined.

For example Input Out data through the FFT properties of the data and member functions may be defined for the FFT . Also an object oriented design of radio application may be made possible by assigning common properties to functional blocks having the same type.

Meanwhile in the example embodiments of the present invention a standard application programming interface API header file which is written in high level language according to the above described standard baseband interface may be used. Therefore a developer of radio application may develop radio applications by referring to the standard interface API header.

Referring to a software defined radio terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention may comprise a storage configured to store user defined functional block codes a pipeline configuration metadata radio controller codes baseband driver codes and a loader a microprocessor configured to read out a compiler the radio controller codes the baseband driver codes and the loader from the storage and to execute them and a plurality of baseband accelerators .

Hereinafter by referring to the constitution of the software defined radio terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention and relation of connections between the components of the terminal will be explained in detail.

The standard functional blocks the user defined functional blocks the pipeline configuration metadata the compiler the radio controller codes the baseband driver codes and the loader may be stored in the storage . Thus the microprocessor is configured to readout the codes from the storage and execute the codes.

Here the user defined functional blocks the pipeline configuration metadata and the radio controller codes may be downloaded from an application server and installed to the storage .

In this case the downloaded user defined functional blocks may be in source code form in intermediate representation IR form or in executable code form. If the downloaded user defined functional blocks are in source code form the compiler executed in the microprocessor may compile the user defined functional blocks into executable codes for the terminal and store the executable codes in the storage . If the downloaded user defined functional blocks are executable codes already compiled suitable for the terminal the user defined functional blocks may be installed in the storage without any further converting procedures.

Here the storage may be implemented as a Non Volatile memory such as flash memory device or a Volatile memory such as D RAM or S RAM. The storage is a component storing the user defined functional blocks the pipeline configuration metadata the compiler the radio controller codes the baseband driver codes and the loader . Thus the microprocessor is configured to readout the codes to be executed from the storage and execute the codes.

For example volatile memory constituting the storage is a component which may be mapped to a memory space that is an address space of the microprocessor may readout the components to be executed such as those of the radio controller layer and the baseband driver layer from the non volatile memory and store them in it and may make the microprocessor being capable of executing them. Here a layer may mean a set of software modules or a set of functions in an aspect of software.

However a case that non volatile memory is directly mapped to the memory space of the microprocessor is also possible and in this case the microprocessor may execute codes stored in non volatile memory directly on it.

The standard functional blocks may be functional blocks to support standardized signal processing functions such as a DFT a IDFT a FFT a IFFT a channel coding and an interleaving which have been written based on the pre defined standard baseband interface. Therefore the standard functional blocks may be initially installed in the terminal according to the present invention or provided to users through firmware or software upgrade.

The user defined functional blocks may be functional blocks which are provided by supplier of radio application as explained above and are downloaded from the application server and installed to the storage by the user.

The pipeline configuration metadata may be at least one data file in predetermined format which describes connections between functional blocks needed for implementing a radio application desired to be executed and initial values of attributes of each functional block.

On the other hand the user defined functional blocks may include baseband digital signal processing function which is not implemented in the standard functional block. That is the standard functional block may be defined in the standard baseband API header and the supplier of radio application may constitute the user defined functional blocks and the pipeline configuration metadata by referring the standard baseband API header .

The radio controller may be a component performed by reading out radio controller codes installed in the storage and executing the radio controller codes by the microprocessor. The radio controller is executed not in real time and has a role of receiving control commands suitable for radio signal according to each radio application and transferring them to the baseband accelerator by using the standard baseband interface.

Also the radio controller may have a responsibility of interfacing between a user layer and the baseband layer. That is the radio controller receives receive data from the baseband accelerator and transfers the received data to a network stack omitted in and transfers transmit data from the network stack to the baseband accelerator. On the other hand when context information are required to be transferred to upper layer the context information may be transferred from corresponding functional block to the upper layer via the radio controller. Here the upper layer may be a user application.

Here the context information may be transferred by a context information interface and the context information interface may be a predefined interface needed for transferring the context information generated in functional block wanting to transfer context information from the functional block to the upper layer which is used by the radio controller.

The microprocessor may be configured to read out the radio controller codes for transferring control commands controlling the baseband accelerator according to application to be executes from the storage and execute them. Also the codes including the baseband layer may be read out from the storage and executed by the microprocessor . At this time the baseband driver may be configured to take a role of enabling interfacing between the radio controller and the baseband accelerator.

Also the microprocessor may perform reconfiguration of the baseband accelerator by downloading the user defined functional blocks into the baseband accelerator so that various applications can be executed in the terminal of the present invention.

For this as shown in at least one functional block and may be configured to be downloaded to the baseband accelerator from the storage . Here the functional blocks needed for performing algorithm may be allocated in the baseband accelerator via the loader by referring the pipeline configuration metadata .

The loader may be a program which is loaded from the storage and executed by the microprocessor and may be included in the baseband driver according to other example embodiment. That is the loader may load all the standard functional blocks and user defined functional blocks which are specified in the pipeline configuration metadata into the baseband accelerator and make them be executed by the baseband accelerator .

Meanwhile the functional blocks loaded to the baseband accelerator may include a baseband control functional block controlling the baseband accelerator in real time. In this case the loader may configure a pipeline defining an operation sequence of the loaded functional blocks based on the pipeline configuration metadata and transfer configuration information of the pipeline to the baseband control functional block so that the baseband control functional block controls the baseband accelerator according to the transferred pipeline configuration information.

Hereinafter a configuration and a procedure of distributing radio application for a software defined radio terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention will be explained.

Referring to a procedure of distributing a radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention may be configured to include a step of encrypting user defined codes S a step of generating application package S and a step of distributing application package S.

Also the step of generating application package S may include a step of generating and compiling user defined codes S a step of generating and compiling radio controller codes S a step of generating pipeline configuration metadata and a step of generating package S.

Meanwhile referring to the radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention may be generated from an application package including user defined codes radio controller codes pipeline configuration metadata .

Hereinafter referring to and each step of the distribution procedure of radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail.

The step of encrypting user defined codes S is a step of encrypting the user defined codes to be included in a radio application package. The user defined codes may be distributed in source code form in intermediate representation IR form or in executable code form according to selection of radio application provider. In the case that the user defined codes are distributed in source code form it is desirable that the user defined codes are written in standard languages in order to be compiled in various terminals. Meanwhile in the case that the user defined codes are distributed in source code form since source codes of the user defined codes may be exposed the user defined codes may be encrypted before distribution in order to prevent exposure of source codes.

The step of generating application package S is a step of generating a radio application package including radio application to be executed in a software defined radio terminal. The application package may comprise as shown in the user defined codes the radio controller codes and the pipeline configuration metadata .

Here the user defined codes are codes defining functional block needed for implementing a radio application to be executed and the radio controller codes are codes written for controlling functional blocks needed for implementing the radio application to be executed. Also the functional blocks defined by the user defined codes are related to implementations of digital signal processing functions which are not implemented in the standard functional blocks defined in the standard baseband API header .

On the other hand the user defined codes may be constituted as one of codes executable directly in baseband accelerator of the terminal which the application package is installed to codes in source code form which needs to be compiled for execution and executable codes.

Therefore if the user defined codes are in executable code form the user defined codes may be codes compiled by various compilers for various terminals.

In the radio controller codes codes for interfacing with an operation system of the terminal and for controlling functional blocks needed to implement a radio application demanded. The radio controller codes may be codes complied into executable codes by a compiler.

Meanwhile the pipeline configuration metadata may define functional blocks needed for implementing corresponding radio application and connections between the functional blocks. Also the pipeline configuration metadata may include information on connections between the standard functional blocks included in the standard baseband API header and the functional blocks defined by the user defined codes and information on initial configuration values for attributes of each of the functional blocks.

The user defined codes the radio controller codes and the pipeline configuration metadata which have been generated in the above described manner may be uploaded to a server and may be downloaded to the terminal wanting to use the corresponding radio application and installed to the terminal in form of application package .

In the step of distributing application package S the application package which has been in the above described manner may be uploaded to a radio application distribution server and downloaded to a software defined radio terminal wanting the corresponding radio application.

Hereinafter a procedure of installing radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention will be explained.

Referring to the procedure of installing radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention may be configured to include a step of downloading application package S and a step of installing application package S.

Hereinafter referring to each step of the installation procedure of radio application according to an example embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail.

The step of downloading application package S is a step of downloading radio application to be executed in software defined radio terminal from a distribution server. In the step of downloading application package S as shown in the application package comprising the user defined codes the radio controller codes and the pipeline configuration metadata may be downloaded from the distribution server to the software defined radio terminal.

The step of installing application package S is a step of installing the application package downloaded from the distribution server to the terminal as a form executable by the terminal and may include a step of compiling the user defined codes S a step of installing the compiled user defined codes to the storage S and a step of loading the user defined functional blocks S.

The step of compiling the user defined codes S is a step of compiling the user defined codes into codes executable directly in the baseband accelerator of the terminal in the case that the user defined codes included in the downloaded application package are not codes executable directly in the baseband accelerator but source codes and generating the user defined functional blocks. Also if the user defined codes are encrypted the user defined codes are compiled after being decoded in the step S.

Also the step of installing the compiled user defined codes to the storage S is a step of installing the pipeline configuration metadata included in the downloaded application package the user defined functional blocks defined by the user defined codes the radio controller codes and the standard functional block which include standard command instruction codes based on the predefined standard baseband interface to the storage of the terminal.

The step of loading the user defined functional blocks S is a step of loading the user defined functional blocks defined by the user defined functional blocks included in the downloaded radio application package directly to the baseband accelerator . At this time if the user defined codes are codes executable for the baseband accelerator the user defined functional blocks defined by the user defined codes may be loaded to the baseband accelerator directly without the step of compiling user defined codes S.

Referring to a constitution of a pipeline depicting operation procedures of functional blocks is shown when a radio application adopting an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM is implemented in a terminal without a separate voice channel.

In the example of a turbo encoder and a turbo decoder are implemented in the form of user defined functional block other blocks of a transmit pipeline and other blocks of a receive pipeline are implemented in the form of standard functional block.

Meanwhile the transmit pipeline may process data transmitted by a MAC and the receive pipeline may process receive data and transmit the processed data to the MAC . Here the radio controller may take a role of exchanging data between the MAC and the network stack . Also the radio controller may provide interfaces corresponding to control commands of a network manager embedded in an operation system OS and thereby may receive the control commands from the network manager . The network manager may be configured to present context information on radio signals such as transmit receive signal qualities and a signal strength to an user by visualizing them or to transfer control information such as information on access channel and radio signal encryption algorithm selected by the user to the radio controllers so as to perform controlling radio signal according to intention of the user.

Referring to an operation example of radio application implemented in a terminal with a separate voice channel.

Hereinafter an interworking operation between a radio controller and internal functions of a mobile operation system operating in an application processor will be explained by referring to .

Generally in the mobile OS a phone application may perform functions of telephone such as transmitting and receiving voice of short messaging service SMS messages in the terminal. As a usual a call tracking function which tracks call history and notifies it to a user in addition to voice call function a SMS dispatch function of transmitting and receiving SMS messages and a data tracking function of notifying an amount of data transmitted and received may exist within the phone application. These functions of the phone application may be implemented based on a phone library provided by the mobile OS and the phone library may transfer commands related to control on a baseband processor to a radio interface layer RIL layer .

A radio controller may transfer signal for controlling the baseband processor according to a wireless network control signal and a voice control signal of the mobile OS . Also the radio controller may transmit voice data received from the baseband processor to the phone application and receive voice data received from the phone application to the baseband processor when signals transmitted to and received from the baseband processor are voice data. Otherwise the radio controller may transmit data received from the baseband processor to a network stack and receive data received from the network stack to the baseband processor when signals transmitted to and received from the baseband processor are packet data. Thereby voice call function and wireless networking function may be provided to the user of the terminal at the same time.

Also the radio controller may further include some upper layer functions of a MAC according to radio signal supported by a radio application. Referring to by connecting the radio controller and the RIL an application framework and a radio application framework may be configured so that the baseband processor is controlled by the radio controller according to control commands of the RIL .

Accordingly by connecting the radio controller customized and prepared for each radio application and the RIL a phone application independent on the radio application may control the baseband processor dependent on the radio application via the radio controller . Therefore the above described functions of phone application may be performed persistently without any change of the phone application even when the radio application is changed.

Referring to the user defined codes may be written in high level language such as C or C during development of the radio application. Optionally the user defined codes may be converted into encrypted source codes by an encoder .

The encrypted source codes generated in the above described manner may be distributed to each terminal as included in radio application package. In the procedure of installation to the terminal the encrypted source codes may be converted to machine codes executable in a modem hardware embedded in the terminal by a decoder and compilers . Since the compilers are required to generate machine codes optimized for a modem hardware embedded in the terminal the compilers are dependent on the modem hardware. Thus suppliers of modem hardware may produce compilers optimized to their modem hardware and provide them to radio application developers.

Referring to the user defined codes may be written in high level language such as C or C during development of the radio application may be compiled into executable machine codes by one of compilers suitable for corresponding baseband processor. These machine codes may be packaged to respective radio application package for each and the radio application packages may be uploaded to a radio application server. The terminal may download the radio application operable in its baseband processor . Thus suppliers of modem hardware may produce compilers optimized to their modem hardwares and provide them to radio application developers.

Referring to the software defined radio terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention may select one of radio applications supporting such as Long term Evolution LTE Wideband Code Division Multiple Access WCDMA Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX Global System for Mobile Communications GSM and Radio Frequency Identification RFID in the on line store download the selected radio application and operate according to the communication mode of the downloaded radio application independently on the modem chip embedded in the terminal. Also radio applications which can be selected by the terminal may include a radio application making the terminal operate as a walkie talkie a wireless microphone or a wireless phone.

While the example embodiments of the present invention and their advantages have been described in detail it should be understood that various changes substitutions and alterations may be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention.
