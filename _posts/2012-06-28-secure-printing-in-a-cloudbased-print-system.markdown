A cloud printing system may provide users with an ability to print content from virtually any application or device using any cloud aware printer. In other words the cloud printing system may provide an ability for virtually any application running on any device within a network to communicate with a cloud print service to thereby print to any printer that is also in communication with the cloud print service. In one example an application may send a print request over a network to the cloud print server for printing a document using the cloud print service. In return the cloud print server may provide a print dialog including a number of available cloud aware printers as well as printing options associated with each available cloud aware printer. Upon selection of a cloud aware printer and its corresponding printing options the cloud print service may receive over a network a print job including the document subject to the print request in a printer independent format convert the print job to the selected printer specific format and transmit the print job over the network to the cloud aware printer for printing.

Because documents to be printed in the cloud printing system may be up loaded to a server that is remote from the application or are otherwise routed via a public network such as the internet users may be concerned with using a cloud print service for printing confidential documents. However rendering a secure printing mechanism within the cloud printing system presents its own set of challenges that are not encountered in conventional print paradigms.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

The embodiments provide a printing system including an application manager implemented at a cloud print server configured to receive a print job including encrypted content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer over a network from an application associated with a device a print job router implemented at the cloud print server configured to route the print job including the encrypted content over the network to the designated cloud aware printer to be decrypted and a secure format converter configured to receive the print job including decrypted content from the designated cloud aware printer convert the print job from a printer independent format to a printer specific format associated with the designated cloud aware printer and provide the print job having the printer specific format to the designated cloud aware printer for printing.

According to one embodiment the secure format converter may be implemented at the cloud print server. The secure format converter may be configured to receive the print job including the decrypted content over the network from the designated cloud aware printer using a secure connection and the print job router is configured to route the print job having the printer specific format over the network to the designated cloud aware printer using the secure connection. The secure format converter may be configured to perform the format conversion in memory such that the cloud print server does not store information related to the decrypted content.

According to another embodiment the secure format converter may be implemented on a server within a private network associated with the device. The secure format converter may be configured to receive the print job including the decrypted content over the private network from the designated cloud aware printer and the secure format converter may be configured to provide the print job having the printer specific format over the private network to the designated cloud aware printer.

According to another embodiment the secure format converter may be implemented on a server associated with a third party.

The application manager configured to receive a print job including encrypted content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer over a network from an application associated with a device may include the application manager configured to receive a secure print request for content to be printed by the designated cloud aware printer over the network from the application an encryption key manager configured to provide over the network an encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer in response to the secure print request and the application manager configured to receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application. The encrypted content may be encrypted with the encryption key.

The application manager configured to receive the secure print request may include providing over the network a print dialog to a user of the application in response to a print request the print dialog configured to provide one or more cloud aware printers and an encryption option for selection by the user and receiving over the network encryption option information indicating that the encryption option is enabled and printer selection information indicating the designated cloud aware printer.

The embodiments also provide a method for secure printing. The method includes first receiving at a cloud print server a print job including encrypted content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer over a network from an application associated with a device routing by the cloud print server the print job including the encrypted content over the network to the designated cloud aware printer to be decrypted second receiving at a secure format converter the print job including decrypted content from the designated cloud aware printer converting by the secure format converter the print job from a printer independent format to a printer specific format associated with the designated cloud aware printer and providing by the secure format converter the print job having the printer specific format to the designated cloud aware printer for printing.

In one embodiment the secure format converter may be implemented at the cloud print server. The second receiving step may include receiving the print job including the decrypted content over the network from the designated cloud aware printer using a secure connection and the providing step may include routing the print job having the printer specific format over the network to the designated cloud aware printer using the secure connection. The converting step may perform the format conversion in memory such that the cloud print server does not store information related to the decrypted content.

According to another embodiment the secure format converter may be implemented on a server within a private network associated with the device. The second receiving step may include receiving the print job including the decrypted content over the private network from the designated cloud aware printer and the providing step may include routing the print job having the printer specific format over the private network to the designated cloud aware printer.

The first receiving step may include receiving a secure print request for content to be printed by the designated cloud aware printer over the network from the application providing over the network an encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer in response to the secure print request and receiving the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application. The encrypted content may be encrypted with the encryption key.

The receiving the secure print request may include providing over the network a print dialog to a user of the application in response to a print request the print dialog configured to provide one or more cloud aware printers and an encryption option for selection by the user and receiving over the network encryption option information indicating that the encryption option is enabled and printer selection information indicating the designated cloud aware printer.

The embodiments also provide a non transitory computer readable medium storing instructions that when executed cause one or more processors to perform a secure printing process. The instructions comprising instructions to receive at a cloud print server a print job including encrypted content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer over a network from an application associated with a device route by the cloud print server the print job including the encrypted content over the network to the designated cloud aware printer to be decrypted receive at a secure format converter the print job including decrypted content from the designated cloud aware printer convert by the secure format converter the print job from a printer independent format to a printer specific format associated with the designated cloud aware printer and provide by the secure format converter the print job having the printer specific format to the designated cloud aware printer for printing. The secure format converter may be implemented at the cloud print server or on a server within a private network associated with the device.

In a device is illustrated as an example of virtually any computing device from which a user may wish to execute a print job. By way of non limiting example then the device may include a laptop or desktop computer a netbook a tablet computer a smartphone a camera or any device which may store or have access to content which the user may desire to print.

In the example of an operating system is illustrated as executing an application . Again these elements are included by way of illustration and example and may include virtually any operating system or other platform on which virtually any application may run. For example the operating system may include operating systems such as the Windows operating system Mac OS or Linux and may include mobile platforms such as Android Symbian or iPhone OS to name a few examples. In other examples the operating system may include a browser based operating system such as the Chrome OS.

Consequently the application may include virtually any application which may run on any underlying operating system or platform. Examples of such applications are well known and too numerous to mention in any detail but generally include document processing applications email applications image editing or presentation software a web browser or virtually any application which provides the user with a rendering of data content which the user may wish to print.

In particular the application may represent a web application which executes on a remote application server as application . That is the application may include any application functionality which is accessed by the user over the network and experienced locally as the application e.g. using a browser running at the device . As is known such web applications allow an owner of the application server to assume responsibility for installing configuring executing and maintaining the application at the application server so that the user of the device may obtain the benefit of the application without many or any of the associated costs and responsibilities. Techniques for executing such a web application and related technology are well known in the art and are therefore not described further in detail herein except as may be helpful or necessary to understand operations of the system of .

The network may thus represent for example the public Internet or other wide area public or private network. The network may represent in further examples a corporate or other intranet and or a smaller scale local or personal network any of which may be implemented using standard network technology.

Further in a cloud aware printer is illustrated which is configured to communicate with the cloud print service over the network . In this regard the term cloud or cloud aware references the use of cloud computing which generally speaking includes a style of computing in which computing resources such as application programs and file storage are remotely provided over a network such as the Internet typically through a web browser. For example many web browsers are capable of running applications which can themselves be application programming interfaces API s to more sophisticated applications running on remote servers. In the cloud computing paradigm a web browser interfaces with and controls an application program that is running on a remote server. Through the browser the user can create edit save and delete files on the remote server via the remote application program. Thus it may be observed that the application server and associated application may also represent examples of cloud computing. Although only one cloud aware printer is illustrated in the example embodiments encompass any number of cloud aware printers using the system of .

In the context of the cloud aware printer the cloud print service enables the application to print directly to the cloud aware printer without a requirement or need for e.g. independently of involvement of the operating system . In other words the application may communicate directly with the cloud print service to thereby print to the cloud aware printer without e.g. requiring a local driver within the operating system . As a result virtually any application that may be configured to communicate with the cloud print service may make use of the cloud aware printer as described in detail below.

For example the cloud print service may be configured to register the user and or the device as well as the cloud aware printer or any other printer capable of using the system of . In a specific example the device may be a smartphone and the user may use the application to purchase a ticket e.g. a movie ticket or an airline ticket . Then the user may print the purchased ticket directly to the cloud aware printer even though the device and or the operating system may not have the resources or otherwise be configured to support native printing in a conventional sense e.g. may not currently be executing a print driver of any sort associated with the cloud aware printer . In this way the user of the application may be provided with a print option and associated abilities that are not currently provided in conventional printing paradigms and techniques. Many other such examples are described herein or would be apparent.

The cloud aware printer may be contrasted with a legacy printer not specifically illustrated in which does not natively support communication with the cloud print service . When using such a legacy printer a separate device and or software may be utilized to impart the advantages of the cloud print service to the legacy printer. It will be appreciated that all the various features and functions of the cloud aware printer may be obtained through the use of a legacy printer supplemented with appropriate hardware software support.

In short the system provides an ability for virtually any application running on any device within the network e.g. the applications and device to communicate with the cloud print service to thereby print to any printer which is also in direct or indirect communication with the cloud print service . Consequently users may benefit from increased printing options and abilities and experience an overall decrease in the costs and efforts associated with doing so. Meanwhile printer manufacturers may experience a decreased or eliminated need to provide users with the updated driver s and other prerequisites for users to fully experience the benefits of their products. This may result in for example higher customer satisfaction and a decreased cost of producing and maintaining printers. In particular as referenced above the system may provide a number of enhanced features and functions related to the secure printing of documents using the cloud print service .

In one embodiment the cloud print server may use a public key cryptography mechanism e.g. public private key pair . For example the cloud print server may manage a plurality of public encryption keys corresponding to the registered cloud aware printers and when the cloud print server receives a secure printing request designating a cloud aware printer e.g. the cloud aware printer from the application the cloud print server may provide over the network the public encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer . Then the content to be printed may be encrypted using the encryption key and the encrypted content may be uploaded to the cloud print server . For example the cloud print server may receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network and then route the print job including the encrypted content to the designated cloud aware printer . The designated cloud aware printer may decrypt the content using the corresponding private key stored on the designated cloud aware printer . However besides public key cryptography the embodiments encompass any type of encryption decryption mechanism such as a user defined password mechanism. For example instead of encrypting the content using the received public encryption key the content may be encrypted using a password that has been provided by the user of the application. Then the designated cloud aware printer may decrypt the content when the password is entered correctly by the user on an interface of the designated cloud aware printer . However the embodiments encompass any type of encryption deception mechanism known in the art.

Also because the cloud print server receives the print job in a printer independent format the cloud print server or a server separate from the cloud print server may provide a mechanism that converts the print job from the printer independent format to a printer specific format. For example after the designated cloud aware printer has decrypted the content e.g. using the private encryption key the user defined password or any other method a secure format converter may convert the print job from the printer independent format to the printer specific format and provide the converted print job back to the designated cloud aware printer in order to carryout the printing operation. In one embodiment the secure format converter may be associated with the cloud print service e.g. shown in or the secure format converter may be associated with a private network e.g. shown in .

Referring to the application may provide a print dialog in conjunction with the cloud print service . The print dialog includes a printer list A identifying a number of printers including the cloud aware printer the legacy printer as well as any other available cloud aware printer that is associated with a user account. For example the printer list A may include the entire list of printers associated with the user account of the user for cloud printing. For example the entire list of printers includes the cloud aware printer and or the legacy printer as well as other cloud aware printers and or legacy printers that are associated with the cloud print service . In one example the entire list of printers include the printers that are registered with the cloud print service for a particular user as well as publically available printers that have registered with the cloud print service . The publically available printers may include printers that located at a business e.g. coffee shops printing centers etc. that may charge a fee for printing. As referenced throughout this disclosure the term cloud aware printer encompasses the cloud aware printer and any type of printer that includes cloud capabilities such as the cloud enabled legacy printer and the publically available printers.

Further the print dialog may include one or more printing options B corresponding to each of the printers in the printer list A and an encryption option C. For example the user may designate one of the cloud aware printers in the printer list A and if the user wishes to print using a secure printing mechanism the user may select the encryption option C. The encryption option C may be any type of selectable printing option such as a check box or radio buttons for example. In response to the printer selection and the encryption option selection the application may receive a public encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer over the network from the cloud print service . Then the content may be encrypted using the public encryption key. For example the application may include an encryption unit that is configured to encrypt the content using the encryption key received from the cloud print service . In another embodiment instead of using the public encryption key provided by the cloud print service the encryption unit may encrypt the content using a password defined by the user. For example the encryption unit may encrypt the content using the user defined password provided through the encryption option C e.g. the encryption option C may include a portion that allows a user to enter a password . However the encryption unit may encrypt the content via any type of encryption mechanism known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

Referring to the cloud print server may include a number of example components or modules which may be utilized to implement functionalities of the cloud print service and in particular may be utilized to implement the concepts and features related to the secure printing mechanisms. For example the cloud print service may include a registration manager which may be configured to register printers and users. The registration manager may be configured to receive a registration of the cloud aware printer and or the legacy printer including storing identification information therefore within a data store of registered printers. Also the registration manager may receive the public encryption keys from the cloud aware printers when the printers register with the cloud print service . Further the registration manager may be configured to register a user s who may currently or potentially wish to execute print jobs using the cloud print service and to store identification information for such users within a data store of registered users.

There are many examples scenarios and techniques by which users and or printers may come to be registered with the cloud print server though the registration manager . In general for example a user of the device may use a browser to visit a website associated with the cloud print service and may enter a username password combination to establish a user account with the cloud print service . In some examples users already may have a user account with a separate and possibly related service or service provider. For example various online services e.g. other cloud based computing resources may provide functionalities such as email data storage and document processing and in such cases the user may already have a secure user account established in connection therewith. In such cases the cloud print service may leverage or access such existing user accounts e.g. to avoid a need to create a new user account and to facilitate access of existing users of other services with the cloud print service such as e.g. for implementation of the printer sharing techniques just described.

It may be appreciated that although the registration manager is illustrated as being included within the cloud print service it also may occur that some or all functionality related to the registration manager may exist externally to the cloud print service . For example the application server may provide an email application as the application and a user of the device may be registered with this email application service . In such a case the application server may have the responsibility of maintaining the user s account and the cloud print service may simply interface with the application server and provide access to the user once the user is logged on into the application .

According to the embodiments the cloud print service may include a key manager and an encryption key database that stores public encryption keys corresponding to the registered printers . For example when the printers register with the cloud print service via the registration manager the registration manager may also receive the corresponding public encryption keys. The registration manager may store the public encryption keys in the encryption key database .

Further in an application manager may be configured to communicate with any application which may be desired to be used for printing within the system of including e.g. the application and the application . Thus for example the application manager may implement various application programming interfaces APIs which enable such communication with external applications. For example the application manager may include a print dialog API which may be configured to render the print dialog including the printer list A the printing options B and the encryption option C. A job submit API may be utilized to receive the identification of application content e.g. the encrypted content the selected printer and printing options submitted by the user by way of the print dialog . The application manager may receive the print job in a format that is independent of a specific printer e.g. generic with respect to all available or relevant printers within the system.

As indicated above the application manager may receive a print request over the network from a user of the application and provide the print dialog over the network to the user. The print dialog includes the printer list A the printing options B and the encryption option C. In response the user may designate a cloud aware printer such as the cloud aware printer and select the encryption option C so that the content can be encrypted. Then the application manager may receive over the network encryption option information indicating that the encryption option C is enabled and printer selection information indicating the designated cloud aware printer . The key manager may provide over the network an encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer . For example the key manager may select the appropriate encryption key from the encryption key database corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer and transmit the encryption key over the network to the application . The encryption unit may encrypt the content to be printed using the encryption key according to methods that are well known in the art. The application manager may then receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application and the print job may be in a format independent of a particular printer.

The print jobs received at the application manager may be passed to a job storage which may provide one or more types of data storage related to operations of the cloud print service . For example the job storage may store print jobs and related information where such print jobs information may be stored prior to transmission to the designated printer. For example a print job may be stored in a printer independent format in which the print job may have been received by the job submit API . Also because the content is encrypted the cloud print service cannot obtain the details regarding the document to be printed.

According to the embodiments a print job router may be configured to route the print job including the encrypted content from the application manager or the job storage to a designated printer e.g. the cloud aware printer . The print job router may further be configured to monitor and mediate execution and success failure of a given print job. The print job router may thus be responsible for managing and monitoring ongoing print jobs from a plurality of users which may be designated for a corresponding plurality of printers including the cloud aware printer .

As shown the print job router may include or otherwise be associated with a job fetch API and or a job control API . For example the job fetch API may be configured to provide the print job to the cloud aware printer e.g. may be used by the cloud aware printer to fetch a desired print job. The job control API may be responsible for authorizing the cloud aware printer as needed and for receiving updated status information from the cloud aware printer e.g. whether the print job has completed or failed. Such status information also may be stored using the job storage in association with the corresponding print job in question. The job control API also may include status information including e.g. whether a print job is currently queued by not yet downloaded to a corresponding printer or spooled downloaded and added to a native printer queue of the cloud aware printer if applicable .

After the cloud aware printer has received the print job including the encrypted content the cloud aware printer may decrypt the content. For example a decryption unit may retrieve its corresponding private encryption key and decrypt the content using the private encryption key. Alternatively a user may enter the user defined password on a user input and the decryption unit may decrypt the content using the user defined password. However the decryption unit may decrypt the content according to any type of decryption mechanism known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The other components of the cloud aware printer are further described later in the disclosure.

After the decryption unit has decrypted the content the print job including the decrypted content may be routed back to the cloud print server in order to convert the print job from the printer independent format to a printer specific format corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer . For example the cloud print service may include a secure format converter which may be configured to receive the print job including the decrypted content over a secure connection and facilitate or execute conversion of the print job into a format associated with the designated type of printer for the print job in question. Such conversion may thus generally include as needed conversion of the print data itself as well as conversion of the print characteristics specified in conjunction with the given print job as further explained below. Also the secure format converter is configured to perform the format conversion in memory such that the cloud print server does not store information related to the decrypted content.

In more detail as is known printers generally require low level device or type specific instructions which provide a base by which printers actually apply ink to paper to achieve a desired appearance. Such instructions may therefore include very specific portrayals of the desired print outcome using e.g. a page description language PDL . For example the language postscript may be used to describe a desired print outcome which may then be rendered e.g. or rasterized by a specific printer using a print text or images. Additionally fixed layout document formats exist which are designed to facilitate device independent printing all maintaining documents available. For example the portable document format PDF is an example of such format where .PDF documents may be generated using postscript. Somewhat similarly the XPS format provides such a fixed layout document which is based on the eXtensible markup language XML .

Thus the encrypted content or other print data may be received from the application in virtually any format including e.g. hypertext markup language HTML or in the format associated with document processing applications and or images or any of the formats referenced above. Further after the decryption unit has decrypted the content the print job is still in the printer independent format. The secure format converter may thus be configured to receive print data in these and any other various formats and to convert the print data into a format that is recognizable by a designated printer. Also the secure format converter receives the print job including the decrypted content over the network from the cloud aware printer via a secure connection line so that the conditional nature of the content is not comprised.

As referenced above the secure format converter may be configured to convert the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer . That is as referenced above the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed i.e. based on preferences of the user and or capabilities or lack thereof of the designated printer. The secure format converter may thus provide appropriate conversion depending on a selected printer and or on preferences of the user. The secure format converter may then provide and execute a resulting converted print job using e.g. a protocol referred to herein as the cloud print protocol CPP . Thus the cloud print protocol allows the cloud print service to communicate with the cloud aware printer or with a legacy printer enabled to communicate with the cloud print service .

Then the secure format converter is configured to provide the converted print job back to the cloud aware printer so that the cloud aware printer may execute the print job. The cloud aware printer may utilize various hardware software components during normal printing operations. For example during execution the print job router may be configured to communicate with e.g. a print client executing on firmware of the cloud aware printer . The print client may communicate with the cloud print service e.g. with the print job router using the cloud print protocol referenced herein.

More specifically the print client may be configured to register the cloud aware printer with the cloud print service and to thereby associate the thus registered printer with a user of the device . Also the print client may provide its public encryption key via the registration manager for storage in the encryption key database when registering with the cloud print service . Moreover the print client may be configured to actually drive the cloud aware printer and thereby execute the desired printing according to the converted print job.

In the example of the cloud aware printer is illustrated as including the print client within the firmware . The firmware as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art may represent factory installed hardware and or software which provides designated functions without generally requiring or allowing user modification or configuration e.g. may utilize read only memory . Thus the cloud aware printer may be preconfigured from before time of purchase to communicate and coordinate with the cloud print service to thereby provide a convenient and enjoyable user experience.

For example the cloud aware printer may include a network access manager the user input and a display or other user output which may generally represent otherwise conventional components that are therefore not described here in detail except as may be needed to assist in understanding example operations of the system. Of course the cloud aware printer need not include all of the components and or may include additional or alternative components which are also not discussed here in detail.

In the example of the network access manager may represent associated hardware software which enables a cloud aware printer to communicate over the network with the cloud print service . For example such communication may be conducted wirelessly if the cloud aware printer is within range of an appropriate wireless network. In other examples the network access manager may enable a wired connection of the cloud aware printer to the network e.g. by way of connection to an appropriate router.

The user input may represent virtually any sort of keypad stylus or other input technique for entering data to the cloud aware printer including the user defined password. Similarly the display may represent virtually any sort of audio and or video display to output information to the user or other user of the cloud aware printer .

It will be appreciated that many other configurations of the cloud aware printer or other printers are contemplated for use in conjunction with the system. For example as referenced above a legacy printer not specifically illustrated in the example of may lack some of the functionality of the cloud aware printer . For example such a legacy printer may not have the network access manager and or the firmware which may be utilized to implement the print client and otherwise communicate with the cloud print service . In such cases the print client may be configured to execute on or in conjunction with a computing device which is in communication with the legacy printer and which has the available resources necessary to implement the functionalities described herein and which may include an otherwise conventional printer driver communicating with the legacy printer in question. Other variations and implementations of the printer or related printers would be apparent and are not described here in detail except as may be necessary or helpful in understanding operations of the roving printer scenarios described herein.

In this example after the decryption unit has decrypted the content the print job including the decrypted content may be provided to the secure format converter located in the same secure network. For example the secure format converter of may receive the print job including the decrypted content over the private network from the cloud aware printer . The secure format converter is configured to convert the print job from the printer independent format to the printer specific format associated with the cloud aware printer in the same manner as previously described with reference to . Then the secure format converter is configured to provide the print job having the printer specific format over the private network to the designated cloud aware printer .

In addition according to another embodiment the secure format converter may be hosted by a server associated with a trusted third party company and accessed using a secure connection. For example a small business who host all emails and documents at a third party company may use the secure format converter provided by the same company. In particular after the decryption unit has decrypted the content the print job including the decrypted content may be provided to the secure format converter located at the server of the third party company. For example the secure format converter may receive the print job including the decrypted content over the network via a secure connection from the cloud aware printer . The secure format converter is configured to convert the print job from the printer independent format to the printer specific format associated with the cloud aware printer in the same manner as previously described with reference to . Then the secure format converter is configured to provide the print job having the printer specific format over the network via the secure connection to the designated cloud aware printer .

A secure print request for content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer may be received over a network from an application associated with a device . For example the application manager may receive a secure print request for content to be printed by the designated cloud aware printer over the network from the application associated with the device . In more detail the application manager may receive a print request over the network from a user of the application and provide the print dialog over the network to the user. The print dialog includes the printer list A the printing options B and the encryption option C. In response the user may designate a cloud aware printer such as the cloud aware printer and select the encryption option C so that the content can be encrypted. Then the application manager may receive over the network encryption option information indicating that the encryption option C is enabled and printer selection information indicating the designated cloud aware printer .

An encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer may be provided over the network in response to the secure print request . For example the key manager may provide over the network an encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer . In particular the key manager may select the appropriate encryption key from the encryption key database corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer and transmit the encryption key over the network to the application . Then the encryption unit may encrypt the content to be printed using the encryption key according to methods that are well known in the art.

A print job including encrypted content may be received over the network from the application . For example the application manager may receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application . The print job including the encrypted content may be routed over the network to the designated cloud aware printer to be decrypted and printed . For example the print job router may be configured to route the print job including the encrypted content to a designated printer e.g. the cloud aware printer .

A print job including encrypted content to be printed by a designated cloud aware printer may be received over a network from an application associated with a device . For example the application manager may receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application . In more detail the application manager may receive a print request over the network from a user of the application and provide the print dialog over the network to the user. The print dialog includes the printer list A the printing options B and the encryption option C. In response the user may designate a cloud aware printer such as the cloud aware printer and select the encryption option C so that the content can be encrypted. Then the application manager may receive over the network encryption option information indicating that the encryption option C is enabled and printer selection information indicating the designated cloud aware printer . Then the key manager may provide over the network an encryption key corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer . The encryption unit may encrypt the content to be printed using the encryption key according to methods that are well known in the art. Alternatively instead of using the encryption key the encryption unit may encrypt the content using the user defined password as explained above or any other type of encryption mechanism. Then the application manager may receive the print job including the encrypted content over the network from the application .

The print job including the encrypted content may be routed over the network to the designated cloud aware printer to be decrypted . For example the print job router may be configured to route the print job including the encrypted content to a designated printer e.g. the cloud aware printer . After the cloud aware printer has received the print job including the encrypted content the cloud aware printer may decrypt the content. For example the decryption unit may retrieve its corresponding private encryption key and decrypt the content using the private encryption key. Alternatively a user may enter the user defined password on a user input and the decryption unit may decrypt the content using the user defined password. However the decryption unit may decrypt the content according to any type of decryption mechanism known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The print job including the decrypted content may be received from the designated cloud aware printer . In one embodiment the print job including the decrypted content may be routed back to the cloud print server in order to convert the print job from the printer independent format to a printer specific format corresponding to the designated cloud aware printer as shown in . For example the cloud print service may include the secure format converter which may be configured to receive the print job including the decrypted content over the secure connection. In another embodiment with respect to the secure format converter may be implemented on a server within a private network associated with the device . The secure format converter may not be connected to or otherwise associated with the cloud print service . For example the secure format converter of may receive the print job including the decrypted content over the private network from the cloud aware printer .

The print job may be converted from a printer independent format to a printer specific format associated with the designated cloud aware printer . For example the secure format convertor of or may convert the printer independent format to the printer specific format associated with the designated cloud aware printer e.g. the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer . That is as referenced above the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed i.e. based on preferences of the user and or capabilities or lack thereof of the designated printer. The secure format converter may thus provide appropriate conversion depending on a selected printer and or on preferences of the user. Also the secure format converter may be configured to perform the format conversion in memory such that the cloud print server does not store information related to the decrypted content.

The print job having the printer specific format may be provided to the designated cloud aware printer for printing . In one embodiment the secure format converter is configured to provide over the network the converted print job back to the cloud aware printer so that the cloud aware printer may execute the print job as shown in . In another embodiment the secure format converter is configured to provide the print job having the printer specific format over the private network to the designated cloud aware printer so that the cloud aware printer may execute the print job as shown in .
