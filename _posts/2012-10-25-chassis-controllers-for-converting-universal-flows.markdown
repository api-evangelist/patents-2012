Many current enterprises have large and sophisticated networks comprising switches hubs routers servers workstations and other networked devices which support a variety of connections applications and systems. The increased sophistication of computer networking including virtual machine migration dynamic workloads multi tenancy and customer specific quality of service and security configurations require a better paradigm for network control. Networks have traditionally been managed through low level configuration of individual components. Network configurations often depend on the underlying network for example blocking a user s access with an access control list ACL entry requires knowing the user s current IP address. More complicated tasks require more extensive network knowledge forcing guest users port 80 traffic to traverse an HTTP proxy requires knowing the current network topology and the location of each guest. This process is of increased difficulty where the network switching elements are shared across multiple users.

In response there is a growing movement driven by both industry and academia towards a new network control paradigm called Software Defined Networking SDN . In the SDN paradigm a network controller running on one or more servers in a network controls maintains and implements control logic that governs the forwarding behavior of shared network switching elements on a per user basis. Making network management decisions often requires knowledge of the network state. To facilitate management decision making the network controller creates and maintains a view of the network state and provides an application programming interface upon which management applications may access a view of the network state.

Some of the primary goals of maintaining large networks including both datacenters and enterprise networks are scalability mobility and multi tenancy. Many approaches taken to address one of these goals results in hampering at least one of the others. For instance one can easily provide network mobility for virtual machines within a layer 2 L2 domain but L2 domains cannot scale to large sizes. Furthermore retaining user isolation greatly complicates mobility. As such improved solutions that can satisfy the scalability mobility and multi tenancy goals are needed.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a network control system that allows several different logical datapath LDP sets to be specified for several different users through one or more shared forwarding elements without allowing the different users to control or even view each other s forwarding logic. These shared forwarding elements are referred to below as managed switching elements or managed forwarding elements as they are managed by the network control system in order to implement the LDP sets.

In some embodiments the network control system includes one or more controllers also called controller instances below that allow the system to accept LDP sets from users and to configure the switching elements to implement these LDP sets. These controllers allow the system to virtualize control of the shared switching elements and the logical networks that are defined by the connections between these shared switching elements in a manner that prevents the different users from viewing or controlling each other s LDP sets and logical networks while sharing the same switching elements.

In some embodiments each controller instance is a device e.g. a general purpose computer that executes one or more modules that transform the user input from a logical control plane LCP data to a logical forwarding plane LFP data and then transform the logical forwarding plane data to physical control plane data. These modules in some embodiments include a control module and a virtualization module. A control module allows a user to specify and populate a logical datapath set LDPS while a virtualization module implements the specified LDPS by mapping the LDPS onto the physical switching infrastructure. In some embodiments the control and virtualization modules are two separate applications while in other embodiments they are part of the same application.

In some of the embodiments the control module of a controller receives from a user or another source LCP data e.g. data that describes the connections associated with a logical switching element that describes a LDPS. The control module then converts this data to LFP data that is then supplied to the virtualization module. The virtualization module then generates the physical control plane data from the LFP data. The physical control plane data is propagated to the managed switching elements. In some embodiments the control and virtualization modules use an nLog engine to generate LFP data from LCP data and physical control plane data from the LFP data.

The network control system of some embodiments uses different controllers to perform different tasks. For instance in some embodiments the network control system uses three types of controllers. The first controller type is an application protocol interface API controller. API controllers are responsible for receiving configuration data and user queries from a user through API calls and responding to the user queries. The API controllers also disseminate the received configuration data to the other controllers. As such the API controllers of some embodiments serve as the interface between users and the network control system. In some embodiments a second type of controller is a logical controller which is responsible for implementing LDP sets by computing universal flow entries that are generic expressions of flow entries for the managed switching element that realize the LDP sets. A logical controller in some embodiments does not interact directly with the physical switching elements but pushes the universal flow entries to a third type of controller a physical controller.

Physical controllers in different embodiments have different responsibilities. In some embodiments the physical controllers generate customized flow entries from the universal flow entries and push these customized flow entries down to the managed switching elements. In some such embodiments several physical controllers generate customized flow entries for some managed switching elements while directing other physical controllers to generate such flow entries for other managed switching elements. In yet other embodiments physical controllers relay universal flows to the managed switching elements that the physical controllers are responsible for managing so that the managed switching elements customize the flow entries.

Depending on the size of the deployment managed by a controller cluster i.e. several controllers any number of each of the three types of controller may exist within the cluster. In some embodiments a leader controller has the responsibility of partitioning the load over all the controllers and effectively assigning a list of LDP sets for each logical controller to manage and a list of physical switching elements for each physical controller to manage. In some embodiments the API responsibilities are executed at each controller in the cluster. However similar to the logical and physical responsibilities some embodiments only run the API responsibilities on a subset of controllers. This subset in some such embodiments only performs API processing which results in better isolation between the API operations and the rest of the system.

In some embodiments one of the software tools that allows the system to virtualize control of a set of switching elements i.e. to allow several users to share the same switching elements without viewing or controlling each other s LDP sets is an intermediate data storage structure that 1 stores the state of the network 2 receives and records modifications to different parts of the network from different users and 3 in some embodiments provides different views of the state of the network to different users. For instance in some embodiments the intermediate data storage structure is a network information base NIB data structure that stores the state of the network that is defined by one or more switching elements. The system uses this NIB data structure as an intermediate storage structure for reading the state of the network and writing modifications to the state of the network. In some embodiments the NIB also stores the logical configuration and the logical state for each user specified LDPS. In these embodiments the information in the NIB that represents the state of the actual switching elements accounts for only a subset of the total information stored in the NIB.

In some embodiments the system has 1 a network operating system NOS to create and maintain the NIB storage structure and 2 one or more applications that run on top of the NOS to specify logic for reading values from and writing values to the NIB. When the NIB is modified in order to effectuate a change in the switching logic of a switching element the NOS of some embodiments also propagates the modification to the switching element.

The system of different embodiments uses the NIB differently to virtualize access to the shared switching elements and network. In some embodiments the system provides different views of the NIB to different users in order to ensure that different users do not have direct view and control over each other s switching logic. For instance in some embodiments the NIB is a hierarchical data structure that represents different attributes of different switching elements as elements e.g. different nodes in a hierarchy. The NIB in some of these embodiments is a multi layer hierarchical data structure with each layer having a hierarchical structure and one or more elements e.g. nodes on each layer linked to one or more elements e.g. nodes on another layer. In some embodiments the lowest layer elements correspond to the actual switching elements and their attributes while each of the higher layer elements serve as abstractions of the actual switching elements and their attributes. As further described below some of these higher layer elements are used in some embodiments to show different abstract switching elements and or switching element attributes to different users in a network control system.

In some embodiments another level of controller runs within the managed switching elements or adjacent to the managed switching elements in order to minimize the computational load on the physical controller. This other level of controller is referred to as the chassis controller. In these embodiments the physical controllers supply the universal flow entries to the chassis controller and this controller performs the computation to generate the customized physical control plane CPCP data. In these embodiments the physical controllers primarily act as a relay between the logical controllers and the chassis controller to direct the universal flow entries to the correct chassis controller for the correct managed switching elements. In several embodiments described below the chassis controllers are shown to be outside of the managed switching elements. Also in several of these embodiments the chassis controllers operate on the same host machine e.g. same computer on which the managed software switching element executes.

When placing the chassis controllers within or adjacent to the switching elements is not possible the physical controllers in some embodiments continue to perform the computation to translate universal flow information to physical flow information and send the physical flow information using OpenFlow and configuration protocols to the switching elements in which the chassis controllers are not available. For instance some hardware switching elements may not have the capability to run a controller. Another alternative described below is the use of daemons to generate CPCP data from UPCP data when the physical controller does not perform such customization and no chassis controller is available for a particular managed switching element.

The preceding Summary is intended to serve as a brief introduction to some embodiments of the invention. It is not meant to be an introduction or overview of all inventive subject matter disclosed in this document. The Detailed Description that follows and the Drawings that are referred to in the Detailed Description will further describe the embodiments described in the Summary as well as other embodiments. Accordingly to understand all the embodiments described by this document a full review of the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawings is needed. Moreover the claimed subject matters are not to be limited by the illustrative details in the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawing but rather are to be defined by the appended claims because the claimed subject matters can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the subject matters.

In the following detailed description of the invention numerous details examples and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.

Some of the embodiments described below are implemented in a novel network control system that is formed by one or more controllers controller instances for managing several managed switching elements. In some embodiments the control application of a controller receives logical control plane LCP data e.g. network control plane and converts this data to LFP data that is then supplied to the virtualization application. The virtualization application then generates the physical control plane data from the LFP data. The physical control plane data is propagated to the managed switching elements.

In some embodiments the controller instance uses a network information base NIB data structure to send the physical control plane data to the managed switching elements. A controller instance of some embodiments uses an nLog engine to generate LFP data from LCP data and physical control plane data from the LFP data. The controller instances of some embodiments communicate with each other to exchange the generated logical and physical data. In some embodiments the NIB data structure may serve as a communication medium between different controller instances.

Several examples of such systems are described below in Section I. Section II then describes the software architecture of a NOS instance. Section III describes generation and customization of universal flows. Finally Section IV describes the computer systems and processes used to implement some embodiments of the invention.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a method that allows several different logical datapath LDP sets to be specified for several different users through one or more shared switching elements without allowing the different users to control or even view each other s switching logic. In some embodiments the method provides a set of software tools that allows the system to accept LDP sets from users and to configure the switching elements to implement these LDP sets. These software tools allow the method to virtualize control of the shared switching elements and the network that is defined by the connections between these shared switching elements in a manner that prevents the different users from viewing or controlling each other s LDP sets while sharing the same switching elements.

In some embodiments one of the software tools that the method provides that allows it to virtualize control of a set of switching elements i.e. to enable the method to allow several users to share the same switching elements without viewing or controlling each other s LDP sets is an intermediate data storage structure that 1 stores the state of the network 2 receives modifications to different parts of the network from different users and 3 in some embodiments provide different views of the state of the network to different users. For instance in some embodiments the intermediate data storage structure is a network information base NIB data structure that stores the state of the network that is defined by one or more switching elements. In some embodiments the NIB also stores the logical configuration and the logical state for each user specified LDPS. In these embodiments the information in the NIB that represents the state of the actual switching elements accounts for only a subset of the total information stored in the NIB.

The method of some embodiments uses the NIB data structure to read the state of the network and to write modifications to the state of the network. When the data structure is modified in order to effectuate a change in the switching logic of a switching element the method propagates the modification to the switching element.

In some embodiments the method is employed by a virtualized network control system that 1 allows user to specify different LDP sets 2 maps these LDP sets to a set of switching elements managed by the control system. In some embodiments the network infrastructure switching elements includes virtual or physical network switches software switches e.g. Open vSwitch routers for L3 routing and or other switching devices as well as any other network elements such as load balancers etc. that establish connections between these switches routers and or other switching devices. Such switching elements e.g. physical switching elements such as physical switches or routers are implemented as software switches in some embodiments. Software switches are switches that are implemented by storing the switching tables in the memory of a standalone computer instead of an off the shelf switch. In some embodiments the standalone computer may also be executing a hypervisor and one or more virtual machines on top of that hypervisor

These switches are referred to below as managed switching elements or managed forwarding elements as they are managed by the network control system in order to implement the LDP sets. In some embodiments the control system manages these switching elements by pushing physical control plane data to them as further described below. Switching elements generally receive data e.g. a data packet and perform one or more processing operations on the data such as dropping a received data packet passing a packet that is received from one source device to another destination device processing the packet and then passing it a destination device etc. In some embodiments the physical control plane data that is pushed to a switching element is converted by the switching element e.g. by a general purpose processor of the switching element to physical forwarding plane data that specify how the switching element e.g. how a specialized switching circuit of the switching element processes data packets that it receives.

The network control system of some embodiments includes 1 a network operating system NOS that creates and maintains the NIB storage structure and 2 one or more applications that run on top of the NOS to specify control logic for reading values from and writing values to the NIB. The NIB of some of these embodiments serves as a communication channel between the different controller instances and in some embodiments a communication channel between different processing layers of a controller instance.

As shown in the system includes one or more switching elements a network operating system a network information base and one or more applications . The switching elements include N switching devices where N is a number equal to 1 or greater that form the network infrastructure switching elements of the system . In some embodiments the network infrastructure switching elements includes virtual or physical network switches software switches e.g. Open vSwitch routers for layer 3 routing and or other switching devices as well as any other network elements such as middleboxes etc. that establish connections between these switches routers and or other switching devices. All such network infrastructure switching elements are referred to below as switching elements or forwarding elements.

The virtual or physical switching devices typically include control switching logic and forwarding switching logic . In some embodiments a switch s control logic specifies 1 the rules that are to be applied to incoming packets 2 the packets that will be discarded and 3 the packet processing methods that will be applied to incoming packets. The virtual or physical switching elements use the control logic to populate tables governing the forwarding logic . The forwarding logic performs lookup operations on incoming packets and forwards the incoming packets to destination addresses.

As further shown in the system includes one or more applications through which switching logic i.e. sets of logical datapaths is specified for one or more users e.g. by one or more administrators or users . The network operating system NOS serves as a communication interface between 1 the switching elements that perform the physical switching for any one user and 2 the applications that are used to specify switching logic for the users. In this manner the application logic determines the desired network behavior while the NOS merely provides the primitives needed to access the appropriate network state. In some embodiments the NOS provides a set of Application Programming Interfaces API that provides the applications programmatic access to the network switching elements e.g. access to read and write the configuration of network switching elements . In some embodiments this API set is data centric and is designed around a view of the switching infrastructure allowing control applications to read and write state to any element in the network.

To provide the applications programmatic access to the switching elements the NOS needs to be able to control the switching elements itself. The NOS uses different techniques in different embodiments to control the switching elements. In some embodiments the NOS can specify both control and forwarding switching logic and of the switching elements. In other embodiments the NOS controls only the control switching logic of the switching elements as shown in . In some of these embodiments the NOS manages the control switching logic of a switching element through a commonly known switch access interface that specifies a set of APIs for allowing an external application such as a network operating system to control the control plane functionality of a switching element. Two examples of such known switch access interfaces are the OpenFlow interface and the Open Virtual Switch OVS interface which are respectively described in the following two papers McKeown N. 2008 . which can be retrieved from http www.openflowswitch.org documents openflow wp latest.pdf and Pettit J. 2010 . which can be retrieved from http openvswitch.org papers dccaves2010.pdf . These two papers are incorporated herein by reference.

In order to define the control switching logic for physical switching elements the NOS of some embodiments uses the Open Virtual Switch protocol to create one or more control tables within the control plane of a switch element. The control plane is typically created and executed by a general purpose CPU of the switching element. Once the system has created the control table s the system then writes flow entries to the control table s using the OpenFlow protocol. The general purpose CPU of the physical switching element uses its internal logic to convert entries written to the control table s to populate one or more forwarding tables in the forwarding plane of the switch element. The forwarding tables are created and executed typically by a specialized switching chip of the switching element. Through its execution of the flow entries within the forwarding tables the switching chip of the switching element can process and route packets of data that it receives.

To enable the programmatic access of the applications to the switching elements the NOS also creates the network information base NIB . The NIB is a data structure in which the NOS stores a copy of the switch element states tracked by NOS. The NIB of some embodiments is a graph of all physical or virtual switch elements and their interconnections within a physical network topology and their forwarding tables. For instance in some embodiments each switching element within the network infrastructure is represented by one or more data objects in the NIB. However in other embodiments the NIB stores state information about only some of the switching elements. For example as further described below the NIB in some embodiments only keeps track of switching elements at the edge of a network infrastructure. In yet other embodiments the NIB stores state information about edge switching elements in a network as well as some non edge switching elements in the network that facilitate communication between the edge switching elements. In some embodiments the NIB also stores the logical configuration and the logical state for each user specified LDPS. In these embodiments the information in the NIB that represents the state of the actual switching elements accounts for only a subset of the total information stored in the NIB.

In some embodiments the NIB is the heart of the NOS control model in the virtualized network system . Under one approach applications control the network by reading from and writing to the NIB. Specifically in some embodiments the application control logic can 1 read the current state associated with network entity objects in the NIB 2 alter the network state by operating on these objects and 3 register for notifications of state changes to these objects. Under this model when an application needs to modify a record in a table e.g. a control plane flow table of a switching element the application first uses the NOS APIs to write to one or more objects in the NIB that represent the table in the NIB. The NOS then acting as the switching element s controller propagates this change to the switching element s table. The NIB and NOS of a virtualized network system are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 529 filed Jul. 6 2011 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 743 889. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 529 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 743 889 is incorporated herein by reference.

Next in the third stage the NOS uses the set of switch access APIs to write a new set of values into the switch. In some embodiments the NIB performs a translation operation that modifies the format of the records before writing these records into the NIB. These operations are pictorially illustrated in by showing the values d e f translated into d e f and the writing of these new values into the switch . Alternatively in some embodiments one or more sets of values are kept identically in the NIB and the switching element which thereby causes the NOS to write the NIB values directly to the switch unchanged.

In yet other embodiments the NOS translation operation might modify the set of values in the NIB e.g. the values d e f into a different set of values with fewer values e.g. values x and y where x and y might be a subset of d e and f or completely different or additional values e.g. the w x y z where w x y and z might be a super set of all or some of d e and f or completely different . The NOS in these embodiments would then write this modified set of values e.g. values x and y or values w x y and z into the switching element .

The fourth stage finally shows the switch after the old values a b and c have been replaced in the switch control record with the values d e and f . Again in the example shown in the NOS of some embodiments propagates NIB records to the switches as modified versions of the records that were written to the NIB. In other embodiments the NOS applies processing e.g. data transformation to the NIB records before the NOS propagates the NIB records to the switches and such processing changes the format content and quantity of data written to the switches.

In some embodiments the virtualized system of provides different views of the NIB to different users in order 1 to ensure that different users do not have direct view and control over each other s switching logic and 2 to provide each user with a view of the switching logic at an abstraction level that is desired by the user. For instance in some embodiments the NIB is a hierarchical data structure that represents different attributes of different switching elements as elements e.g. different nodes in a hierarchy. The NIB in some of these embodiments is a multi layer hierarchical data structure with each layer having a hierarchical structure and one or more elements e.g. nodes on each layer linked to one or more elements e.g. nodes on another layer. In some embodiments the lowest layer elements correspond to the actual switching elements and their attributes while each of the higher layer elements serves as abstractions of the actual switching elements and their attributes. As further described below some of these higher layer elements are used in some embodiments to show different abstract switching elements and or switching element attributes to different users in a network control system. In other words the NOS of some embodiments generates the multi layer hierarchical NIB data structure and the NOS or an application that runs on top of the NOS shows different users different views of different parts of the hierarchical levels and or layers in order to provide the different users with virtualized access to the shared switching elements and network.

In system the NIB stores sets of data records for each of the switching elements . In some embodiments a system administrator can access these four sets of data through an application that interfaces with the NOS. However other users that are not system administrators do not have access to all of the four sets of records in the NIB because some switch logic records in the NIB might relate to the logical switching configuration of other users.

Instead each non system administrator user can only view and modify the switching element records in the NIB that relate to the logical switching configuration of the user. illustrates this limited view by showing the application providing a first layered NIB view to a first user and a second layered NIB view to a second user . The first layered NIB view shows the first user data records regarding the configuration of the shared switching elements for implementing the first user s switching logic and the state of this configuration. The second layered NIB view shows the second user data records regarding the configuration of the shared switching elements for implementing the second user s switching logic and the state of this configuration. In viewing their own logical switching configuration neither user can view the other user s logical switching configuration.

In some embodiments each user s NIB view is a higher level NIB view that represents an abstraction of the lowest level NIB view that correlates to the actual network infrastructure that is formed by the switching elements . For instance as shown in the first user s layered NIB view shows two switches that implement the first user s logical switching configuration while the second user s layered NIB view shows one switch that implements the second user s logical switching configuration. This could be the case even if either user s switching configuration uses all four switching elements . However under this approach the first user perceives that his computing devices are interconnected by two switching elements while the second user perceives that her computing devices are interconnected by one switching element.

The first layered NIB view is a reflection of a first set of data records that the application allows the first user to access from the NIB while the second layered NIB view is a representation of a second set of data records that the application allows the second user to access from the NIB. In some embodiments the application retrieves the two sets of data records and from the NIB and maintains these records locally as shown in . In other embodiments however the application does not maintain these two sets of data records locally. Instead in these other embodiments the application simply provides the users with an interface to access the limited set of first and second data records from the NIB . Also in other embodiments the system does not provide switching element abstractions in the higher layered NIB views and that it provides to the users. Rather it simply provides views to the limited first and second set of data records and from the NIB.

Irrespective of whether the application maintains a local copy of the first and second data records or whether the application only provides the switching element abstractions in its higher layered NIB views the application serves as an interface through which each user can view and modify the user s logical switching configuration without being able to view or modify the other user s logical switching configuration. Through the set of APIs provided by the NOS the application propagates to the NIB changes that a user makes to the logical switching configuration view that the user receives from the application. The propagation of these changes entails the transferring and in some cases of some embodiments the transformation of the high level data entered by a user for a higher level NIB view to lower level data that is to be written to lower level NIB data that is stored by the NOS.

In the system of the application can perform several different sets of operations in several different embodiments of the invention as discussed above. Examples of such operations include providing an interface to a user to access NIB data regarding the user s logical switching configuration providing different layered NIB views to different users providing control logic for modifying the provided NIB data providing logic for propagating received modifications to the NIB structure stored by the NOS etc.

The system of some embodiments embeds all such operations in the NOS instead of in the application operating on top of the NOS. Alternatively in other embodiments the system separates these operations into several applications that operate above the NOS. illustrates a virtualized system that employs several such applications. Specifically this figure illustrates a virtualized system that is similar to the virtualized system of except that the operations of the application in the system have been divided into two sets of operations one that is performed by a control application and one that is performed by a virtualization application .

In some embodiments the virtualization application interfaces with the NOS to provide different views of different NIB records to different users through the control application . The control application provides the control logic for allowing a user to specify different operations with respect to the limited NIB records views provided by the virtualization application. Examples of such operations can be read operations from the NIB or write operations to the NIB. The virtualization application then translates these operations into operations that access the NIB. In translating these operations the virtualization application in some embodiments also transfers and or transforms the data that are expressed in terms of the higher level NIB records views to data that are expressed in terms of lower level NIB records.

Even though shows just one control application and one virtualization application being used for the two users the system in other embodiments employs two control applications and or two virtualization applications for the two different users. Similarly even though several of the above described figures show one or more applications operating on a single NOS instance other embodiments provide several different NOS instances on top of each of which one or more applications can execute.

A network control system of different embodiments allows mapping of the LDP sets of the user to the physical switching elements of the control system differently. In some embodiments the virtualization application of the system exposes the definition of different elements at different hierarchical levels in the NIB and the definition of the links between these elements to the control applications that run on top of the NOS and the virtualization application in order to allow the control application to define its operations by reference to these definitions. For instance in some embodiments the developer of the control application running on top of the virtualization application uses these definitions to enumerate how the application is to map the LDP sets of the user to the physical switching elements of the control system. Under this approach the developer would have to enumerate all different scenarios that the control system may encounter and the mapping operation of the application for each scenario.

Alternatively the network control system in some embodiments does not require the application developers to have intimate knowledge of the NIB elements and the links in the NIB between these elements. Instead the virtualization application of the system in these embodiments allows the control applications to simply provide user specified switching element attributes in the form of one or more tables which are then mapped to NIB records by a table mapping engine. In other words the virtualization application accepts switching element configurations e.g. access control list table configurations layer 2 L2 table configurations layer 3 L3 table configurations etc. that the user defines without referencing any operational state of the switching elements in a particular network configuration. The virtualization application then maps the user specified switching element configurations to the switching element configurations stored in the NIB.

More specifically the control application allows 1 a user to specify abstract switching element configurations which the virtualization application then maps to the data records in the NIB and 2 the user to view the state of the abstract switching element configurations. In some embodiments the control application uses a network template library to allow a user to specify a set of logical datapaths by specifying one or more switch element attributes i.e. one or more switch element configurations . In the example shown in the network template library includes several types of tables that a switching element may include. In this example the user has interfaced with the control application to specify an L2 table an L3 table and an access control list ACL table . These three tables specify a LDPS for the user. In specifying these tables the user simply specifies desired switch configuration records for one or more abstract logical switching elements. When specifying these records the user of the system does not have any understanding of the switching elements employed by the system or any data regarding these switching elements from the NIB . The only switch element specific data that the user of the system receives is the data from the network template library which specifies the types of network elements that the user can define in the abstract which the system can then process.

While the example in shows the user specifying an ACL table one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the system of some embodiments does not provide such specific switch table attributes in the library . For instance in some embodiments the switch element abstractions provided by the library are generic switch tables and do not relate to any specific switching element table component and or architecture. In these embodiments the control application enables the user to create generic switch configurations for a generic set of one or more tables. Accordingly the abstraction level of the switch element attributes that the control application allows the user to create is different in different embodiments.

Irrespective of the abstraction level of the switch element attributes produced through the control logic application the virtualization application performs a mapping operation that maps the specified switch element attributes e.g. the specific or generic switch table records to records in the NIB. In some embodiments the virtualization application translates control application input into one or more NIB records . The virtualization application then writes the resulting NIB records to the NIB through the API set provided by NOS. From the NIB these records are then subsequently transferred to the switching infrastructure through the operation of the NOS. In some embodiments the NIB stores both the LDPS input received through the control application as well as the NIB records that are produced by the virtualization application.

In some embodiments the control application can receive switching infrastructure data from the NIB. In response to this data the control application may modify record s associated with one or more LDP sets. Any such modified LDPS record would then be translated to one or more physical switching infrastructure records by the virtualization application which might then be transferred to the physical switching infrastructure by the NOS.

To map the control application input to physical switching infrastructure attributes for storage in the NIB the virtualization application of some embodiments uses a database table mapping engine to map input tables to output tables. These input tables are created from 1 the control application specified input tables and 2 a set of properties associated with switching elements used by the system. The content of these output tables are then transferred to the NIB elements.

Some embodiments use a variation of the datalog database language to allow application developers to create the table mapping engine for the virtualization application and thereby to specify the manner by which the virtualization application maps LDP sets to the controlled physical switching infrastructure. This variation of the datalog database language is referred to below as nLog. Like datalog nLog provides a few declaratory rules and operators that allow a developer to specify different operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of different events. In some embodiments nLog provides a limited subset of the operators that are provided by datalog in order to increase the operational speed of nLog. For instance in some embodiments nLog only allows the AND operator to be used in any of the declaratory rules.

The declaratory rules and operations that are specified through nLog are then compiled into a much larger set of rules by an nLog compiler. In some embodiments this compiler translates each rule that is meant to address an event into several sets of database join operations. Collectively the larger set of rules forms the table mapping rules engine that is referred to below as the nLog engine. The nLog mapping techniques of some embodiments is further described below.

In some embodiments the nLog virtualization engine provides feedback e.g. from one or more of the output tables or from NIB records that are updated to reflect values stored in the output tables to the user in order to provide the user with state information about the LDPS that he or she created. In this manner the updates that the user gets are expressed in terms of the logical space that the user understands and not in terms of the underlying switching element states which the user does not understand.

The use of nLog allows the application developers to produce applications that express the user specified LDP sets in terms of one or more tables which are then automatically mapped to output tables whose content are in turn transferred to the NIB. Also because the nLog provides a machine generated rules engine that addresses the mapping between the logical and physical domains the need for maintaining the data regarding the LDP sets in the NIB is eliminated. However some embodiments maintain this data in the NIB in order to distribute this data among other NOS instances as further described below.

As mentioned above the NIB in some embodiments stores data regarding each switching element within the network infrastructure of a system while in other embodiments the NIB stores state information about only switching elements at the edge of a network infrastructure. illustrate an example that differentiates the two differing approaches. Specifically illustrates the switch infrastructure of a multi tenant server hosting system. In this system six switching elements are employed to interconnect six computing devices of two users A and B. Four of these switches are edge switches that have direct connections with the computing devices of the users A and B while two of the switches and are interior switches i.e. non edge switches that interconnect the edge switches and connect to each other.

The system of some embodiments only controls edge switches i.e. only maintains data in the NIB regarding edge switches for several reasons. Controlling edge switches provides the system with a sufficient mechanism for maintaining isolation between computing devices which is needed as opposed to maintaining isolation between all switch elements which is not needed. The interior switches forward data packets between switching elements. The edge switches forward data packets between computing devices and other network elements e.g. other switching elements . Thus the system can maintain user isolation simply by controlling the edge switch because the edge switch is the last switch in line to forward packets to a host.

Controlling only edge switches also allows the system to be deployed independent of concerns about the hardware vendor of the non edge switches because deploying at the edge allows the edge switches to treat the internal nodes of the network as simply a collection of elements that moves packets without considering the hardware makeup of these internal nodes. Also controlling only edge switches makes distributing switching logic computationally easier. Controlling only edge switches also enables non disruptive deployment of the system because edge switching solutions can be added as top of rack switches without disrupting the configuration of the non edge switches.

In addition to controlling edge switches the network control system of some embodiments also utilizes and controls non edge switches that are inserted in the switch network hierarchy to simplify and or facilitate the operation of the controlled edge switches. For instance in some embodiments the control system requires the switches that it controls to be interconnected in a hierarchical switching architecture that has several edge switches as the leaf nodes and one or more non edge switches as the non leaf nodes. In some such embodiments each edge switch connects to one or more of the non leaf switches and uses such non leaf switches to facilitate its communication with other edge switches. Examples of functions that a non leaf switch of some embodiments may provide to facilitate such communications between edge switch in some embodiments include 1 routing of a packet with an unknown destination address e.g. unknown MAC address to the non leaf switch so that this switch can route this packet to the appropriate edge switch 2 routing a multicast or broadcast packet to the non leaf switch so that this switch can convert this packet to a series of unicast packets to the desired destinations 3 bridging remote managed networks that are separated by one or more networks and 4 bridging a managed network with an unmanaged network.

Some embodiments employ one level of non leaf non edge switches that connect to edge switches and in some cases to other non leaf switches. Other embodiments on the other hand employ multiple levels of non leaf switches with each level of non leaf switch after the first level serving as a mechanism to facilitate communication between lower level non leaf switches and leaf switches. In some embodiments the non leaf switches are software switches that are implemented by storing the switching tables in the memory of a standalone computer instead of an off the shelf switch. In some embodiments the standalone computer may also be executing in some cases a hypervisor and one or more virtual machines on top of that hypervisor. Irrespective of the manner by which the leaf and non leaf switches are implemented the NIB of the control system of some embodiments stores switching state information regarding the leaf and non leaf switches.

The above discussion relates to the control of edge switches and non edge switches by a network control system of some embodiments. In some embodiments edge switches and non edge switches leaf and non leaf nodes may be referred to as managed switching elements. This is because these switches are managed by the network control system as opposed to unmanaged switching elements which are not managed by the network control system in the network in order to implement LDP sets through the managed switching elements.

In addition to using the NIB to store switching element data the virtualized network control system of some embodiments also stores other storage structures to store data regarding the switching elements of the network. These other storage structures are secondary storage structures that supplement the storage functions of the NIB which is the primary storage structure of the system while the system operates. In some embodiments the primary purpose for one or more of the secondary storage structures is to back up the data in the NIB. In these or other embodiments one or more of the secondary storage structures serves a purpose other than backing up the data in the NIB e.g. for storing data that are not in the NIB . For instance the secondary storage structure of some embodiments is used as a communication channel among virtualization applications and or other applications that run on top of the NOS a communication channel between different network controllers of the system a medium through which physical plane data are pushed to the managed switching elements of the system etc.

In some embodiments the NIB is stored in system memory e.g. RAM while the system operates. This allows for the fast access of the NIB records. In some embodiments one or more of the secondary storage structures on the other hand are stored on disk or other non volatile memories that are slower to access. Such non volatile disk or other storages however improve the resiliency of the system as they allow the data to be stored in a persistent manner.

In some embodiments the PTD is a database that is stored on disk or other non volatile memory. In some embodiments the PTD is a commonly available database such as MySQL or SQLite. The PTD of some embodiments can handle complex transactional queries. As a transactional database the PTD can undo a series of prior query operations that it has performed as part of a transaction when one of the subsequent query operations of the transaction fails. Moreover some embodiments define a transactional guard processing TGP layer before the PTD in order to allow the PTD to execute conditional sets of database transactions. The TGP layer allows the PTD to avoid unnecessary later database operations when conditions of earlier operations are not met.

The PTD in some embodiments stores the exact replica of the data that are stored in the NIB while in other embodiments it stores only a subset of the data that are stored in the NIB. Some or all of the data in the NIB are stored in the PTD in order to ensure that the NIB data will not be lost in the event of a crash of the NOS or the NIB.

The PNTD is another persistent database that is stored on disk or other non volatile memory. Some embodiments use this database to store data e.g. statistics computations etc. regarding one or more switch element attributes or operations. For instance this database is used in some embodiment to store the number of packets routed through a particular port of a particular switching element. Other examples of types of data stored in the database include error messages log files warning messages and billing data. Also in some embodiments the PNTD stores the results of operations performed by the application s running on top of the NOS while the PTD and hash table store only values generated by the NOS.

The PNTD in some embodiments has a database query manager that can process database queries but as it is not a transactional database this query manager cannot handle complex conditional transactional queries. In some embodiments accesses to the PNTD are faster than accesses to the PTD but slower than accesses to the hash table .

Unlike the databases and the hash table is not a database that is stored on disk or other non volatile memory. Instead it is a storage structure that is stored in volatile system memory e.g. RAM . It uses hashing techniques that use hashed indices to quickly identify records that are stored in the table. This structure combined with the hash table s placement in the system memory allows this table to be accessed very quickly. To facilitate this quick access a simplified query interface is used in some embodiments. For instance in some embodiments the hash table has just two queries a Put query for writing values to the table and a Get query for retrieving values from the table. Some embodiments use the hash table to store data that change quickly. Examples of such quick changing data include network entity status statistics state uptime link arrangement and packet handling information. Furthermore in some embodiments the NOS uses the hash tables as a cache to store information that is repeatedly queried for such as flow entries that will be written to multiple nodes. Some embodiments employ a hash structure in the NIB in order to quickly access records in the NIB. Accordingly in some of these embodiments the hash table is part of the NIB data structure.

The PTD and the PNTD improve the resiliency of the NOS system by preserving network data on hard disks. If a NOS system fails network configuration data will be preserved on disk in the PTD and log file information will be preserved on disk in the PNTD.

Using a single NOS instance to control a network can lead to scaling and reliability issues. As the number of network elements increases the processing power and or memory capacity that are required by those elements will saturate a single node. Some embodiments further improve the resiliency of the control system by having multiple instances of NOS running on one or more computers with each instance of NOS containing one or more of the secondary storage structures described above. The control applications in some embodiments partition the workload between the different instances in order to reduce each instance s workload. Also in some embodiments the multiple instances of NOS communicate the information stored in their storage layers to enable each instance of NOS to cover for the others in the event of a NOS instance failing.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 533 filed Jul. 6 2011 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 817 620 describes different embodiments of a multi instance distributed network control system that controls the operations of the same switch or of different switches by distributing workload over different controller instances. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 533 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 817 620 is incorporated herein by reference.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 533 also describes different approaches that the multi instance distributed network control system takes to maintain a global NIB data structure e.g. a collection of switch element data in different NIB instances of different controller instances in each of the controller instances using secondary storage structures such as a distributed hash table DHT a persistent non transaction database PNTD and a PTD.

In the example illustrated in both control applications and of both controllers and can modify records of the switching element S for both users A and B but only controller is the master of this switching element. This example illustrates two different scenarios. The first scenario involves the controller updating the record S in switching element S for the user B. The second scenario involves the controller updating the records S in switching element S after the control application updates a NIB record S for switching element S and user A in NIB . In the example illustrated in this update is routed from NIB of the controller to the NIB of the controller and subsequently routed to switching element S.

Different embodiments use different techniques to propagate changes to the NIB of controller instance to the NIB of the controller instance . For instance to propagate changes the system in some embodiments uses the secondary storage structures not shown of the controller instances and . More generally the distributed control system of some embodiments uses the secondary storage structures as communication channels between the different controller instances. Because of the differing properties of the secondary storage structures these structures provide the controller instances with different mechanisms for communicating with each other. For instance in some embodiments different DHT instances can be different and each DHT instance is used as a bulletin board for one or more instances to store data so that they or other instances can retrieve this data later. In some of these embodiments the PTDs are replicated across all instances and some or all of the NIB changes are pushed from one controller instance to another through the PTD storage layer. Accordingly in the example illustrated in the change to the NIB could be replicated to the PTD of the controller and from there it could be replicated in the PTD of the controller and the NIB .

Instead of propagating the NIB changes through the secondary storages the system of some embodiments uses other techniques to change the record S in the switch S in response to the request from control application . For instance to propagate this update the NOS of the controller in some embodiments sends an update command to the NOS of the controller with the requisite NIB update parameters that identify the record and one or more new values for the record to direct the NOS to modify the record in the NIB or in the switch S. In response the NOS would make the changes to the NIB and the switch S if such a change is allowed . After this change the controller instance would change the corresponding record in its NIB once it receives notification from controller or through another notification mechanism that the record in the NIB and or switch S has changed. Moreover the NOS instances of two controller instances establish remote procedure call RPC channels to exchange records in their NIBs in some embodiments.

Other variations to the sequence of operations shown in could exist because some embodiments designate one controller instance as a master of a portion of the NIB in addition to designating a controller instance as a master of a switching element. In some embodiments different controller instances can be masters of a switch and a corresponding record for that switch in the NIB while other embodiments require the controller instance to be master of the switch and all records for that switch in the NIB.

In the embodiments where the system allows for the designation of masters for switching elements and NIB records the example illustrated in illustrates a case where the controller instance is the master of the NIB record S while the controller instance is the master for the switch S. If a controller instance other than the controller instance and was the master of the NIB record S then the request for the NIB record modification from the control application would have had to be propagated to this other controller instance. This other controller instance would then modify the NIB record and this modification would then cause the NIB the NIB and the switch S to update their records once the controller instances and are notified of this modification through any number of mechanisms that would propagate this modification to the controller instances and .

In other embodiments the controller instance might be the master of the NIB record S or the controller instance might be the master of switch S and all the records of its NIB. In these embodiments the request for the NIB record modification from the control application would have to be propagated to the controller instance which would then modify the records in the NIB and the switch S. Once this modification is made the NIB would modify its record S once the controller instance is notified of this modification through any number of mechanisms that would propagate this modification to the controller instance .

As mentioned above different embodiments employ different techniques to facilitate communication between different controller instances. In addition different embodiments implement the controller instances differently. For instance in some embodiments the stack of the control application s e.g. in the virtualization application e.g. and the NOS e.g. is installed and runs on a single computer. Also in some embodiments multiple controller instances can be installed and run in parallel on a single computer. In some embodiments a controller instance can also have its stack of components divided amongst several computers. For example within one instance the control application e.g. can be on a first physical or virtual computer the virtualization application e.g. can be on a second physical or virtual computer and the NOS e.g. can be on a third physical or virtual computer.

Each controller instance includes a NOS a virtualization application a control application an input translation application and a coordination manager CM . Each NOS in the system includes a NIB and at least two secondary storage structures e.g. a distributed hash table DHT and a PNTD . In addition the control system has a NIB notification module NIB transfer modules a CM interface PTD triggers DHT triggers and master slave PTDs .

In some embodiments the notification module in each controller instance allows applications e.g. a control application that run on top of the NOS to register for callbacks when changes occur within the NIB. This module in some embodiments has two components which include a notification processor and a notification registry. The notification registry stores the list of applications that need to be notified for each NIB record that the module tracks while the notification processor reviews the registry and processes the notifications upon detecting a change in a NIB record that it tracks. The notification module as well as its notification registry and notification processor are a conceptual representation of the NIB application layer notification components of some embodiments as the system of these embodiments provides a separate notification function and registry within each NIB object that can be tracked by the application layer.

The transfer modules include one or more modules that allow data to be exchanged between the NIB on one hand and the PTD or DHT storage layers in each controller instance on the other hand. In some embodiments the transfer modules include an import module for importing changes from the PTD DHT storage layers into the NIB and an export module for exporting changes in the NIB to the PTD DHT storage layers.

While the control system of some embodiments has the same type of PTD in each instance the control system only has PTDs in some of the NOS instances and of these PTDs one of them serves as master PTD while the rest serve as slave PTDs . In some embodiments NIB changes within a controller instance that has a slave PTD are first propagated to the master PTD which then direct the controller instance s slave PTD to record the NIB change. The master PTD similarly receives NIB changes from controller instances that do not have either master or slave PTDs.

In the control system the coordination manager includes the CM interface to facilitate communication between the NIB storage layer and the PTD storage layer. The CM interface also maintains the PTD trigger list which identifies the modules of the system to callback whenever the CM interface is notified of a PTD record change. A similar trigger list for handling DHT callbacks is maintained by the DHT instance . The CM also has a DHT range identifier not shown that allows the DHT instances of different controller instances to store different DHT records in different DHT instances.

Also in the control system the PNTD is not placed underneath the NIB storage layer. This placement is to signify that the PNTD in the control system does not exchange data directly with the NIB storage layer but rather is accessible solely by the application s e.g. the control application running on top of the NOS as well as other applications of other controller instances. This placement is in contrast to the placement of the PTD storage layer and DHT storage layers which are shown to be underneath the NIB storage layer because the PTD and DHT are not directly accessible by the application s running on top of the NOS . Rather in the control system data are exchanged between the NIB storage layer and the PTD DHT storage layers of the same or different instances.

The control system uses the PTD DHT and PNTD storage layers to facilitate communication between the different controller instances. In some embodiments each of the three storages of the secondary storage layer uses a different storage and distribution technique to improve the resiliency of the distributed multi instance system . For instance the system of some embodiments replicates the PTD across NOS instances so that every NOS has a full copy of the PTD to enable a failed NOS instance to quickly reload its PTD from another instance. On the other hand the system in some embodiments distributes the PNTD with partial overlapping distributions of data across the NOS instances to reduce the damage of a failure. Similarly the system in some embodiments distributes the DHT fully or with minimal overlap across multiple controller instances in order to maintain the DHT instance within each instance small. Also using this approach allows the system to increase the size of the DHT by adding additional DHT instances in order to make the system more scalable.

One of the advantages of this system is that it can be configured in any number of ways. In some embodiments this system provides great flexibility to specify the configurations for the components of the system in order to customize its storage and data distribution scheme to achieve the best tradeoff of scalability and speed on one hand and reliability and consistency on the other hand. Attributes of the storage structures that affect scalability speed reliability and consistency considerations include the speed of the storage e.g. RAM versus disk access speed the reliability of the storage e.g. persistent non volatile storage of disk versus volatile storage of RAM the query interface of the storage e.g. simple Put Get query interface of DHT versus more robust transactional database queries of PTD in some embodiments and the number of points of failures in the system e.g. a single point of failure for a DHT record versus multiple points of failure for a PTD record in some embodiments .

Through the configurations of its components the system can be configured 1 on how to distribute the data records between the NIB and the secondary storage structures within one instance e.g. which secondary storage should store which NIB record 2 on how to distribute the data records between the NIBs of different instances e.g. which NIB records should be replicated across different controller instances 3 on how to distribute the data records between the secondary storage structures within one instance e.g. which secondary storage records contain which records 4 on how to distribute the data records between the secondary storage structures of different instances e.g. which secondary storage records are replicated across different controller instances 5 on how to distribute secondary storage instances across controller instances e.g. whether to put a PTD a DHT or a Stats database instances within each controller or whether to put different subset of these storages within different instances and 6 on how to replicate data records in the distributed secondary storage structures e.g. whether to replicated PTD fully across all instances whether to replicate some or all DHT records across more than one instance etc. . The system also allows the coordination between the different controller instances as to the master control over different switching elements or different portions of the NIB to be configured differently. In some embodiments some or all of these configurations can be specified by applications e.g. a control application or a virtualization application that run on top of the NOS.

In some embodiments as noted above the CMs facilitate inter controller communication related to fault tolerance of controller instances. For instance the CMs implement the inter controller communication through the secondary storage layers described above. A controller instance in the control system may fail due to any number of reasons. e.g. hardware failure software failure network failure etc. . Different embodiments may use different techniques for determining whether a controller instance has failed. In some embodiments Paxos protocol is used to determine whether a controller instance in the control system has failed. While some of these embodiments may use Apache Zookeeper to implement the Paxos protocols other embodiments may implement Paxos protocol in other ways.

Some embodiments of the CM may utilize defined timeouts to determine whether a controller instance has failed. For instance if a CM of a controller instance does not respond to a communication e.g. sent from another CM of another controller instance in the control system within an amount of time i.e. a defined timeout amount the non responsive controller instance is determined to have failed. Other techniques may be utilized to determine whether a controller instance has failed in other embodiments.

When a master controller instance fails a new master for the LDP sets and the switching elements needs to be determined. Some embodiments of the CM make such determination by performing a master election process that elects a master controller instance e.g. for partitioning management of LDP sets and or partitioning management of switching elements . The CM of some embodiments may perform a master election process for electing a new master controller instance for both the LDP sets and the switching elements of which the failed controller instance was a master. However the CM of other embodiments may perform 1 a master election process for electing a new master controller instance for the LDP sets of which the failed controller instance was a master and 2 another master election process for electing a new master controller instance for the switching elements of which the failed controller instance was a master. In these cases the CM may determine two different controller instances as new controller instances one for the LDP sets of which the failed controller instance was a master and another for the switching elements of which the failed controller instance was a master.

In some embodiments the master election process is further for partitioning management of LDP sets and or management of switching elements when a controller instance is added to the control system. In particular some embodiments of the CM perform the master election process when the control system detects a change in membership of the controller instances in the control system . For instance the CM may perform the master election process to redistribute a portion of the management of the LDP sets and or the management of the switching elements from the existing controller instances to the new controller instance when the control system detects that a new network controller has been added to the control system . However in other embodiments redistribution of a portion of the management of the LDP sets and or the management of the switching elements from the existing controller instances to the new controller instance does not occur when the control system detects that a new network controller has been added to the control system . Instead the control system in these embodiments assigns unassigned LDP sets and or switching elements e.g. new LDP sets and or switching elements or LDP sets and or switching elements from a failed network controller to the new controller instance when the control system detects the unassigned LDP sets and or switching elements.

Also in some embodiments the NOS instance provides multiple methods for applications to gain access to network entities. For instance in some embodiments it maintains an index of all of its entities based on the entity identifier allowing for direct querying of a specific entity. The NOS instance of some embodiments also supports registration for notifications on state changes or the addition deletion of an entity. In some embodiments the applications may further extend the querying capabilities by listening for notifications of entity arrival and maintaining their own indices. In some embodiments the control for a typical application is fairly straightforward. It can register to be notified on some state change e.g. the addition of new switches and ports and once notified it can manipulate the network state by modifying the NIB data tuple s e.g. key value pairs of the affected entities.

As shown in the NOS includes an application interface a notification processor a notification registry a NIB a hash table a NOS controller a switch controller transfer modules a CM a PTD a CM interface a PNTD a DHT instance switch interface and NIB request list .

The application interface is a conceptual illustration of the interface between the NOS and the applications e.g. control and virtualization applications that can run on top of the NOS. The interface includes the NOS APIs that the applications e.g. control or virtualization application running on top of the NOS use to communicate with the NOS. In some embodiments these communications include registrations for receiving notifications of certain changes in the NIB queries to read certain NIB attributes queries to write to certain NIB attributes requests to create or destroy NIB entities instructions for configuring the NOS instance e.g. instructions regarding how to import or export state information requests to import or export entities on demand and requests to synchronize NIB entities with switching elements or other NOS instances.

The switch interface is a conceptual illustration of the interface between the NOS and the switching elements that run below the NOS instance . In some embodiments the NOS accesses the switching elements by using the OpenFlow or OVS APIs provided by the switching elements. Accordingly in some embodiments the switch interface includes the set of APIs provided by the OpenFlow and or OVS protocols.

The NIB is the data storage structure that stores data regarding the switching elements that the NOS instance is controlling. In some embodiments the NIB just stores data attributes regarding these switching elements while in other embodiments the NIB also stores data attributes for the LDP sets defined by the user. Also in some embodiments the NIB is a hierarchical object data structure such as the ones described above in which some or all of the NIB objects not only include data attributes e.g. data tuples regarding the switching elements but also include functions to perform certain functionalities of the NIB. For these embodiments one or more of the NOS functionalities that are shown in modular form in are conceptual representations of the functions performed by the NIB objects.

The hash table is a table that stores a hash value for each NIB object and a reference to each NIB object. Specifically each time an object is created in the NIB the object s identifier is hashed to generate a hash value and this hash value is stored in the hash table along with a reference e.g. a pointer to the object. The hash table is used to quickly access an object in the NIB each time a data attribute or function of the object is requested e.g. by an application or secondary storage . Upon receiving such requests the NIB hashes the identifier of the requested object to generate a hash value and then uses that hash value to quickly identify in the hash table a reference to the object in the NIB. In some cases a request for a NIB object might not provide the identity of the NIB object but instead might be based on non entity name keys e.g. might be a request for all entities that have a particular port . For these cases the NIB includes an iterator that iterates through all entities looking for the key specified in the request.

The notification processor interacts with the application interface to receive NIB notification registrations from applications running on top of the NOS and other modules of the NOS e.g. such as an export module within the transfer modules . Upon receiving these registrations the notification processor stores notification requests in the notification registry that identifies each requesting party and the NIB data tuple s that the requesting party is tracking.

As mentioned above the system of some embodiments embeds in each NIB object a function for handling notification registrations for changes in the value s of that NIB object. For these embodiments the notification processor is a conceptual illustration of the amalgamation of all the NIB object notification functions. Other embodiments however do not provide notification functions in some or all of the NIB objects. The NOS of some of these embodiments therefore provides an actual separate module to serve as the notification processor for some or all of the NIB objects.

When some or all of the NIB objects have notification functions in some embodiments the notification registry for such NIB objects are typically kept with the objects themselves. Accordingly for some of these embodiments the notification registry is a conceptual illustration of the amalgamation of the different sets of registered requestors maintained by the NIB objects. Alternatively when some or all of the NIB objects do not have notification functions and notification services are needed for these objects some embodiments use a separate notification registry for the notification processor to use to keep track of the notification requests for such objects.

The notification process serves as only one manner for accessing the data in the NIB. Other mechanisms are needed in some embodiments for accessing the NIB. For instance the secondary storage structures e.g. the PTD and the DHT instance also need to be able to import data from and export data to the NIB. For these operations the NOS uses the transfer modules to exchange data between the NIB and the secondary storage structure.

In some embodiments the transfer modules include a NIB import module and a NIB export module. These two modules in some embodiments are configured through the NOS controller which processes configuration instructions that it receives through the interfaces from the applications above the NOS. The NOS controller also performs several other operations. As with the notification processor some or all of the operations performed by the NOS controller are performed by one or more functions of NIB objects in some of the embodiments that implement one or more of the NOS operations through the NIB object functions. Accordingly for these embodiments the NOS controller is a conceptual amalgamation of several NOS operations some of which are performed by NIB object functions.

Other than configuration requests the NOS controller of some embodiments handles some of the other types of requests directed at the NOS instance . Examples of such other requests include queries to read certain NIB attributes queries to write to certain NIB attributes requests to create or destroy NIB entities requests to import or export entities on demand and requests to synchronize NIB entities with switching elements or other NOS instances.

In some embodiments the NOS controller stores requests to change the NIB on the NIB request list . Like the notification registry the NIB request list in some embodiments is a conceptual representation of a set of distributed requests that are stored in a distributed manner with the objects in the NIB. Alternatively for embodiments in which some or all of the NIB objects do not maintain their modification requests locally the request list is a separate list maintained by the NOS . The system of some of these embodiments that maintains the request list as a separate list stores this list in the NIB in order to allow for its replication across the different controller instances through the PTD storage layer and or the DHT storage layer. This replication allows the distributed controller instances to process in a uniform manner a request that is received from an application operating on one of the controller instances.

Synchronization requests are used to maintain consistency in NIB data in some embodiments that employ multiple NIB instances in a distributed control system. For instance the NIB of some embodiments provides a mechanism to request and release exclusive access to the NIB data structure of the local instance. As such an application running on top of the NOS instance s is only assured that no other thread is updating the NIB within the same controller instance. The application therefore needs to implement mechanisms external to the NIB to coordinate an effort with other controller instances to control access to the NIB. In some embodiments this coordination is static and requires control logic involvement during failure conditions.

Also in some embodiments all NIB operations are asynchronous meaning that updating a network entity only guarantees that the update will eventually be pushed to the corresponding switching element and or other NOS instances. While this has the potential to simplify the application logic and make multiple modifications more efficient often it is useful to know when an update has successfully completed. For instance to minimize disruption to network traffic the application logic of some embodiments requires the updating of forwarding state on multiple switches to happen in a particular order to minimize for example packet drops . For this purpose the API of some embodiments provides the synchronization request primitive that calls back one or more applications running on top of the NOS once the state has been pushed for an entity. After receiving the callback the control application of some embodiments will then inspect the content of the NIB and determine whether its state is still as originally intended. Alternatively in some embodiments the control application can simply rely on NIB notifications to react to failures in modifications as they would react to any other network state changes.

The NOS controller is also responsible for pushing the changes in its corresponding NIB to switching elements for which the NOS is the master. To facilitate writing such data to the switching elements the NOS controller uses the switch controller . It also uses the switch controller to read values from a switching element. To access a switching element the switch controller uses the switch interface which as mentioned above uses OpenFlow or OVS or other known set of APIs in some embodiments.

Like the PTD and DHT storage structures and of the control system of the PTD and DHT storage structures and of interface with the NIB and not the application layer. In other words some embodiments only limit PTD and DHT layers to communicate between the NIB layer and these two storage layers and to communicate between the PTD DHT storages of one instance and PTD DHT storages of other instances. Other embodiments however allow the application layer e.g. the control application within one instance to access the PTD and DHT storages directly or through the transfer modules . These embodiments might provide PTD and DHT access handles e.g. APIs to DHT PTD or CM interface as part of the application interface or might provide handles to the transfer modules that interact with the PTD layer e.g. the CM interface and DHT layers so that the applications can directly interact with the PTD and DHT storage layers.

Also like structures and the PTD and DHT instance have corresponding lists of triggers that are respectively maintained in the CM interface and the DHT instance . Also like the PNTD of the control system the PNTD of does not interface with the NIB . Instead it interfaces with the application layer through the application interface . Through this interface the applications running on top of the NOS can store data in and retrieve data from the PNTD. Also applications of other controller instances can access the PNTD as shown in .

In some embodiments these five layers are in the same controller instance. However other arrangements of these layers exist in other embodiments. For instance each of the five layers may be in a different controller instance. One or more of the five layers may be in one controller instance too. As a more specific example only the control layer the virtualization layer and the NIB of the NOS that initially stores the output of the virtualization layer are in the same controller instance but the functionality to propagate the customized physical control plane CPCP data reside in a NOS of another controller instance not shown in some embodiments. In these embodiments the universal physical control plane UPCP data is transferred from the initial NIB to the NIB of a NOS of the other controller instance before this other controller instance generates and pushes the CPCP data to the managed switching element. The former controller instance may be a logical controller that generates UPCP data and the latter controller instance may be a physical controller that customizes the UPCP data into CPCP data.

As shown in the input translation layer in some embodiments has a LCP that can be used to express the output of this layer. In some embodiments an application e.g. web based application not shown is provided to the users for them to supply inputs specifying the logical datapath LDP sets. This application sends the inputs in the form of API calls to the input translation layer which translates them into LCP data in a format that can be processed by the control layer . For instance the inputs are translated into a set of input events that can be fed into an nLog table mapping engine of the control layer. The nLog table mapping engine and its operation will be described further below and is also further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 532 filed Jul. 6 2011 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 743 888. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 532 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 743 888 is incorporated herein by reference. In those embodiments where the input translation layer is in a controller instance separate from the controller instance in which the other three layers are the input translation layer sends the input events to the control layer through one or more communication channels e.g. remote procedure call RPC channels .

The control layer in some embodiments has the LCP and the LFP that can be used to express the input and output to this layer. The LCP includes a collection of higher level constructs that allow the control layer and its users to specify one or more LDP sets within the LCP for one or more users. The LFP represents the LDP sets of the users in a format that can be processed by the virtualization layer . In this manner the two logical planes and are virtualization space analogs of the control and forwarding planes and that typically can be found in a typical managed switching element as shown.

In some embodiments the control layer defines and exposes the LCP constructs with which the layer itself or users of the layer define different LDP sets within the LCP. For instance in some embodiments the LCP data includes logical ACL data etc. Some of this data e.g. logical ACL data can be specified by the user while other such data e.g. the logical L2 or L3 records are generated by the control layer and may not be specified by the user. In some embodiments the control layer generates and or specifies such data in response to certain changes to the NIB which indicate changes to the managed switching elements and the managed datapaths that the control layer detects.

In some embodiments the LCP data i.e. the LDP sets data that is expressed in terms of the control plane constructs can be initially specified without consideration of current operational data from the managed switching elements and without consideration of the manner by which this control plane data will be translated to physical control plane data. For instance the LCP data might specify control data for one logical switch that connects five computers even though this control plane data might later be translated to physical control data for three managed switching elements that implement the desired switching between the five computers.

The control layer includes a set of modules for converting any LDPS within the LCP to a LDPS in the LFP . In some embodiments the control layer uses the nLog table mapping engine to perform this conversion. The control layer s use of the nLog table mapping engine to perform this conversion is further described below. The control layer also includes a set of modules for pushing the LDP sets from the LFP of the control layer to a LFP of the virtualization layer .

The LFP includes one or more LDP sets of one or more users. The LFP in some embodiments includes logical forwarding data for one or more LDP sets of one or more users. Some of this data is pushed to the LFP by the control layer while other such data are pushed to the LFP by the virtualization layer detecting events in the NIB as further described below for some embodiments.

In addition to the LFP the virtualization layer includes a UPCP . The UPCP includes UPCP data for the LDP sets. The virtualization layer includes a set of modules not shown for converting the LDP sets within the LFP to UPCP data in the UPCP . In some embodiments the virtualization layer uses the nLog table mapping engine to perform this conversion. The virtualization layer of some embodiments also includes a set of modules not shown for pushing the UPCP data from the UPCP of the virtualization layer to the UPCP of the customization layer .

In some embodiments the UPCP data that is sent to the customization layer allows managed switching element to process data packets according to the LDP sets specified by the control layer . However in contrast to the CPCP data the UPCP data is not a complete implementation of the logical data specified by the control layer because the UPCP data in some embodiments does not express the differences in the managed switching elements and or location specific information of the managed switching elements.

The UPCP data has to be translated into the CPCP data for each managed switching element in order to completely implement the LDP sets at the managed switching elements. For instance when the LDP sets specifies a tunnel that spans several managed switching elements the UPCP data expresses one end of the tunnel using a particular network address e.g. IP address of the managed switching element representing that end. However each of the other managed switching elements over which the tunnel spans uses a port number that is local to the managed switching element to refer to the end managed switching element having the particular network address. That is the particular network address has to be translated to the local port number for each of the managed switching elements in order to completely implement the LDP sets specifying the tunnel at the managed switching elements.

The UPCP data as intermediate data to be translated into CPCP data enables the control system of some embodiments to scale assuming that the customization layer is running in another controller instance in some embodiments. This is because the virtualization layer does not have to convert the LFP data specifying the LDP sets to CPCP data for each of the managed switching elements that implements the LDP sets. Instead the virtualization layer converts the LFP data to universal physical control data once for all the managed switching elements that implement the LDP sets. In this manner the virtualization application saves computational resources that it would otherwise have to spend to perform conversion of the LDP sets to CPCP data for as many times as the number of the managed switching elements that implement the LDP sets.

The customization layer includes the UPCP and a CPCP that can be used to express the input and output to this layer. The customization layer includes a set of modules not shown for converting the UPCP data in the UPCP into CPCP data in the CPCP . In some embodiments the customization layer uses the nLog table mapping engine to perform this conversion. The customization layer also includes a set of modules not shown for pushing the CPCP data from the CPCP of the customization layer into the managed switching elements .

The CPCP data that is pushed to each managed switching element is specific to the managed switching element. The CPCP data allows the managed switching element to perform physical switching operations in both the physical and logical data processing domains. In some embodiments the customization layer runs in a separate controller instance for each of the managed switching elements .

In some embodiments the customization layer does not run in a controller instance. The customization layer in these embodiments resides in the managed switching elements . Therefore in these embodiments the virtualization layer sends the UPCP data to the managed switching elements. Each managed switching element will customize the UPCP data into CPCP data specific to the managed switching element. In some of these embodiments a controller daemon runs in each managed switching element and will perform the conversion of the universal data into the customized data for the managed switching element. A controller daemon will be described further below.

In some embodiments the CPCP data that is propagated to the managed switching element enables this switching element to perform physical forwarding operations on network data e.g. packets based on the logical values defined in the logical domain. Specifically in some embodiments the CPCP data specify flow entries that include the logical values. These logical values include logical addresses logical port numbers and etc. that are used to forward the network data in the logical domain. These flow entries also map the logical values to the physical values defined in the physical domain such that the managed switching element can perform logical forwarding operations on the network data by performing physical forwarding operations based on the logical values. In this manner the physical control plane data facilitates implementing logical switching elements across managed switching elements. Several examples of using the propagated physical control plane data to implement logical data processing in the managed switching elements is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 535 filed Jul. 6 2011 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 750 164. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 177 535 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 750 164 is incorporated herein by reference.

The control plane data that is handled by a layer of the control data pipeline gets more global as the higher the layer is. That is the LCP data in the control layer would span the entire set of managed switching elements that implement a logical switching element defined by the LCP data. In contrast the CPCP data in the customization layer is local and specific to each of the managed switching elements that implement the logical switching element.

In some embodiments the NIB serves as a medium for communications between different layers. Each of the layers in a controller instance pushes the data that the layer has generated into the NIB so that another layer above or below the layer detects the data change in the NIB and uses the data to perform the other layer s portion of the processing pipeline . In other embodiments the layers of a controller instance may directly push generated data to the layer above or below without resorting to the NIB as a communication medium e.g. by establishing and using RPC channels between the layers . In some embodiments the NIB also serves as a medium for communications between different controller instances as described above by reference to .

In this example none of the controller instances and has all five layers or perform the entire control data pipeline . Specifically the controller instance includes input translation layer and NOS . The controller instance includes control layer virtualization layer and NOS . The controller instance includes customization layer and NOS . Each NOS instance in each of the controller instances maintains a NIB as shown.

The controller instance in this example is a controller instance for distributing inputs. That is the controller instance of some embodiments takes the inputs from the users in the form of API calls. Through the API calls the users can specify requests for configuring a particular LDPS e.g. configuring a logical switching element or a logical router to be implemented in a set of managed switching elements or specify requests for information inquires e.g. network traffic statistics for the logical ports of the logical switch of the user . The input module of the controller instance receives these API calls and translates them into the form e.g. data tuples or records that can be pushed into the NIB of the NOS .

The NOS in this example then sends these NIB records to another controller instance that is responsible for managing the records for the particular LDPS. In this example the controller instance is responsible for the records for the LDPS. The controller instance updates the NIB with the records received. This data propagation from the NIB of the controller instance to the NIB of the controller instance can be achieved through any of the different ways described above by reference to . For instance the data from the NIB may be replicated to the NIB through secondary storage structures not shown of the two controller instances and .

The control layer of the controller instance then detects the addition of these records to the NIB and processes the records to generate or modify other records in the NIB . In particular the control layer generates LFP data. The virtualization layer in turn detects the modification and or addition of these records in the NIB and modifies and or generates other records in the NIB. These records represent the UPCP data in this example. These records then get sent to another controller instance that is managing at least one switching element that implements the particular LDPS.

The controller instance in this example is a controller instance that is managing the switching element . The switching element implements at least part of the particular LDPS. The NOS of the controller instance receives the records representing the UPCP data from the NOS of the controller instance . In some embodiments the customization layer performs a conversion of the UPCP data to the CPCP data and pushes the CPCP data to the NIB . The NOS of the controller instance then pushes the CPCP data to the managed switching element .

In some embodiments the controller instance just identifies a set of managed switching elements to which to send the received UPCP data and relays the UPCP data to the identified managed switching elements. The managed switching elements will perform the conversion of the UPCP data into the CPCP data. In this manner the controller instance functions as an aggregation point to gather data to send to the managed switching elements that this controller instance is responsible for managing. In this example the managed switching element is one of the switching elements managed by the controller instance .

In some embodiments the controller instances exchange API calls that specify requests for information inquires differently than the API calls that specify requests for configuring the LDPS. For instance the controller instances do not use the NIBs and NOS to send data records from one controller instance to another controller instance. Specifically in this example the controller instances establish communication channels e.g. RPC channels between them and exchange the data records that are translated from the API calls that specify the requests for information inquires over these channels without relying on the NIBs and NOS of the controller instances.

In some embodiments the input translation application supports a set of API calls for specifying LDP sets and information inquires. In these embodiments the user interface application that allows the user to enter input values sends the inputs in the form of API calls to the input translation application . These API calls specify the LDPS e.g. logical switch configuration specified by the user and the user s information inquiry e.g. network traffic statistics for the logical ports of the logical switch of the user . Also the input translation application may get inputs from logical controllers physical controllers and or physical controllers as well as from another controller in which another input translation application runs in some embodiments.

The input parser of some embodiments receives inputs in the form of API calls from the user interface application. In some embodiments the input parser extracts the user input values from the API calls and passes the input values to the filter . The filter filters out the input values that do not conform to certain requirements. For instance the filter filters out the input values that specify an invalid network address for a logical port. For those API calls that contain non conforming input values the response manager sends a response to the user indicating the inputs do no conform.

The request generator generates requests to be sent to one or more controller instances. As mentioned above a first type of request is for configuring a particular LDPS e.g. configuring a logical switching element or a logical router to be implemented in a set of managed switching elements and a second type of request is for information inquires e.g. network traffic statistics for the logical ports of the logical switch of the user . The request generator deposits the generated requests in the requests repository .

The request generator of different embodiments generates requests according to different formats depending on the types of request. For instance when the requests specify configuration of the LDPS e.g. LCP data the request generator of some embodiments generates such requests in the form of records e.g. data tuples . When the requests specify information inquiries the request generator of some embodiments generates such requests in the form of the remote procedure calls.

The dispatcher retrieves the generated requests. The dispatcher then either updates the NIB with the requests or sends the requests to the appropriate controller instances. In some embodiments the dispatcher publishes the records containing the requests for configuring the particular LDPS to the NIB from which the NOS propagates the records to several other controller instances e.g. logical controller . This data propagation from the NIB can be achieved through any of the different ways described above by reference to .

For the requests that specify information inquires the dispatcher of some embodiments identifies the controller instance to which each request should be sent. In some cases the dispatcher looks at the LDPS associated with the request and identifies a controller instance that is the master of that LDPS. In some cases the dispatcher identifies a master of a particular switching element e.g. a physical controller as a controller instance to send the request when the request is specifically related to a managed switching element e.g. when the request is about statistical information of a logical port that is mapped to a port of the managed switching element . The dispatcher sends the request to the identified controller instance using the inter controller communication interface . The inter controller communication interface establishes a communication channel e.g. an RPC channel with each of the other controller instances to facilitate data exchange e.g. requests and responses with other controllers.

When the receiving controller instances receive requests that specify information inquires the controller instances process the requests and produce responses containing inquired information. The response manager receives the responses from the controller instances that processed requests through the channel s established by the inter controller communication interface . In some cases more than one response may return for a request that was sent out. For instance a request for statistical information from all logical ports of the logical switching element that the user is managing would return a response from each controller. The responses from multiple physical controller instances for multiple different switching elements whose ports are mapped to the logical ports may return to the input translation application either directly to the input translation application or through the master of the LDPS associated with the logical switch. In such cases the response manager of some embodiments merges those responses and sends a single merged response to the user interface application.

As shown in the process initially receives at data regarding an input event. The input event data may be logical data supplied by an input translation application that distributes the input event data to different controller instances. An example of user supplied data could be LCP data including access control list data for a logical switch that the user manages. The input event data may also be LFP data that the control application generates in some embodiments from the LCP data. The input event data in some embodiments may also be UPCP data received from the virtualization application.

At the process then performs a filtering operation to determine whether this instance of the control application is responsible for the input event data. As described above several instances of the control application may operate in parallel in several different controller instances to control multiple LDP sets in some embodiments. In these embodiments each control application uses the filtering operation to filter out input data that does not relate to the LDPS that the control application is not responsible for managing. To perform this filtering operation the control application of some embodiments includes a filter module. This module of some embodiments is a standalone module while in other embodiments it is implemented by a table mapping engine e.g. implemented by the join operations performed by the table mapping engine such as an nLog table mapping engine that maps event data between input tables and output tables of the control application as further described below by reference to .

Next at the process determines whether the filtering operation has filtered out the input event data. The filtering operation filters out the input event data in some embodiments when the input event data does not fall within one of the LDP sets that the control application is responsible for managing. When the process determines at that the filtering operation has filtered out the input event data the process ends. Otherwise the process transitions to .

At the process generates data tuples based on the filtered input event data. A converter of the control application in some embodiments generates one or more sets of data tuples based on the received input event data. In some embodiments the converter is a table mapping engine that performs a series of table mapping operations on the input event data to map the input event data to other data tuples to modify existing data or generate new data. As mentioned above this table mapping engine also performs the filtering operation in some embodiments. One example of such a table mapping engine is an nLog table mapping engine which will be described below by reference to .

In some embodiments the data tuples that the process generates may include data that the process has to push down to the NIB e.g. LFP data . Accordingly at the process publishes to the NIB any data tuples that it has generated if such publication is necessary. After the process ends.

The control application in some embodiments performs its mapping operations by using the nLog table mapping engine which is a variation of the datalog table mapping technique. illustrates a control application of some embodiments of the invention. This application uses an nLog table mapping engine to map input tables that contain input data tuples to LDPS data tuples. This application resides on top of a virtualization application that receives the LDPS data tuples from the control application in some embodiments. The virtualization application also functions as a virtualization layer of a controller instance in some embodiments. The virtualization application maps the LDPS data tuples to data tuples for defining UPCP data. The virtual application resides on top of a NOS that contains a NIB that stores the data tuples generated by the virtualization application .

In some embodiments the control application is executed on the same machine with the virtualization application and the NOS. However the control application the virtualization application and the NOS do not have to run on the same machine in other embodiments. That is one of these applications or each of these applications may run on a different computer.

As shown in the control application includes a set of rule engine input tables a set of function and constant tables a query manager a rules engine a set of rule engine output tables a NIB monitor a publisher and a compiler . The compiler is one component of the application that operates at a different instance in time than the application s other components. The compiler operates when a developer needs to specify the rules engine for a particular control application and or virtualized environment whereas the rest of the application s modules operate at run time when the application interfaces with the control application and the NOS to deploy and monitor LDP sets specified by one or more users.

In some embodiments the compiler takes a relatively small set e.g. few hundred lines of declarative instructions that are specified in a declarative language and converts these into a large set e.g. thousands of lines of code that specify the operation of the rules engine which performs the application s table mapping. As such the compiler greatly simplifies the control application developer s process of defining and updating the control application. This is because the compiler allows the developer to use a high level programming language that allows a compact definition of the control application s complex mapping operation and to subsequently update this mapping operation in response to any number of changes e.g. changes in the logical networking functions supported by the control application changes to desired behavior of the control application etc. .

In some embodiments the rule engine RE input tables include tables with logical data and or switching configurations e.g. access control list configurations private virtual network configurations port security configurations etc. specified by the user through the input translation application and or the control application . In some embodiments the input tables also include tables that contain physical data from the switching elements managed by the network control system. In some embodiments such physical data includes data regarding the managed switching elements e.g. UPCP data and CPCP data and other data regarding network configuration employed by the network control system to deploy the different LDPS of the different users.

The RE input tables are partially populated by the LDPS data e.g. LCP data provided by the user. The control application of some embodiments receives the LDPS data from the input translation application through a communication channel e.g. RPC channel . The control application also generates part of the LDPS data e.g. LFP data and physical i.e. non logical data e.g. physical control plane data by monitoring the NIB to identify changes in the managed switching element infrastructure that would require modification to the LDPS data and or the physical data.

In addition to the RE input tables the control application includes other miscellaneous tables that the rules engine uses to gather inputs for its table mapping operations. These tables include constant tables that store defined values for constants that the rules engine needs to perform its table mapping operations.

When the rules engine references constants the corresponding value defined for the constants are actually retrieved and used. In addition the values defined for constants in the constant table may be modified and or updated. In this manner the constant table provides the ability to modify the value defined for constants that the rules engine references without the need to rewrite or recompile code that specifies the operation of the rules engine .

The tables further include function tables that store functions that the rules engine needs to use to calculate values needed to populate the output tables . One example of such a function is a hash function that the rules engine uses to compute hash values for distributing distributed hash table DHT operations as well as load balancing traffic between lower level switches and higher level switches in a hierarchical switching architecture.

The rules engine performs table mapping operations that specify one manner for converting any LDPS within the LCP to a LDPS in the LFP. Whenever one of the rule engine RE input tables is modified the rules engine performs a set of table mapping operations that may result in the modification of one or more data tuples in one or more RE output tables. The modification of the output table data tuples in turn through the virtualization application may cause the NIB to be modified in order to establish and or modify the implementation of a particular user s LDPS in the managed switching element infrastructure.

As shown in the rules engine includes an event processor several query plans and a table processor . Each query plan is a set of rules that specify a set of join operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of a modification to one of the RE input table. Such a modification is referred to below as an input table event. In this example each query plan is generated by the compiler from one declaratory rule in the set of declarations . In some embodiments more than one query plan is generated from one declaratory rule. In some embodiments the query plans are defined by using the nLog declaratory language.

In some embodiments the compiler does not just statically generate query plans but rather dynamically generates query plans based on performance data it gathers. The complier in these embodiments generates an initial set of query plans and lets the rules engine operate with the initial set of query plans. The control application gathers the performance data or receives performance feedbacks e.g. from the rules engine . Based on this data the compiler is modified so that the control application or a user of this application can have the modified compiler modify the query plans while the rules engine is not operating or during the operation of the rules engine.

For instance the order of the join operations in a query plan may result in different execution times depending on the number of tables the rules engine has to select to perform each join operation. The compiler in these embodiments can be re specified in order to re order the join operations in a particular query plan when a certain order of the join operations in the particular query plan has resulted in a long execution time to perform the join operations.

The event processor of the rules engine detects the occurrence of each input table event. The event processor of different embodiments detects the occurrence of an input table event differently. In some embodiments the event processor registers for callbacks with the RE input tables for notification of changes to the records of the RE input tables. In such embodiments the event processor detects an input table event when it receives notification from a RE input table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected input table event the event processor 1 selects the appropriate query plan for the detected table event and 2 directs the table processor to execute the query plan. To execute the query plan the table processor in some embodiments performs the join operations specified by the query plan to produce one or more records that represent one or more sets of data values from one or more input and miscellaneous tables and . The table processor of some embodiments then 1 performs a select operation to select a subset of the data values from the record s produced by the join operations and 2 writes the selected subset of data values in one or more RE output tables .

In some embodiments the RE output tables store both logical and physical network element data attributes. The tables are called RE output tables as they store the output of the table mapping operations of the rules engine . In some embodiments the RE output tables can be grouped in several different categories. For instance in some embodiments these tables can be RE input tables and or control application CA output tables. A table is a RE input table when a change in the table causes the rules engine to detect an input event that requires the execution of a query plan. A RE output table can also be a RE input table that generates an event that causes the rules engine to perform another query plan. Such an event is referred to as an internal input event and it is to be contrasted with an external input event which is an event that is caused by a RE input table modification made by the control application or the NIB monitor .

A table is a CA output table when a change in the table causes the publisher to publish a change to the virtualization application and or to the NIB as further described below. A table in the RE output tables can be a RE input table a CA output table or both a RE input table and a CA output table in some embodiments.

The publisher detects changes to the CA output tables of the RE output tables . The publisher of different embodiments detects the occurrence of a CA output table event differently. In some embodiments the publisher registers for callbacks with the CA output tables for notification of changes to the records of the CA output tables. In such embodiments the publisher detects an output table event when it receives notification from a CA output table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected output table event the publisher takes some or all of modified data tuples in the modified CA output tables and propagates this modified data tuple s to the input tables not shown of the virtualization application . In some embodiments instead of the publisher pushing the data tuples to the virtualization application the virtualization application pulls the data tuples from the CA output tables into the input tables of the virtualization application. Alternatively in some embodiments the publisher publishes changes to the modified CA output tables to the NIB and the virtualization application retrieves these changes from the NIB and based on them modifies its input tables. In some embodiments the CA output tables of the control application and the input tables of the virtualization may be identical. In yet other embodiments the control and virtualization applications use one set of tables so that the CA output tables are essentially virtualization application VA input tables.

Moreover the publisher in some embodiments takes some or all of modified data tuples in the modified CA output tables and propagates this modified data tuple into the NIB through the APIs provided by the NOS . Also the publisher may push down logical data e.g. LCP data LFP data etc. processed and maintained by the control application to the NIB . This is because in some embodiments the NIB serves as a medium for all communications between the control application the virtualization application and the NOS of different controller instances as described above by reference to .

As the CA output tables store both logical and physical network element data attributes in some embodiments the NIB in some embodiments stores both logical and physical network element attributes that are identical to or derived by the virtualization application from the logical and physical network element data attributes in the output tables . In other embodiments however the NIB only stores physical network element attributes that are identical to or derived by the virtualization application from the physical network element data attributes in the output tables .

The NIB monitor interfaces with the NIB to receive notifications regarding changes to the NIB. The NIB monitor of different embodiments detects the occurrence of a change in the NIB differently. In some embodiments the NIB monitor registers for callbacks with the NIB for notification of changes to one or more records in the NIB. In such embodiments the NIB monitor detects a NIB change event when it receives notification from the NIB that one of its records has changed. In response to a detected NIB change event the NIB monitor may modify one or more RE input tables which in turn may cause one or more RE input table events to occur that then initiates the execution of one or more query plans by the rules engine. In other words the NIB monitor writes some or all of the information that it receives from the NIB into the input tables so that the state and configuration of the managed switching elements can be accounted for while generating the NIB data tuples through the mapping operations. Each time the managed switching configuration or underlying managed switching element state changes the NIB monitor may update the input table records so that the generated NIB data tuples can be updated to reflect the modified switching configuration or underlying switching element state.

In some embodiments the NIB monitor is a collection of input objects or functions associated with the RE input tables. Each input object in some embodiments is associated with one RE input table and is responsible for modifying its associated RE input table in response to a change in the NIB. Each input object in some embodiments registers with one or more NIB objects for callback notifications upon the occurrence of changes to the NIB object s . Similarly in some embodiments the publisher is a collection of output objects or functions associated with the CA output tables. Each output object in some embodiments is associated with one CA output table and is responsible for propagating changes in its associated output table to the virtualization application . As such in some embodiments the NIB monitor is a conceptual representation of the input and output objects that register with the NIB for callbacks.

The query manager uses an inter controller communication interface not shown to interface with the control application to receive queries e.g. information inquires regarding LDPS data and to send the responses to the input translation application. In some embodiments these queries originate from the input translation application which receives these queries from the user. As shown in the query manager of some embodiments also interfaces with the NIB in order to query the NIB to provide the control application state information regarding the network elements in the LDPS for the different users. In other embodiments however the query manager queries the output tables to obtain LDPS data for the control application.

At the process then performs a filtering operation to determine whether this instance of the virtualization application is responsible for the input event data. As described above several instances of the virtualization application may operate in parallel to control multiple sets of LDP sets in some embodiments. In these embodiments each virtualization application uses the filtering operation to filter out input data that does not relate to the virtualization application s LDP sets. Also the virtualization application of some embodiments filters out input data that does not relate to the managed switching elements that this instance of the virtualization application is responsible for managing.

To perform this filtering operation the virtualization application of some embodiments includes a filter module. This module in some embodiments is a standalone module while in other embodiments it is implemented by a table mapping engine e.g. implemented by the join operations performed by the table mapping engine such as an nLog table mapping engine that maps records between input tables and output tables of the virtualization application as further described below by reference to .

Next at the process determines whether the filtering operation has filtered out the received input event data. As mentioned above the instance of the virtualization application filters out the input data when the input data is related to a LDPS that is not one of the LDP sets of which the virtualization application is the master or when the data is for a managed switching element that is not one of the managed switching elements of which the virtualization application is the master. When the process determines at that the filtering operation has filtered out the input event the process ends. Otherwise the process transitions to .

At the process generates data tuples based on the filtered input event data. A converter of the virtualization application in some embodiments generates one or more sets of data tuples based on the received input event data. In some embodiments the converter is a table mapping engine that performs a series of table mapping operations on the input event data to map the input event data to other data tuples. As mentioned above this table mapping engine also performs the filtering operation in some embodiments. One example of such a table mapping engine is an nLog table mapping engine which will be further described further below by reference to .

In some embodiments the data tuples that the process generates may include data that the process has to push down to the NIB e.g. LFP data . Accordingly at the process publishes to the NIB any data tuples that it has generated if such publication is necessary. After the process ends.

More specifically the control application allows different users to define different LDP sets which specify the desired configuration of the logical switches that the users manage. The control application through its mapping operations converts data for each LDPS of each user into a set of data tuples that specify the LFP data for the logical switch associated with the LDPS. In some embodiments the control application is executed on the same host on which the virtualization application is executed. The control application and the virtualization application do not have to run on the same machine in other embodiments.

As shown in the virtualization application includes a set of rule engine input tables a set of function and constant tables an query manager a rules engine a set of rule engine output tables a translator an NIB publisher a PTD and a compiler .

The compiler is similar to the compiler described above by reference to . In some embodiments the rule engine RE input tables include tables with logical data and or switching configurations e.g. access control list configurations private virtual network configurations port security configurations etc. specified by the user and or the virtualization application. In some embodiments the input tables also include tables that contain physical data i.e. non logical data from the switching elements managed by the network control system. In some embodiments such physical data includes data regarding the managed switching elements e.g. UPCP data and CPCP data and other data regarding network configuration employed by the network control system to deploy the different LDP sets of the different users.

In order for the virtualization application to map the LDPS data tuples to UPCP data tuples the developer in some embodiments specifies in a declarative language the declarative instructions which include the instructions for mapping the LDPS data tuples to UPCP data tuples for some managed switching elements. In some such embodiments these switching elements include UPCPs to convert the UPCP data to the CPCP data.

For other managed switching elements the virtualization application maps the LDPS data tuples to CPCP data tuples that are specific to each managed switching elements that do not have UPCPs. In some embodiments when the virtualization application receives UPCP data from the virtualization application of another controller instance the virtualization application further maps the UPCP data tuples in the output tables to the CPCP data tuples for some managed switching elements that do not have UPCPs to convert the UPCP data tuples to the physical datapath set data tuples.

In some embodiments when there is a chassis controller to convert the UPCP data tuples into the CPCP data specific to a particular managed switching element the virtualization application does not convert input UPCP data into the CPCP data for the particular managed switching element. In these embodiments the controller instance that has the virtualization application identifies a set of managed switching elements of which the controller instance is the master and distributes the UPCP data to the set of managed switching elements.

The RE input tables are partially populated by the LDPS data e.g. by LFP data provided by the control application . The control application generates part of the LDPS data based on user input regarding the LDP sets.

In addition to the RE input tables the virtualization application includes other miscellaneous tables that the rules engine uses to gather inputs for its table mapping operations. These tables include constant tables that store defined values for constants that the rules engine needs to perform its table mapping operations.

When the rules engine references constants the corresponding value defined for the constants are actually retrieved and used. In addition the values defined for constants in the constant table may be modified and or updated. In this manner the constant tables provide the ability to modify the value defined for constants that the rules engine references without the need to rewrite or recompile code that specifies the operation of the rules engine . The tables further include function tables that store functions that the rules engine needs to use to calculate values needed to populate the output tables .

The rules engine performs table mapping operations that specify one manner for implementing the LDP sets within the managed switching element infrastructure. Whenever one of the RE input tables is modified the rules engine performs a set of table mapping operations that may result in the modification of one or more data tuples in one or more RE output tables.

As shown in the rules engine includes an event processor several query plans and a table processor . In some embodiments each query plan is a set of join operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of a modification to one of the RE input tables. Such a modification is referred to below as an input table event. In this example each query plan is generated by the compiler from one declaratory rule in the set of declarations . In some embodiments more than one query plan is generated from one declaratory rule as described above. In some embodiments the query plans are defined by using the nLog declaratory language.

The event processor of the rules engine detects the occurrence of each input table event. The event processor of different embodiments detects the occurrence of an input table event differently. In some embodiments the event processor registers for callbacks with the RE input tables for notification of changes to the records of the RE input tables. In such embodiments the event processor detects an input table event when it receives notification from an RE input table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected input table event the event processor 1 selects the appropriate query plan for the detected table event and 2 directs the table processor to execute the query plan. To execute the query plan the table processor in some embodiments performs the join operations specified by the query plan to produce one or more records that represent one or more sets of data values from one or more input and miscellaneous tables and . The table processor of some embodiments then 1 performs a select operation to select a subset of the data values from the record s produced by the join operations and 2 writes the selected subset of data values in one or more RE output tables .

In some embodiments the RE output tables store both logical and physical network element data attributes. The tables are called RE output tables as they store the output of the table mapping operations of the rules engine . In some embodiments the RE output tables can be grouped in several different categories. For instance in some embodiments these tables can be RE input tables and or virtualization application VA output tables. A table is an RE input table when a change in the table causes the rules engine to detect an input event that requires the execution of a query plan. A RE output table can also be an RE input table that generates an event that causes the rules engine to perform another query plan after it is modified by the rules engine. Such an event is referred to as an internal input event and it is to be contrasted with an external input event which is an event that is caused by an RE input table modification made by the control application or the NIB monitor .

A table is a VA output table when a change in the table causes the NIB publisher to publish a change to the NIB . In some embodiments a table in the RE output tables can be an RE input table a VA output table or both an RE input table and a VA output table in some embodiments.

The NIB publisher detects changes to the VA output tables of the RE output tables . The NIB publisher of different embodiments detects the occurrence of a VA output table event differently. In some embodiments the NIB publisher registers for callbacks with the VA output tables for notification of changes to the records of the VA output tables. In such embodiments the NIB publisher detects an output table event when it receives notification from a VA output table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected output table event the NIB publisher takes each modified data tuple in the modified VA output tables and propagates this modified data tuple into the NIB through the APIs provided by the NOS . After a new data tuple is propagated to the NIB by the NIB publisher the NOS propagates if needed a NIB data tuple that was modified because of the propagated VA output table data tuple to one or more of the managed switching elements. In doing this the NOS completes the deployment of the LDPS e.g. one or more logical switching configurations to one or more managed switching elements as specified by the NIB records.

As the VA output tables store both logical and physical network element data attributes in some embodiments the NIB in some embodiments stores both logical and physical network element attributes that are identical to or derived from the logical and physical network element data attributes in the output tables . In other embodiments however the NIB only stores physical network element attributes that are identical to or derived from the physical network element data attributes in the output tables .

The NIB monitor interfaces with the NIB to receive notifications regarding changes to the NIB. The NIB monitor of different embodiments detects the occurrence of a change in the NIB differently. In some embodiments the NIB monitor registers for callbacks with the NIB for notification of changes to one or more records in the NIB. In such embodiments the NIB monitor detects a NIB change event when it receives notification from the NIB that one of its records has changed. In response to a detected NIB change event the NIB monitor may modify one or more RE input tables which in turn may cause one or more RE input table events to occur that then initiates the execution of one or more query plans by the rules engine. In other words the NIB monitor writes some or all of the information that it receives from the NIB into the input tables so that the state and configuration of the managed switching elements can be accounted for while generating the NIB data tuples through the mapping operations. Each time the managed switching configuration or underlying managed switching element state changes the NIB monitor may update the input table records so that the generated NIB data tuples can be updated to reflect the modified switching configuration or underlying switching element state.

In some embodiments the NIB monitor is a collection of input objects or functions associated with the RE input tables. Each input object in some embodiments is associated with one RE input table and is responsible for modifying its associated input table in response to a change in the NIB. Each input object in some embodiments registers with one or more NIB objects for callback notifications upon the occurrence of changes to the NIB object s . Similarly in some embodiments the NIB publisher is a collection of output objects or functions associated with the VA output tables. Each output object in some embodiments is associated with one VA output table and is responsible for propagating changes in its associated output table to the NIB. As such in some embodiments the NIB monitor is a conceptual representation of the input and output objects that register with the NIB for callbacks.

The query manager of some embodiments uses an inter controller communication interface to interfaces with an input translation application not shown to receive queries e.g. information inquires regarding LDPS data and send responses to the input translation application. As shown in the manager of some embodiments also interfaces with the NIB in order to query the NIB to provide the virtualization application state information e.g. responses to requests that specify information inquires originated from the user regarding the network elements in the LDPS for the different user. In other embodiments however the query manager queries the output tables to obtain LDPS data for the control application.

In some embodiments an instance of the virtualization application of a logical controller generates UPCP data and passes it to another instance of the virtualization application of a physical controller. In some such embodiments the virtualization application instance of the physical controller does not convert the UPCP data into the CPCP data for those managed switching elements that has chassis controllers for converting the UPCP data into the CPCP data specific to the switching elements.

In some embodiments a chassis controller is a controller for managing a single managed switching element. A chassis controller of some embodiments does not have a full stack of different modules and interfaces described above by reference to . One of the modules that a chassis controller does have is a chassis control application that generates CPCP data from UPCP data it receives from one or more physical controllers. illustrates an example architecture for a chassis control application . This application uses an nLog table mapping engine to map input tables that contain input data tuples that represent UPCP data to data tuples that represent the LFP data. This application manages the managed switching element in this example by exchanging data with the managed switching element . In some embodiments the application i.e. the chassis controller runs in the same machine in which the managed switching element is running.

As shown in the chassis control application includes a set of rule engine input tables a set of function and constant tables a query manager a rules engine a set of rule engine output tables an NIB publisher a managed switching element communication interface and a compiler . This figure also illustrates a physical controller and a managed switching element .

The compiler is similar to the compilers of the control application or the virtualization application described above by reference to . In some embodiments the rule engine RE input tables include tables with universal physical data and or switching configurations e.g. access control list configurations private virtual network configurations port security configurations etc. that the physical controller that is master of the managed switching element sent to the chassis control application . The input tables also include tables that contain physical data i.e. non logical data from the managed switching element . In some embodiments such physical data includes data regarding the managed switching element e.g. CPCP data physical forwarding data and other data regarding the configuration of the managed switching element .

The input tables are partially populated by the UPCP data provided by the physical controller . The physical controller of some embodiments receives the UPCP data from one or more logical controllers not shown .

In addition to the input tables the chassis control application includes other miscellaneous tables that the rules engine uses to gather inputs for its table mapping operations. These tables include constant tables that store defined values for constants that the rules engine needs to perform its table mapping operations.

When the rules engine references constants the corresponding value defined for the constants are actually retrieved and used. In addition the values defined for constants in the constant table may be modified and or updated. In this manner the constant tables provide the ability to modify the value defined for constants that the rules engine references without the need to rewrite or recompile code that specifies the operation of the rules engine . The tables further include function tables that store functions that the rules engine needs to use to calculate values needed to populate the output tables .

The rules engine performs table mapping operations that specify one manner for implementing the LDP sets within the managed switching element . Whenever one of the RE input tables is modified the rules engine performs a set of table mapping operations that may result in the modification of one or more data tuples in one or more RE output tables.

As shown in the rules engine includes an event processor several query plans and a table processor . In some embodiments each query plan is a set of join operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of a modification to one of the RE input table. Such a modification is referred to below as an input table event. Each query plan is generated by the compiler from one declaratory rule in the set of declarations . In some embodiments more than one query plan is generated from one declaratory rule as described above. In some embodiments the query plans are defined by using the nLog declaratory language.

The event processor of the rules engine detects the occurrence of each input table event. The event processor of different embodiments detects the occurrence of an input table event differently. In some embodiments the event processor registers for callbacks with the input tables for notification of changes to the records of the input tables. In such embodiments the event processor detects an input table event when it receives notification from an input table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected input table event the event processor 1 selects the appropriate query plan for the detected table event and 2 directs the table processor to execute the query plan. To execute the query plan the table processor in some embodiments performs the join operations specified by the query plan to produce one or more records that represent one or more sets of data values from one or more input and miscellaneous tables and . The table processor of some embodiments then 1 performs a select operation to select a subset of the data values from the record s produced by the join operations and 2 writes the selected subset of data values in one or more output tables .

In some embodiments the RE output tables store both logical and physical network element data attributes. The tables are called RE output tables as they store the output of the table mapping operations of the rules engine . In some embodiments the RE output tables can be grouped in several different categories. For instance in some embodiments these tables can be RE input tables and or chassis controller application CCA output tables. A table is an RE input table when a change in the table causes the rules engine to detect an input event that requires the execution of a query plan. A RE output table can also be an RE input table that generates an event that causes the rules engine to perform another query plan after it is modified by the rules engine. Such an event is referred to as an internal input event and it is to be contrasted with an external input event which is an event that is caused by an RE input table modification made by the control application or the NIB monitor . A table is a CCA output table when a change in the table causes the NIB publisher to push a change to the NIB .

The NIB publisher detects changes to the CCA output tables of the RE output tables . The NIB publisher of different embodiments detects the occurrence of a CCA output table event differently. In some embodiments the NIB publisher registers for callbacks with the CCA output tables for notification of changes to the records of the CCA output tables. In such embodiments the NIB publisher detects an output table event when it receives notification from a CCA output table that one of its records has changed.

In response to a detected output table event the NIB publisher takes each modified data tuple in the modified CCA output tables and propagates this modified data tuple into the NIB through the APIs provided by the NOS . After a new data tuple is propagated to the NIB by the NIB publisher the NOS propagates if needed a NIB data tuple that was modified because of the propagated CCAA output table data tuple to the managed switching element . In doing this the NOS completes the deployment of the LDPS e.g. one or more logical switching configurations to the managed switching element .

Because the chassis controller application of some embodiments is for managing only the managed switching element the records stored in the NIB are only about the managed switching element . The NIB of some embodiments stores both logical and physical data for the managed switching element to perform logical and physical processing on the packets that the managed switching element processes.

The query manager of some embodiments uses an inter controller interface not shown to interface with the physical controller or an input translation application not shown to receive queries e.g. information inquirers regarding LDPS data and send the responses to the physical controller or the input translation application. As shown in the manager of some embodiments also interfaces with the NIB in order to query the NIB to provide the physical controller with state information regarding the network elements in the LDPS for the different user. In other embodiments however the query manager queries the output tables to obtain LDPS data for the physical controller.

The NOS of the chassis controller of some embodiments establishes two channels of communication. The NOS establishes a first of the two channels using a switching control protocol. One example of a switching control protocol is the OpenFlow protocol. The OpenFlow protocol in some embodiments is a communication protocol for controlling the forwarding plane e.g. forwarding tables of a switching element. For instance the OpenFlow protocol provides commands for adding flow entries to removing flow entries from and modifying flow entries in the managed switching element .

The NOS establishes a second of the two channels using a configuration protocol to send configuration information. In some embodiments configuration information includes information for configuring the managed switching element such as information for configuring ingress ports egress ports QoS configurations for ports tunnels etc.

The NOS receives updates in the managed switching element from the managed switching element over the two channels. The managed switching element of some embodiments sends updates to the chassis control application when there are changes with the flow entries or the configuration of the managed switching element not initiated by the chassis control application . Examples of such changes include failure of a machine that was connected to a port of the managed switching element a VM migration to the managed switching element etc.

In some embodiments the control application and the virtualization application use a variation of the datalog database language called nLog to create the table mapping engine that maps input tables containing logical datapath data and switching element attributes to the output tables. Like datalog nLog provides a few declaratory rules and operators that allow a developer to specify different operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of different events. In some embodiments nLog provides a smaller subset of the operators that are provided by datalog in order to increase the operational speed of nLog. For instance in some embodiments nLog only allows the AND operator to be used in any of the declaratory rules.

The declaratory rules and operations that are specified through nLog are then compiled into a much larger set of rules by an nLog compiler. In some embodiments this compiler translates each rule that is meant to respond to an event into several sets of database join operations. Collectively the larger set of rules forms the table mapping rules engine that is referred to below as the nLog engine.

One example of such a rule is illustrated in . This example is a multi conditional rule that specifies that an Action X has to be taken if four conditions A B C and D are true. The expression of each condition as true in this example is not meant to convey that all embodiments express each condition for each rule as True or False. For some embodiments this expression is meant to convey the concept of the existence of a condition which may or may not be true. For example in some such embodiments the condition A True might be expressed as Is variable Z A In other words A in this example is the value of a parameter Z and the condition is true when Z has a value A.

Irrespective of how the conditions are expressed a multi conditional rule in some embodiments specifies the taking of an action when certain conditions in the network are met. Examples of such actions include creation or deletion of new packet flow entries creation or deletion of new network constructs modification to use of existing network constructs etc. In the virtualization application these actions are often implemented by the rules engine by creating deleting or modifying records in the output tables which are then propagated to the NIB by the NIB publisher .

As shown in the multi conditional rule uses only the AND operator to express the rule. In other words each of the conditions A B C and D has to be true before the Action X is to be taken. In some embodiments the declaration toolkit only allows the developers to utilize the AND operator because excluding the other operators such as ORs XORs etc. that are allowed by datalog allows nLog to operate faster than datalog.

The compiler converts each rule specified by the declaration toolkit into a query plan of the rules engine. illustrates the creation of three query plans for three rules . Each query plan includes one or more sets of join operations. Each set of join operations specifies one or more join operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of a particular event in a particular RE input table where the particular event might correspond to the addition deletion or modification of an entry in the particular RE input table.

In some embodiments the compiler converts each multi conditional rule into several sets of join operations with each set of join operations being specified for execution upon the detection of the occurrence of one of the conditions. Under this approach the event for which the set of join operations is specified is one of the conditions of the multi conditional rule. Given that the multi conditional rule has multiple conditions the compiler in these embodiments specifies multiple sets of join operations to address the occurrence of each of the conditions.

These four sets of operations collectively represent the query plan that the rules engine performs upon the occurrence of a RE input table event relating to any of the parameters A B C or D. When the input table event relates to one of these parameters e.g. parameter B but one of the other parameters e.g. parameters A C and D is not true then the set of join operations fails and no output table is modified. But when the input table event relates to one of these parameters e.g. parameter B and all of the other parameters e.g. parameters A C and D are true then the set of join operations does not fail and an output table is modified to perform the action X. In some embodiments these join operations are internal join operations. In the example illustrated in each set of join operations terminates with a select command that selects entries in the record s resulting from the set of join operations to output to one or more output tables.

To implement the nLog engine in a distributed manner some embodiments partition management of LDP sets by assigning the management of each LDPS to one controller instance. This partition management of the LDPS is also referred to as serialization of management of the LDPS. The rules engine of some embodiments implements this partitioned management of the LDPS by having a join to the LDPS entry be the first join in each set of join operations that is not triggered by an event in a LDPS input table.

The four sets of join operations and are operational sets that are each to be performed upon the occurrence of one of the conditions A B C and D. The first join operation in each of these four sets and is a join with the LDPS table managed by the virtualization application instance. Accordingly even when the input table event relates to one of these four parameters e.g. parameter B and all of the other parameters e.g. parameters A C and D are true the set of join operations may fail if the event has occurred for a LDPS that is not managed by this virtualization application instance. The set of join operations does not fail and an output table is modified to perform the desire action only when 1 the input table event relates to one of these four parameters e.g. parameter B all of the other parameters e.g. parameters A C and D are true and 3 the event relates to a LDPS that is managed by this virtualization application instance.

As shown in the process initially detects at a change in a RE input table . In some embodiments the event processor is the module that detects this change. Next at the process identifies the query plan associated with the detected RE input table event. As mentioned above each query plan in some embodiments specifies a set of join operations that are to be performed upon the occurrence of an input table event. In some embodiments the event processor is also the module that performs this operation i.e. is the module that identifies the query plan .

At the process executes the query plan for the detected input table event. In some embodiments the event processor directs the table processor to execute the query plan. To execute a query plan that is specified in terms of a set of join operations the table processor in some embodiments performs the set of join operations specified by the query plan to produce one or more records that represent one or more sets of data values from one or more input and miscellaneous tables and .

Two records in two tables match when values of a common key e.g. a primary key and a foreign key that the two tables share are the same in some embodiments. In the example in the records and in tables and match because the values C in these records match. Similarly the records and in tables and match because the values F in these records match. Finally the records and in tables and match because the values R in these records match. The joining of the records and results in the combined record . In the example shown in the result of a join operation between two tables e.g. tables and is a single record e.g. ABCDFGH . However in some cases the result of a join operation between two tables may be multiple records.

Even though in the example illustrated in a record is produced as the result of the set of join operations the set of join operations in some cases might result in a null record. For instance as further described below a null record results when the set of join operations terminates on the first join because the detected event relates to a LDPS not managed by a particular instance of the virtualization application. Accordingly at the process determines whether the query plan has failed e.g. whether the set of join operations resulted in a null record . If so the process ends. In some embodiments the operation is implicitly performed by the table processor when it terminates its operations upon the failure of one of the join operations.

When the process determines at that the query plan has not failed it stores at the output resulting from the execution of the query plan in one or more of the output tables. In some embodiments the table processor performs this operation by 1 performing a select operation to select a subset of the data values from the record s produced by the join operations and 2 writing the selected subset of data values in one or more RE output tables . illustrates an example of this selection operation. Specifically it illustrates the selection of values B F P and S from the combined record and the writing of these values into a record of an output table .

As mentioned above the RE output tables can be categorized in some embodiments as 1 a RE input table only 2 a VA output table only or 3 both a RE input table and a VA output table. When the execution of the query plan results in the modification a VA output table the process publishes at the changes to this output table to the NIB. In some embodiments the NIB publisher detects changes to the VA output tables of the RE output tables and in response it propagates the modified data tuple in the modified VA output table into the NIB through the APIs provided by the NOS . After a new data tuple is propagated to the NIB by the NIB monitor the NOS propagates if needed a NIB data tuple that was modified because of the propagated VA output table data tuple to one or more of the managed switching elements. In doing this the NOS completes the deployment of the LDPS e.g. one or more logical switching configurations to one or more managed switching elements as specified by the NIB records.

At the process determines whether the execution of the query plan resulted in the modification of the RE input table. This operation is implicitly performed in some embodiments when the event processor determines that the output table that was modified previously at modified a RE input table. As mentioned above a RE output table can also be a RE input table that generates an event that causes the rules engine to perform another query plan after it is modified by the rules engine. Such an event is referred to as an internal input event and it is to be contrasted with an external input event which is an event that is caused by a RE input table modification made by the control application or the NIB monitor . When the process determines at that an internal input event was created it returns to to perform operations for this new internal input event. The process terminates when it determines at that the execution of the query plan at did not result in an internal input event.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that process is a conceptual representation of the operations used to map a change in one or more input tables to one or more output tables. The specific operations of process may not be performed in the exact order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. For instance the process in some embodiments batches up a set of changes in RE input tables and identifies at a query plan associated with the set of detected RE input table events. The process in these embodiments executes at the query plan for the whole set of the RE input table events rather than for a single RE input table event. Batching up the RE input table events in some embodiments results in better performance of the table mapping operations. For example batching the RE input table events improves performance because it reduces the number of instance that the process will produce additional RE input table events that would cause it to start another iteration of itself.

While may be described in terms of the control application and the virtualization application these figures have been described in terms of the virtualization application for simplicity of description.

As mentioned above some embodiments implement the nLog engine as a distributed table mapping engine that is executed by different control applications and virtualization applications of different controller instances. To implement the nLog engine in a distributed manner some embodiments partition the management of the LDP sets by specifying for each particular LDPS only one controller instance as the instance responsible for specifying the NIB records associated with that particular LDPS. Partitioning the management of the LDPS also assigns in some embodiments the table mapping operations for each LDPS to the nLog engine of the controller instance responsible for the LDPS.

As described above by reference to some embodiments partition the nLog table mapping operations across the different controller instances by designating the first join operation that is performed by each nLog instance to be based on the LDPS parameter. This designation ensures that each nLog instance s join operations fail and terminate immediately when the instance has started a set of join operations that relate to a LDPS that is not managed by the nLog instance.

In the example illustrated in the two query plans and are not executed because an input table event A has occurred for a LDPS and these two plans are not associated with such an event. Instead the two query plans and are executed because they are associated with the input table event A that has occurred. As shown in this figure the occurrence of this event results in two sets of join operations being performed to execute the two query plans and . The first set of join operations for the query plan fails because the query plan is specified for a LDPS which is a LDPS not managed by the virtualization application instance . This set of join operations fails on the first join operation because it is a join with the virtualization application instance s LDPS table which does not contain a record for the LDPS . In some embodiments even though the first join operation has failed the remaining join operations not shown of the query plan will still be performed and fail. In other embodiments the remaining join operations of the query plan will not be performed as shown.

The second set of join operations does not fail however because it is for the LDPS which is a LDPS managed by the virtualization application instance and therefore has a record in the LDPS table of this application instance. This set of join operations has four stages that each performs one join operation. Also as shown in the set of join operations terminates with a selection operation that selects a portion of the combined record produced through the join operations.

The distribution of the nLog table mapping operations across several nLog instances reduces the load on each nLog instance and thereby increases the speed by which each nLog instance can complete its mapping operations. illustrate an example that describes this reduction in workload. Specifically it illustrates an example where two controller instances and are responsible for the virtualization application functionality of two different LDPS A and B for different tenants A and B of a multi tenant computing environment. The two controller instances manage two sets of managed switching elements and . Each of the two sets of managed switching elements manages a set of machines or which may be host machines running on dedicated machines or may be virtual machines running on shared machines.

In four stages this figure illustrates the results of the table mapping operations that are performed by the virtualization applications of these two different controller instances. The first stage shows that no machines have been deployed in the managed system for either tenant A or tenant B. The second stage shows the computing environment with several machines that have been deployed for tenant A in the two sets of machines and . It also shows the VA output table of the virtualization application of the controller instance with flow entries for the LDPS A that were specified by this instance s virtualization application. The second stage further shows the NIB of the controller instance containing the flow entries for the LDPS A. At this stage the NIB also contains LDPS data relating to LDPS A in some embodiments but this data is not shown in .

The third stage in shows that the flow entries for the LDPS A have migrated to the NIB of the controller instance . This migration occurs because of the NIB replication across the controller instances. Also this replication causes LDPS data relating to LDPS A to be copied to the NIB . The third stage further shows the computing environment with several machines that have been deployed for tenant B in the two sets of machines and . It also shows the VA output table of the virtualization application of the controller instance with flow entries for the LDPS B that were specified by this instance s virtualization application. The third stage further shows the NIB of the controller instance containing the flow entries for the LDPS B. At this stage the NIB also contains LDPS data relating to LDPS B in some embodiments but this data is not shown in .

The fourth stage shows that the flow entries for the LDPS B have migrated to the NIB of the controller instance . This migration occurs because of the NIB replication across the controller instances. This replication also causes LDPS data relating to LDPS B to be copied to the NIB . As shown at the stage the NIBs and have LDPS data relating to both LDPS A and LDPS B. However the VA output tables of one controller instance do not store flow entries for the LDPS of another controller instance. That is in this example the VA output tables of controller instance A do not store the flow entries for the LDPS B and the VA output tables of controller instance B do not store the flow entries for the LDPS A. This depiction is meant to illustrate that some embodiments partition the storage of the logical state data across several controller instances. This allows these embodiments to keep the size of tables e.g. the input or output tables small in order to increase the speed by which each nLog instance can complete its mapping operations as described above.

While the input and output tables of each controller instance in some embodiments only store or practically only store logical state data for only the LDPS for which the controller instance is responsible the NIB for each controller instance in some of these embodiments contains all or practically all of the logical state data e.g. except some logical port statistics that are stored in the DHTs of controller instances that are not replicated across for all LDPS of all controller instances. However other embodiments will partition the logical state data for the LDPS s across the NIBs of different controller instances.

This figure further shows the NIB publisher receiving some or all of the input table records and publishing these records to the NIB . As further shown the NIB monitor receives NIB change notifications e.g. notifications of managed switching element changes detected by the NOS or notification of NIB changes pushed by the other controller instances in some embodiments and in response to such notifications it may update input and output tables and of the control application. In some embodiments the NIB monitor may write LCP data LFP data UPCP data or CPCP data to the input tables in response to NIB modification notifications.

The bottom half of also illustrates the table mapping operations of the virtualization application . As shown the virtualization application s input tables store LFP data UPCP data and CPCP data as the collection of all these data along with data in the constant and function tables not shown is used by the virtualization application s nLog engine in some embodiments to generate UPCP data and CPCP data from the input LFP data and UPCP data respectively.

This figure further shows the NIB publisher receiving some or all of the input table records and publishing these records to the NIB . As further shown the NIB monitor receives NIB change notifications in some embodiments and in response to such notification it may update input and output tables and of the virtualization application . In some embodiments the NIB monitor may write LFP UPCP and CPCP data in response to NIB modification notifications.

As mentioned above some of the logical or physical data that a NIB monitor pushes to the input tables of the control or virtualization application relates to data that is generated by other controller instances and passed to the NIB monitor s particular NIB e.g. through the secondary storage layer . For instance in some embodiments the logical data regarding logical constructs that relates to multiple LDPS might change and the NIB monitor may write this change to the input tables. Another example of such logical data that is produced by another controller instance in a multi controller instance environment occurs when a user provides LCP data for a particular LDPS on a first controller instance that is not responsible for the particular LDPS. This change request is added to the NIB request list such as the NIB request list which will be described above reference to of the first controller instance. This request list is then propagated across the NIBs of other controller instances by replication processes described above by reference to . The NOS of a second controller instance which is the master of the LDPS eventually makes the change to the NIB of the second controller instance based on the propagated request list. The NIB monitor of the second controller instance then writes the change to the one of the application s input tables e.g. the control application s input table . Accordingly in such cases the logical data that the NIB monitor writes to the input tables in some cases may originate from the NIB of another controller instance.

As mentioned above UPCP data that a NIB monitor pushes to the input tables of the control or virtualization application is UPCP data generated by other controller instances and passed to the NIB monitor s particular NIB e.g. through the secondary storage layer . For instance in some embodiments the UPCP data for a particular set of managed switching elements may be produced by the virtualization application of a logical controller i.e. master of an LDPS . The UPCP data produced by the logical controller is then replicated to the NIB of a second controller instance that is the master of at least one the particular set of managed switching elements. The second controller instance is therefore a physical controller responsible for managing the managed switching element. The NIB monitor of the second controller instance then writes the change to the one of the application s input tables e.g. the control application s input table . Accordingly the logical data that the NIB monitor writes to the input tables in some cases may originate from the NIB of another controller instance.

As mentioned above the control application and the virtualization application are two separate applications that operate on the same machine or different machines in some embodiments. Other embodiments however implement these two applications as two modules of one integrated application with the control application module generating LDPS in the LFP and the virtualization application generating physical datapath sets in the physical control plane or in the UPCP.

Still other embodiments integrate the control and virtualization operations of these two applications within one integrated application without separating these operations into two separate modules. illustrates an example of such an integrated application . This application uses an nLog table mapping engine to map data from an input set of tables to an output set of tables which like the above described embodiments and may include one or more tables in the input set of tables. The input set of tables in this integrated application may include LCP data that need to be mapped to LFP data or it may include LFP data that need to be mapped to CPCP or UPCP data or it may include UPCP data that need to be mapped to CPCP data.

In this integrated control and virtualization application a NIB publisher publishes input table records and output table records to the NIB . A NIB monitor then receives notification of changes from the NIB e.g. managed switching element changes detected by the NOS or NIB changes pushed by the other controller instances and for some notifications e.g. those relating to the LDPS for which the application is the master pushes changes to the input and or tables and .

In some embodiments each of the controllers in a network control system has a full stack of different modules and interfaces described above by reference to . However each controller does not have to use all the modules and interfaces in order to perform the functionalities given for the controller. Alternatively in some embodiments a controller in the system has only those modules and interfaces that are necessary to perform the functionalities given for the controller. For instance the logical controller which is a master of a LDPS does not include an input module e.g. an input translation application but does include the control module and the virtualization module e.g. a control application or a virtualization application or an integrated application to generate UPCP data from the input LCP data.

Moreover different combinations of different controllers may be running in a same machine. For instance the input translation controller and the logical controller may run in the same computing device. Also one controller may function differently for different LDP sets. For instance a single controller may be a master of a first LDPS and a master of a managed switching element that implements a second LDPS.

The input translation controller includes an input translation application such as the input translation application described above by reference to that generates LCP data from the inputs received from the user that specify a particular LDPS. The input translation controller identifies from the configuration data for the system the master of the LDPS. In this example the master of the LDPS is the logical controller . In some embodiments more than one controller can be masters of the same LDPS. Also one logical controller can be the master of more than one LDP sets.

The logical controller is responsible for the particular LDPS. The logical controller generates the UPCP data from the LCP data received from the input translation controller. Specifically the control module not shown of the logical controller generates the LFP data from the received LCP data and the virtualization module not shown of the logical controller generates the UPCP data from the logical forwarding data.

The logical controller identifies physical controllers that are masters of the managed switching elements that implement the LDPS. In this example the logical controller identifies the physical controllers and because the managed switching elements are configured to implement the LDPS in this example. The logical controller sends the generated UPCP data to the physical controllers and .

Each of the physical controllers and can be a master of one or more managed switching elements. In this example the physical controller is the master of two managed switching elements and and the physical controller is the master of the managed switching element . As the master of a set of managed switching elements the physical controllers of some embodiments generate from the received UPCP data CPCP data specific for each of the managed switching elements. Therefore in this example the physical controller generates the physical control plane data customized for each of the managed switching elements and . The physical controller generates physical control plane data customized for the managed switching element . The physical controllers send the customized physical control data to the managed switching elements of which the controllers are masters. In some embodiments multiple physical controllers can be the masters of the same managed switching elements.

In addition to sending CPCP data the physical controllers of some embodiments receive data from the managed switching elements. For instance a physical controller receives configuration information e.g. identifiers of VIFs of a managed switching element of the managed switching elements. The physical controller maintains the configuration information and also sends the information up to the logical controllers so that the logical controllers have the configuration information of the managed switching elements that implement the LDP sets of which the logical controllers are masters.

Each of the managed switching elements generates physical forwarding plane data from the CPCP data that the managed switching element received. As mentioned above the physical forwarding plane data defines the forwarding behavior of the managed switching element. In other words the managed switching element populates its forwarding table using the CPCP data. The managed switching elements forward data among the machines according to the forwarding tables.

The input translation controller is similar to the input translation controller in that the input translation controller includes an input translation application that generates LCP data from the inputs received from the user that specify a particular LDPS. The input translation controller identifies from the configuration data for the system the master of the LDPS. In this example the master of the LDPS is the logical controller .

The logical controller is similar to the logical controller in that the logical controller generates the UPCP data from the LCP data received from the input translation controller . The logical controller identifies physical controllers that are masters of the managed switching elements that implement the LDPS. In this example the logical controller identifies the physical controllers and because the managed switching elements are configured to implement the LDPS in this example. The logical controller sends the generated UPCP data to the physical controllers and .

Like the physical controllers and each physical controllers and can be a master of one or more managed switching elements. In this example the physical controller is the master of two managed switching elements and and the physical controller is the master of the managed switching element . However the physical controllers and do not generate CPCP data for the managed switching elements . As a master of managed switching elements the physical controller sends the UPCP data to the chassis controller that is responsible for each managed switching element of which the physical controller is the master. That is the physical controller of some embodiments identifies the chassis controllers that interface the managed switching elements of which the physical controller is master. In some embodiments the physical controller identifies those chassis controllers by determining whether the chassis controllers are subscribing to a channel of the physical controller.

A chassis controller of some embodiments has a one to one relationship with a managed switching element. The chassis controller receives UPCP data from the physical controller that is the master of the managed switching element and generates CPCP data specific for the managed switching element. The chassis controller in some embodiments runs in the same machine in which the managed switching element that the chassis controller manages runs while in other embodiments the chassis controller and the managed switching element run in different machines. In this example the chassis controller and the managed switching element run in the same computing device.

Like the managed switching elements each of the managed switching elements generates physical forwarding plane data from the CPCP data that the managed switching element received. The managed switching elements populate their respective forwarding tables using the CPCP data. The managed switching elements forward data among the machines according to the flow tables.

As mentioned above a managed switching element may implement more than one LDPS in some cases. In such cases the physical controller that is the master of such a managed switching element receives UPCP data for each of the LDP sets. Thus a physical controller in the network control system may be functioning as an aggregation point for relaying UPCP data for the different LDP sets for a particular managed switching element that implements the LDP sets to the chassis controllers.

Even though the chassis controllers illustrated in are a level above the managed switching elements the chassis controllers typically operate at the same level as the managed switching elements do because the chassis controllers of some embodiments within the managed switching elements or adjacent to the managed switching elements.

In some embodiments a network control system can have a hybrid of the network control systems and . That is in this hybrid network control system some of the physical controllers generate CPCP data for some of the managed switching elements and some of the physical controllers do not generate CPCP data for some of the managed switching elements. For the latter managed switching elements the hybrid system has chassis controllers to generate the CPCP data.

As shown in the first stage the logical switch forwards data between the VMs and . Specifically data comes to or from VM through a logical port 1 of the logical switch and data comes to or from VM through a logical port 2 of the logical switch . The logical switch is implemented by the managed switching element in this example. That is the logical port 1 is mapped to port 3 of the managed switching element and the logical port 2 is mapped to port 4 of the managed switching element .

The network control system in this example includes a controller cluster and two chassis controllers and . The controller cluster includes input translation controllers not shown logical controllers not shown and physical controllers not shown that collectively generate UPCP data based on the inputs that the controller cluster receives. The chassis controllers receive the UPCP data and customize the universal data into physical control plane data that is specific to the managed switching element that each chassis controller is managing. The chassis controllers and pass the CPCP data to the managed switching elements and respectively so that the managed switching elements and can generate physical forwarding plane data which the managed switching elements use to forward the data between the managed switching elements and .

At the second stage an administrator of the network that includes managed switching element creates VM in the host not shown in which the managed switching element runs. The administrator creates port 5 of the managed switching element and attaches VM to the port. Upon creation of port 3 the managed switching element of some embodiments sends the information about the newly created port to the controller cluster . In some embodiments the information may include port number network addresses e.g. IP and MAC addresses transport zone to which the managed switching element belongs machine attached to the port etc. As mentioned above this configuration information goes through the chassis controller managing the managed switching element and then through physical controllers and logical controllers all the way up to the user that manages the logical switch . To this user a new VM has become available to be added to the logical switch that the user is managing.

At stage the user in this example decides to use VM and attaches VM to the logical switch . As a result a logical port 6 of the logical switch is created. Data coming to or from VM therefore will go through the logical port 6. In some embodiments the controller cluster directs all the managed switching elements that implement the logical switch to create a tunnel between each pair of managed switching elements that has a pair of ports to which a pair of logical ports of the logical switch are mapped. In this example a tunnel can be established between managed switching elements and to facilitate data exchange between the logical port 1 and the logical port 6 i.e. between VMs and and between the logical port 2 and the logical port 6 i.e. between VMs and . That is data being exchanged between port 3 of the managed switching element and port 5 of the managed switching element and data being exchanged between port 4 of the managed switching element and port 5 of the managed switching element can go through the tunnel established between the managed switching elements and .

A tunnel between two managed switching elements is not needed to facilitate data exchange between the logical port 1 and the logical port 2 i.e. between VMs and because the logical port 1 and the logical port 2 are mapped onto two ports on the same managed switching element .

The third stage further shows that the controller cluster sends UPCP data specifying instructions to create a tunnel from the managed switching element to the managed switching element . In this example the UPCP data is sent to the chassis controller which will customize the UPCP data to physical control plane data specific to the managed switching element .

The fourth stage shows that the chassis controller sends the tunnel physical control plane data that specifies instructions to create a tunnel and to forward packets to the tunnel. The managed switching element creates a tunnel to the managed switching element based on the CPCP data. More specifically the managed switching element creates port 7 and establishes a tunnel e.g. GRE tunnel to port 8 of the managed switching element . More detailed operations to create a tunnel between two managed switching elements will be described below.

The process begins by receiving UPCP data from a logical controller or a physical controller. In some embodiments UPCP data have different types. One of the types of UPCP data is universal tunnel flow instructions which specify creation of a tunnel in a managed switching element and the use of the tunnel. In some embodiments the universal tunnel flow instructions include information about a port created in a managed switching element in a network. This port is a port of a managed switching element to which a user has mapped a logical port of the logical switch. This port is also a destination port which the tunneled data needs to reach. The information about the port includes 1 a transport zone to which the managed switching element that has the port belongs 2 a tunnel type which in some embodiments is based on tunnel protocols e.g. GRE CAPWAP etc. used to build a tunnel to the managed switching element that has the destination port and 3 a network address e.g. IP address of the managed switching element that has the destination port e.g. IP address of a VIF that will function as one end of the tunnel to establish .

Next the process determines at whether the received UPCP data is a universal tunnel flow instruction. In some embodiments the UPCP data specifies its type so that the process can determine the type of the received universal plane data. When the process determines at that the received universal data is not a universal tunnel flow instruction the process proceeds to to process the UPCP data to generate CPCP data and send the generated data to the managed switching element that the process is managing. The process then ends.

When the process determines at that the received UPCP data is the universal tunnel flow instructions the process proceeds to to parse the data to obtain the information about the destination port. The process then determines at whether the managed switching element that has the destination port is in the same transport zone in which the managed switching element that has a source port is. The managed switching element that has the source port is the managed switching element that the chassis controller that performs the process manages. In some embodiments a transport zone includes a group of machines that can communicate with each other without using a second level managed switching element such as a pool node.

In some embodiments the logical controller determines whether the managed switching element that has the destination port is in the same transport zone in which the managed switching element that has a source port is. The logical controller takes into account this determination in preparing the universal tunnel flow instructions to send via a physical controller to the chassis controller performing the process . Specifically the universal tunnel flow instructions will include different information for creating different tunnels. These different tunnel examples are described below after the description of . In these embodiments the process skips and proceeds to .

When the process determines at that the managed switching element with the source port and the managed switching element with the destination port are not in the same transport zone the process proceeds to which is described above. Otherwise the process proceeds to to customize the universal tunnel flow instructions and send the customized information to the managed switching element that has the source port. Customizing the universal tunnel flow instructions will be described in detail below. The process then ends.

The process begins by generating at instructions for creating a tunnel port. In some embodiments the process generates instructions for creating a tunnel port in the managed switching element that the controller manages based on the port information. The instructions include for example the type of tunnel to establish and the IP address of the NIC which will be the destination end of the tunnel. The tunnel port of the managed switching element managed by the controller will be the other end of the tunnel.

Next the process sends at the generated instructions for creating the tunnel port to the managed switching element that the controller manages. As mentioned above a chassis controller of some embodiments that directly interfaces with a managed switching element uses two channels to communicate with the managed switching element. One channel is a configuration channel to exchange configuration information with the managed switching element and the other channel is a switch control channel e.g. a channel established using OpenFlow protocol for exchanging flow entries and event data with the managed switching element. In some embodiments the process uses the configuration channel to send the generated instructions for creating the tunnel port to the managed switching element that the controller manages. Upon receiving the generated instructions the managed switching element of some embodiments creates the tunnel port in the managed switching element and establishes a tunnel between the tunnel port and a port of the managed switching element that has the destination port using a tunnel protocol specified by the tunnel type. When the tunnel port and the tunnel are created and established the managed switching element of some embodiments sends the value e.g. four of the identifier of the tunnel back to the controller instance.

The process of some embodiments then receives at the value of the identifier of the tunnel port e.g. tunnel port 4 through the configuration channel. The process then modifies a flow entry that is included in the universal tunnel flow instructions using this received value. This flow entry when sent to the managed switching element causes the managed switching element to perform an action. However being universal data this flow entry identifies the tunnel port by a universal identifier e.g. tunnel port and not by an actual port number. For instance this flow entry in the received universal tunnel flow instructions may be If destination destination machine s UUID send to tunnel port. The process creates at a flow entry with the value of the identifier of the tunnel port. Specifically the process replaces the identifier for the tunnel port with the actual value of the identifier that identifies the created port. For instance the modified flow entry would look like If destination destination machine s UUID send to 4. 

The process then sends at this flow entry to the managed switching element. In some embodiments the process sends this flow entry to the managed switching element over the switch control channel e.g. OpenFlow channel . The managed switching element will update its flow entries table using this flow entry. The managed switching element from then on forwards the data headed to a destination machine through the tunnel by sending the data to the tunnel port. The process then ends.

As shown the chassis controller includes input tables a rules engine output tables and a NIB which are similar to the input tables the rules engine the output tables and the NIB . The chassis controller manages the managed switching element . Two channels and are established between the NOS of the chassis controller and the managed switching element in some embodiment. The channel is for exchanging configuration data e.g. data about creating ports current status of the ports queues associated with the managed switching element etc. . The channel is an OpenFlow channel OpenFlow control channel over which to exchange flow entries in some embodiments.

The first stage shows that the chassis controller has updated the input tables using universal tunnel flow instructions received from a physical controller not shown . As shown the universal tunnel flow instructions include an instruction for creating a tunnel and a flow entry . As shown the instruction includes the type of the tunnel to be created and the IP addresses of the managed switching element that has the destination port. The flow entry specifies the action to take in terms of universal data that is not specific to the managed switching element . The rules engine performs table mapping operations onto the instruction and the flow entry .

The second stage shows the result of the table mapping operations performed by the rules engine . An instruction results from the instruction . In some embodiments the instructions and may be identical while they may not be in other embodiments. For instance the values in the instructions and that represent the tunnel type may be differ. The instruction includes the IP address and the type of the tunnel to be created among other information that may be included in the instruction . The flow entry did not trigger any table mapping operation and thus remains in the input tables .

The third stage shows that the instruction has been pushed to the managed switching element over the configuration channel . The managed switching element creates a tunnel port and establishes a tunnel between the managed switching element and another managed switching element that has the destination port. One end of the tunnel is the tunnel port created and the other end of the tunnel is the port that is associated with the destination IP address in some embodiments. The managed switching element of some embodiments uses the protocol specified by the tunnel type to establish the tunnel.

The fourth stage shows that the managed switching element has created a tunnel port port 1 in this example and a tunnel . This stage also shows that the managed switching element sends back the actual value of the tunnel port identifier. The managed switching element sends this information over the OpenFlow channel in this example. The information goes into the input tables as input event data via the NIB of the NOS and a NIB monitor not shown . The fifth stage shows that the input tables are updated with the information from the managed switching element . This update triggers the rules engine to perform table mapping operations.

The sixth stage shows the result of the table mapping operations performed at the previous stage . The output tables now has a flow entry that specifies the action to take in terms of information that is specific to the managed switching element . Specifically the flow entry specifies that when a packet s destination is the destination port the managed switching element should sent out the packet through port 1. The seventh stage shows that the flow entry has been pushed by the NOS to the managed switching element which will forward packets using the flow entry .

It is to be noted that the instruction and the data exchanged between the chassis controller and the managed switching element as shown in are conceptual representation of the universal tunnel flow instructions and the customized instructions and may not be in actual expressions and formats.

A sequence of events for creating a tunnel in each of the three examples will now be described. For a tunnel between a managed switching element and a pool node the pool node is first provisioned and then the managed switching element is provisioned. A VM gets connected to a port of the managed switching element. This VM is the first VM that is connected to the managed switching element. This VM is then bound to a logical port of a logical switch by mapping the logical port to the port of the managed switching element. Once the mapping of the logical port to the port of the managed switching element is done a logical controller sends e.g. via physical controller s universal tunnel flow instructions to the chassis controller or to the physical controller that interfaces the managed switching element.

The chassis controller then instructs the managed switching element to create a tunnel to the pool node. Once the tunnel is created another VM that is subsequently provisioned and connected to the managed switching element will share the same tunnel to exchange data with the pool node if this new VM is bound to a logical port of the same logical switch. If the new node is bound to a logical port of a different logical switch the logical controller will send the same universal tunnel flow instructions that were passed down when the first VM was connected to the managed switching element. However the universal tunnel flow instructions will not cause to create a new tunnel to the pool node because for example a tunnel has already been created and operational.

If the established tunnel is a unidirectional tunnel another unidirectional tunnel is established from the pool node side. When the logical port to which the first VM is bounded is mapped to the port of the managed switching element the logical controller also sends universal tunnel flow instructions to the pool node. Based on the universal tunnel flow instructions a chassis controller that interfaces the pool node will instruct the pool node to create a tunnel to the managed switching element.

For a tunnel between a managed edge switching element and a managed switching element providing L3 gateway service it is assumed that a logical switch with several VMs of a user have been provisioned and a logical router is implemented in a transport node that provides the L3 gateway service. A logical patch port is created in the logical switch to link the logical router to the logical switch. In some embodiments an order in which the creation of the logical patch and provisioning of VMs do not make a difference to tunnel creation. The creation of the logical patch port causes a logical controller to send universal tunnel flow instructions to the chassis controllers interfacing all the managed switching elements that implement the logical switch i.e. all the managed switching elements that each has at least one port to which a logical port of the logical switch is mapped . Each chassis controller for each of these managed switching elements instructs the managed switching element to create a tunnel to the transport node. Each of the managed switching elements creates a tunnel to the transport node resulting in as many tunnels as the number of the managed switching elements that implement the logical switch.

If these tunnels are unidirectional the transport node is to create a tunnel to each of the managed switching elements that implement the logical switch. The logical switch pushes universal tunnel flow instructions to the transport node when the logical patch port is created and connected to the logical router. A chassis controller interfacing the transport node instructs the transport node to create tunnels and the transport node creates tunnels to the managed switching elements.

In some embodiments a tunnel established between two managed switching elements can be used for data exchange between any machine attached to one of the managed switching element and any machine attached to the other managed switching element regardless of whether these two machines are using logical ports of the same logical switch or of two different switches. That is one example case where tunneling enables different users that are managing different LDP sets to share the managed switching elements while being isolated.

A creation of a tunnel between two managed switching elements in which a logical port and another logical port that is attached to L2 gateway service starts when a logical port gets attached to L2 gateway service. The attachment causes the logical controller to send out universal tunnel flow instructions to all the managed switching elements that implement other logical ports of the logical switch. Based on the instructions tunnels are established from these managed switching elements to a managed switching element that implements the logical port attached to L2 gateway service.

As shown the logical switch includes logical ports 1 and 2. These logical ports of some embodiments can be both ingress ports and egress ports. The logical switch also includes forwarding tables . The logical switch receives network data e.g. packets through the ingress ports and routes the network data based on the logical flow entries specified in the forwarding tables to the egress ports through which the logical switch sends out the network data.

This figure also illustrates a UI . The UI is provided by a user interface application that allows the user to enter input values. The UI may be a web application a command line interface CLI or any other form of user interface through which the user can provide inputs. This user application of some embodiments sends the inputs in the form of API calls to an input translation application. As mentioned above an input translation application of some embodiments supports the API and sends the user input data to one or more logical controllers. The UI of some embodiments displays the current configuration of the logical switch that the user is managing.

VM is a virtual machine that sends data to the logical switch through port 1. That is port 1 of the logical switch is serving as an ingress port for VM . The logical switch performs logical ingress lookups using an ingress ACL table not shown which is one of forwarding tables in order to control the data e.g. packets coming through the ingress ports. For instance the logical switch reads information stored in the header of a packet that is received through an ingress port looks up the matching flow entry or entries in the ingress ACL table and determines an action to perform on the received packet. As described above a logical switch may perform further logical lookups using other forwarding tables that are storing flow entries. Also mentioned above the operation of a logical switch is performed by a set of managed switching elements that implement the logical switch by performing a logical processing pipeline.

When a logical port is enabled for QoS the logical port needs a logical queue to en queue the packets that are going into the logical switch through the logical port. In some embodiments the user assigns a logical queue to a logical port. A logical queue may be created based on the inputs in some embodiments. The user may also specify the minimum and maximum bitrates for the queue. When enabling a logical port for QoS the user may then point the logical port to the logical queue. In some embodiments multiple logical ports can share the same logical queue. By sharing the same logical queue the machines that send data to the logical switch through these logical ports can share the minimum and maximum bitrates associated with the logical queue.

In some embodiments the control application of a logical controller creates a logical queue collection for the logical port. The control application then has the logical queue collection point to the logical queue. The logical port and the logical queue collection have a one to one relationship in some embodiments. However in some embodiments several logical ports and corresponding logical queue collections can share one logical queue. That is the traffic coming through these several logical ports together are guaranteed for some level of performance specified for the logical queue.

Once a logical port points to a logical queue once the relationship between logical port the logical queue collection and the logical queue is established a physical queue collection and physical queue are created. The steps that lead to the creation of a physical queue collection and a physical queue will be described in detail further below by reference to .

In some embodiments the logical queue collection and the logical queue are mapped to a physical queue collection and a physical queue respectively. When the packets are coming into the logical switch through a logical port that points to a logical queue the packets are actually queued in the physical queue to which the logical queue is mapped. That is a logical queue is a logical concept that does not actually queue packets. Instead a logical queue indicates that the logical port that is associated with the logical queue is enabled for QoS.

In the first stage neither of the logical ports 1 and 2 of the logical switch is enabled for QoS. The logical switch routes packets that are coming from VM and VM through ports 1 and 2 to the egress ports without guaranteeing certain performance level because logical ports 1 and 2 are not enabled for QoS. On the physical side packets from VM are sent through port 3 of the managed switching element .

In the second stage a user using the UI enables port 1 of the logical switch for QoS by specifying information in the box next to port 1 in the UI in this example. The user specifies LQ as the ID of the logical queue to which to point port 1. The user also specifies A and B as the minimum and maximum bitrates respectively of the logical queue. A and B here represent bitrates which are numerical values that quantify the amount of data that the port allows to go through per unit of time e.g. 1 024 bit second etc. .

The control application creates a logical queue according to the specified information. The control application also creates a logical queue collection that would be set between port 1 and the logical queue LQ. The logical queue LQ queues the packets coming into the logical switch through port 1 in order to guarantee that the packets are routed at a bitrate between the minimum and the maximum bitrates. For instance the logical queue LQ will hold some of the packets in the queue when the packets are coming into the logical queue LQ through port 1 at a higher bitrate than the maximum bitrate. The logical switch will send the packets to the egress ports at a bitrate that is lower than the maximum bitrate but at a higher bitrate than the minimum bitrate . Conversely when the packets coming through port 1 are routed at a bitrate above but close to the minimum bitrate the logical queue LQ may prioritize the packets in the queue such that the logical switch routes these packets first over other packets in some embodiments.

On the physical side the managed switching element creates a physical queue collection and a physical queue in the host and associates the physical queue collection and the physical queue with PIF . A physical queue collection of some embodiments may include more than one physical queue in some embodiments. The physical queue collection in this example includes physical queue . The logical queue is mapped to the physical queue actual queuing takes place. That is the packets coming through port 1 of the logical switch in this example are queued in the physical queue . The physical queue in some embodiments is implemented as a storage structure for storing packets. The packets from VM are queued in the physical queue before the packets are sent out through PIF so that the packets that come in through port 3 are sent out at a bitrate between the minimum and maximum bitrates.

The input translation application the control application and the virtualization application are similar to the input translation application the control application the virtualization application and the virtualization application described above respectively. In this example the input translation application runs in an input translation controller and the control application and the virtualization application run in a logical controller.

The first stage shows that the control application includes input tables rules engine and an output tables which are similar to their corresponding components of the control application in . Not all components of the control application are shown for the control application for simplicity of illustration. This stage also shows a UI which is similar to the UI in .

In the first stage the UI displays QoS information of ports 1 and 2 of the logical switch . As indicated by the UI the logical ports of the logical switch are not enabled for QoS. The UI displays whether ports 1 and 2 of the logical switch which is identified by an identifier LSW are enabled for QoS. The unchecked boxes in the UI indicate that ports 1 and 2 of the logical switch are not enabled for QoS. In some embodiments the UI allows the user to specify a logical queue to which to point a logical port.

In the second stage the user provides input to indicate that user wishes to enable port 1 of the logical switch for QoS. As shown the user has checked a box next to port 1 in the UI and entered LQ as the logical queue ID to which to point port 1. The user has also entered a command to create the logical queue with A and B as the minimum and maximum bitrates respectively. The input translation application receives the user s inputs in the form of API calls. The input translation application translates the user s inputs into data that can be used by the control application and sends the translated inputs to the control application because the logical controller on which the control application runs is the master of the LDPS.

In the third stage the control application receives the inputs from the input translation application . Based on the received inputs the control application modifies three input tables . The input table shows whether a logical port of the logical switch has a logical queue collection for the logical port. In this example the control application first creates a logical queue collection identifier LQC for the logical queue that the user wants to create. The control application updates the entry in the input table for the logical port 1 to indicate that the logical queue collection identifier is created and associated with the logical port 1.

Upon creation of the logical queue collection identifier for the logical queue i.e. for the logical port 1 the rules engine performs table mapping operations to modify the input table . The input table shows whether a logical queue collection identifier is associated with a logical queue identifier. The control application creates a logical queue identifier LQ as the user has specified. The control application updates the input table to indicate the logical queue collection identifier LQC is related to the logical queue identifier LQ.

The control application also updates the input table which has a list of logical queue identifiers of the logical switch and each logical queue s minimum and the maximum bitrates. The control application creates an entry in the input table for the logical queue LQ having the minimum bitrate A and the maximum bitrate B that the user has specified. Based on the updates to the input tables the rules engine performs table mapping operations.

The fourth stage shows the result of the table mapping operations performed by the rules engine . As shown the rules engine has modified and or created an output table . The table is a table that specifies logical actions to be performed on a packet coming into the logical switch through the logical port 1 by the logical switch . The entry of the output table indicates that logical switch should accept the packet and set a logical queue for the logical port 1 i.e. associate a logical queue with the logical port 1 if the packet has correct logical context and has a source mac address that matches to the logical port 1 s default MAC address. The entry of the output table indicates that the logical switch should drop the packet if it does not match the conditions specified in the entry .

The fifth stage shows that the control application has sent the output table to the input tables of the virtualization application directly or via the NIB not shown of the control application. Based on a function table not shown the rules engine performs table mapping operations to unpack the table . In some embodiments unpacking a table means specifying a physical action i.e. an action that a managed switching element which has a port to which the logical port is mapped is to perform for each logical action specified in the table. The table shows the unpacked logical actions of the table . The entry specifies that the matching physical action for setting a logical queue is setting a physical queue with the minimum and maximum bitrates A and B. The entry specifies that setting context to the next context i.e. moving to the next operation of the logical processing pipeline is the matching physical action of the logical accept action. The entry specifies that the managed switching element should drop the packet when the logical switch s action is dropping the packet.

Once unpacking is done the rules engine performs table mapping actions to pack the unpacked table. In some embodiments packing an unpacked table means gathering all physical actions that match the logical actions in an entry of a table that was originally unpacked. The sixth stage shows that the table that results from packing has an expressions column that is identical to the expressions column of the table that was originally unpacked. Each entry of the table includes a set of physical actions that matches the set of logical actions specified for the corresponding entry in the table . Thus the table specifies all physical actions to be performed on a packet coming into the managed switching element through the port to which the logical port 1 is mapped. The rules engine performs table mapping operations to generate universal flow tables.

The seventh stage shows a table which is the result of performing the table mapping operations at the previous stage . As shown the table has three columns for LDPS identifiers flow types and abstract switch identifiers in addition to the table . A LDPS identifier identifies a LDPS. A flow type specifies the type of UPCP data. As mentioned above one of the types of UPCP data is universal tunnel flow instructions. An abstract switch identifier identifies a channel between two controller instances. The abstract switch identifiers are used to send the data only to those controller instances that are to get the data.

The eighth stage shows a physical controller which is another control instance and a master of the managed switching element in this example. The virtualization application along with the control application is running in a logical controller as mentioned above. The table is fed into the rules engine as an input table. The rules engine performs table mapping operations to determine whether the entries of the table are implemented by one of the managed switching elements of which the physical controller is a master. In this example the rules engine does not filter out the table and thus puts into the output tables as shown in the ninth stage .

At this stage the physical controller sends the output table to all chassis controllers which interfaces the managed switching elements of which the physical controller is a master to get data from the physical controller.

The next stage shows a chassis controller which interfaces with the managed switching element of which the physical controller is a master. In this example the chassis controller manages the managed switching element . As shown the table is fed into the rules engine of the chassis controller . The rules engine performs table mapping operations to parse the entries in the universal flow table .

The eleventh stage shows a table which includes entries for specifying a set of actions to be performed by the managed switching element that has a port to which the logical port 1 is mapped. Specifically physical actions actions before and actions after represent the operations in a logical processing pipeline that the managed switching element is to perform. Also some of these actions are expressed in terms of identifiers that are not specific to the managed switching element that the chassis controller is managing. In other words the entries in the table have not been customized by the chassis controller. The rules engine performs table mapping operations to generate physical queue collection identifier and physical queue identifier. The output table shows a physical queue identifier PQ. The output table shows that the physical queue identifier is mapped to the logical queue identifier.

The next stage shows that the tables and are fed back to the rules engine . The rules engine performs more table mapping operations to generate several requests to pass down to the managed switching element that the chassis controller is managing. The generated requests are shown in the next stage . These requests are in separate tables and . The table includes a request to create a queue collection for the PIF of the host not shown . The table includes a request to create a queue with the minimum and maximum bitrates of A and B and identifier PQ. The chassis controller sends the requests to the managed switching element . In some embodiments these requests are sent over a configuration channel established between the NOS not shown of the chassis controller and the managed switching element .

The fourteenth stage also shows a table which is the result of the table mapping operations performed at the previous stage . The table includes flow entries that are expressed in terms of the information that is specific to the managed switching element that the chassis controller is managing. The chassis controller sends these flow entries to the managed switching element over a switch control channel e.g. OpenFlow channel . The managed switching element would then forward the packets coming to the managed switching element based on the flow entries received from the chassis controller .

In this manner the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or a network of networks such as the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system may be used in conjunction with the invention.

While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi core processors that execute software some embodiments are performed by one or more integrated circuits such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . In some embodiments such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.

As used in this specification the terms computer server processor and memory all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device.

While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. In addition a number of the figures including and conceptually illustrate processes. The specific operations of these processes may not be performed in the exact order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. Furthermore the process could be implemented using several sub processes or as part of a larger macro process.

Also several embodiments were described above in which a user provides LDP sets in terms of LCP data. In other embodiments however a user may provide LDP sets in terms of LFP data. In addition several embodiments were described above in which a controller instance provides physical control plane data to a switching element in order to manage the switching element. In other embodiments however the controller instance may provide the switching element with physical forwarding plane data. In such embodiments the NIB would store physical forwarding plane data and the virtualization application would generate such data.

Furthermore in several examples above a user specifies one or more logical switches. In some embodiments the user can provide physical switching element configurations along with such logic switching element configurations. Also even though controller instances are described that in some embodiments are individually formed by several application layers that execute on one computing device one of ordinary skill will realize that such instances are formed by dedicated computing devices or other machines in some embodiments that perform one or more layers of their operations.

Also several examples described above show that a LDPS is associated with one user. One of the ordinary skill in the art will recognize that then a user may be associated with one or more sets of LDP sets in some embodiments. That is the relationship between a LDPS and a user is not always a one to one relationship as a user may be associated with multiple LDP sets. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details.
