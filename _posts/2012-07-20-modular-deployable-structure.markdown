The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1 a of Executive Order 10096 as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force to the entire right title and interest therein including foreign rights.

The present invention relates to a modular deployable structure in particular deployable panels such as photovoltaic panels for use on spacecraft.

Deployable space structures such as deployable truss structures using pin clevis joints are known for example from U.S. Pat. No. 4 932 802 to Rhodes. However the need exists for a modular deployable structure that allows synchronous deployment and rapid assembly of panels especially photovoltaic panels.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a modular deployable structure that provides synchronous deployment and rapid assembly of panels.

This object is realized by a modular deployable structure that comprises at least two panels one of which is configured to be pivotably attached to a further structure for deployment therefrom and return thereto respective interfaces for pivotably interconnecting each two panels wherein each interface is in the form of a pin clevis joint arrangement a respective dog bone link pivotably attached to each of the interfaces to effect pivoting of the panels respective linkage members extending adjacent to the panels and pivotable relative to the dogbone links wherein the linkage members pivotably interengage one another and wherein that linkage member adjacent that one panel that is pivotably connectable to the further structure is also configured to be pivotably attached to such structure and drive means for operatively effecting pivoting of one of the linkage members to in turn effect synchronized pivoting of all of the linkage members and the panels.

Thus applicants modular deployable structure which can readily utilize existing modular rigid photovoltaic panels is formed of a plurality of parallelogram linkages that effect a synchronous deployment of the panels via the interfaces that pivotably interconnect the panels the dogbone links that are pivotably attached to the interfaces and the linkage members that are connected to the dogbone links.

Applicants modular deployable structure while eliminating problematic free play of the joints can furthermore provide a high deployed rigidity by pre loading its structure onto stop elements.

While the various features of this invention are hereinafter illustrated and described as providing a modular deployable structure for a particular application for example for satellites and other spacecraft it is to be understood that the various features of this invention can be utilized singly or in various combinations thereof to provide a modular structure for other systems that utilize deployable panels or the like.

Therefore this invention is not to be limited to only the embodiments illustrated in the drawings because the drawings are merely utilized to illustrate one of the wide variety of usages of this invention.

Referring now to the drawings in detail applicants modular deployable structure or array which is designated generally by the reference numeral is shown in various stages of being folded together and deployed in whereas show details of the structure and operation of the various pivotable connections for the panels of the deployable structure.

To explain how the panels are interconnected and also are connected to the structure as well as how the modular deployable structure operates for synchronized deployment and folding together of the panels and reference will now be made to which show the interfaces that pivotably interconnect each two panels and which are designated generally by the reference numeral . Also shown are the dogbone links that via the interaction of linkage members effect pivoting of the panels the dogbone links are designated generally by the reference numeral .

As can be seen in particular in the dogbone link not only pivotably interconnects each two linkage members but is also pivotably connected to the interfaces that interconnect each two panels in such a way that pivoting of the linkage members simultaneously effects pivoting of the panels. At each dogbone link the two linkage members interengage one another. In the illustrated embodiments this interengagement is effected by a pair of gears one fixedly secured to each linkage member . In the embodiment of the gears are in the form of spur gears whereas in the embodiment of the gears are in the form of helical gears . One gear of the modular deployable structure is caused to rotate by a drive means as will be discussed in greater detail subsequently. One exemplary embodiment for the pivotable interconnection of two linkage members by a dogbone link can be best seen in . Here each of the two tangs of the dogbone link is pivotably held between two hackles of each linkage member .

As can further be seen in at that end of the dogbone link that is opposite the tangs thereof which are pivotably connected to the linkage members a further set of tangs is provided each of which is pivotably connected to one of the interfaces such that displacement of the dogbone link carries along and hence pivots the panels associated with the interfaces . With its two sets of tangs and the dogbone link has an approximately H shaped profile. A similar construction is provided for the half panel at its end remote from its pivotable connection to a panel . Here the structure takes the place of a further linkage member.

As mentioned previously each of the interfaces is in the form of a pin clevis joint this configuration can be best seen in which show how the tangs of the dogbone link are pivotably connected to the panels by the interfaces or pin clevis joints . In the illustrated embodiment each of the pin clevis joints includes a shackle portion that is appropriately secured to a panel . One leg of the shackle portion holds the head of a tapered pin the tapered shaft portion of which extends through a tapered bushing that is held in a bore of the tang . The end of the tapered pin that is opposite the head thereof can be secured in the shackle portion in any suitable manner for example by a nut. The pin clevis joint is pre loaded by a single or stack of Belleville washers or by any other appropriate spring element to provide a joint that has zero play. This spring arrangement also provides compensation for thermal expansion and wear.

The exemplary embodiment illustrated in shows an alternative hinge stop design. Here full deployment is ensured by tension spring elements that pre load the modular deployable structure in the deployed position. With this embodiment the deployment stop posts do not extend to the center line of the dogbone link but rather engage recesses provided in the dogbone link see for example . As shown in microbeanngs that are connected to stop posts ride along the recesses until stop posts respectively engage two recesses in deployment stop that is attached to the dogbone link for example via screws . Again deployment synchronization is ensured via the spur gears or helical gears . The gears are attached to the shackles of the linkage members for example via screws and connect the dogbone link to the panels via the tapered pin clevis construction discussed above.

As mentioned previously rotation of the gears or for deployment or folding together of the modular deployable structure is effected by the drive means which in the embodiment illustrated in is in the form of a stepper or infinitely variable motor that is mounted to the structure . When the motor is activated its drive shaft to which is attached the spur gear or similar engagement means is caused to rotate which in turn rotates the spur gear which is rotatably mounted on the structure . Rotation of the spur gear causes the spur gear to rotate which since it is fixedly attached to a linkage member consequently causes such linkage member to rotate and to rotate together with it via the intervention of the dogbone link and the pin clevis joint the associated panel in the manner described in detail above. In the illustrated embodiment the driven panel is the half panel see . Deployment or folding in of the panel synchronously deploys or folds in the remaining panels . Instead of the motor it would be possible to use for example a torsional spring.

The electrical harnessing of the modular deployable structure between the here solar panels themselves and the structure or spacecraft bus to form a service loop is indicated schematically only by the reference numeral in .

If the modular deployable structure is in the form of solar array structure panels would be photovoltaic panels.

If it is desired to reverse the orientation of the modular deployable structure for example where the panels are solar panels in order to have the appropriate side of the panels facing in the correct orientation it is merely necessary to remove the deployment stops and the spring elements and reattach them in an upside down position at the alternate attachment points so that the deployed orientation can be approached from the opposite rotational direction. illustrate stop positioned with the recesses facing downwards to arrest the rotation of stop post when panels are rotated downward and have reached their deployed flat configuration. Springs have been omitted from . show stop rotated 180 from its position in by being attached at points so that the recesses are facing upwards to stop the rotation of stop post when panels are rotated upwards and have reached their deployed configuration. Springs have been omitted from both of the foregoing figures. Especially when a half panel is utilized it is particularly easy to reverse the deployment or stowing direction of the modular deployable structure without requiring disconnection of the entire modular deployable structure from the structure or spacecraft bus . In particular the deployment stop spring assemblies or the deployment stops are removed at every hinge location they are later reinstalled to the dogbone links in the opposite direction after the modular deployable structure in particular the remaining attached half panel has been stowed in the opposite direction.

Although in the illustrated embodiments two linkage members are shown adjacent each of the panels and hence two associated sets of pin clevis joints and dogbone links are shown for each panel one linkage member either centrally or toward one side would be sufficient. However two or more linkage members are preferred for stability.

Finally as can be seen in particular in the dogbone link tangs are offset relative to the dogbone link tangs this ensures that the modular deployable structure can be stowed compactly against the structure or spacecraft bus as shown in .

The present invention is of course in no way restricted to the specific disclosure of the specification and drawings but also encompasses any modifications within the scope of the appended claims.
