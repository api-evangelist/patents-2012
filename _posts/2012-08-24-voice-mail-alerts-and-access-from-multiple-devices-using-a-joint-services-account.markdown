title: Voice mail alerts and access from multiple devices using a joint services account
abstract: A first network device is configured to receive a message that identifies a relationship between a wireless user device and a client device. The relationship allows voice mail information, associated with voice mail messages for the wireless user device, to be sent to the client device. The first network device is configured to receive voice mail information associated with a voice mail message for the wireless user device, determine to send the voice mail information to the client device, based on the information identifying the relationship between the wireless user device and the client device; and send the voice mail information to the client device.

When a phone call is made from a first user device to a second user device the user of the second user device may not accept the phone call from the first user device. The user of the first user device may leave a voice mail message for a user of the second user device if the user of the second user device does not accept the phone call.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Systems and or methods described herein may set up and activate a joint account that allows for sending voice mail notifications and or messages relating to incoming calls to from a wireless user device to one or more types of devices such as a set top box. For example a user may set up a joint account that permits notifications of voice mail messages for a wireless user device associated with one account to another device e.g. a set top box associated with another account. Once the joint account is created a user may receive notifications of voice mail messages via the wireless user device and via the other device whenever the voice mail is stored for the wireless user device.

A notification of a voice mail message may be a message that notifies a user that the user has received a voice mail message. A voice mail message may be an audio message that is recorded and stored in a network device that can be retrieved by the user. Voice mail information may be defined as a voice mail message a notification of a voice mail message or both a voice mail message and a notification of a voice mail message.

Mary enters her login information e.g. user ID and password for her account with FXT Digital TV. Once the FXT Digital TV account login information is validated the web page may request Mary to select the type of content that Mary would like to have sent to her digital cable television account. Mary decides to select voice mail.

As shown in the web page may display information to Mary about the available user devices that can receive the voice mail information. For example the web page may display all of the set top boxes that are used in Mary s cable television service from FXT Digital TV. Also the web page may display all of the wireless devices that Mary has with XYZ Wireless. Mary has the option to send content such as voice mail information intended for her smart phone to one or more of the set top boxes. Mary also has the option of choosing to send content intended for Simon s smart phone to one or more of the set top boxes. As shown in Mary decides to select to send voice mail information intended for Mary s smart phone labeled as Mary on the web page to the set top box in the living room.

Mary may also have other options for sending content. Mary may be able to send voice mail information according to the time of day. For example Mary may decide that she would like to have incoming voice mail information intended for her smart phone to be sent to the living room set top box only during certain times of the day. Mary may also have the option to suspend sending voice mail information. For example Mary may decide to go on vacation and may be able to temporarily suspend sending voice mail information to the living room set top box.

With all the information provided for the joint account the web page may provide Mary with a joint account identifier and password. In the future Mary may use the joint account identifier and password to log into the joint account to perform actions related to sending content to user devices serviced by XYZ Wireless and FXT Digital TV.

As shown in Jane using her smart phone Jane s smart phone makes a call to Mary s smart phone. Mary s smart phone may be on or off Assume that Mary s smart phone is on. At the time Jane calls Mary Mary is exercising in front of the living room television and Mary has left her smart phone in the bedroom. Mary does not accept Jane s phone call and Jane is prompted to leave a voice mail for Mary. Jane leaves a voice mail message for Mary. A notification of the voice mail message is sent to Mary s smart phone. Another notification regarding Jane s voice mail message is communicated to a set top box in the living room that provides content to a living room television. The living room set top box sends a notification of Jane s voice mail message to the living room television. The living room television receives the notification of Jane s voice mail message that may be displayed on the living room television You have voice mail from Jane 505 555 1212 . Mary may view the notification message and decide whether to listen to the voice mail message. Mary decides to listen to the voice mail message through the living room television. In this case Mary s set top box may send a request for the voice mail message to a voice mail server which may provide the voice mail message to the set top box. The set top box may then play the voice mail message on the living room television.

As a result a user may be able to send voice mail messages intended for one user device e.g. a smart phone to one or more other user devices. This may provide the user with a level of flexibility in their ability to be notified of and or to listen to the voice mail messages on different user devices associated with different service providers.
