This application is the U.S. National Phase of PCT KR2012 010390 filed Dec. 3 2012 which claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2011 0146217 filed Dec. 29 2011.

The present invention relates to a conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a liquid crystal display LCD and a method of forming a ground electrode using the same.

The ground electrode of a LCD plays a role of blocking the static electricity inflow from outside and ITO Indium Tin Oxide or IZO Indium Zinc Oxide has been used as a ground electrode material formerly.

The ITO or IZO has an advantage of excellent electric resistance and surface hardness but they have a disadvantage that a particular process such as a vacuum deposit process and the like is required for forming a ground electrode by using the same and the light transparency of the formed electrode is poor.

And recently as the problem of the exhaustion of indium resources has been on the rise the development of various transparent electrode materials for replacing ITO and the like is being issued.

However many transparent electrode materials hitherto known for example conductive polymers or inorganic conductive compositions including a metal or a metal oxide and the like have shown unsatisfactory results.

Particularly in case of a conductive polymer the light transparency is relatively good but there is a problem that the surface resistance increases according to the use time for the ground electrode.

It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a liquid crystal display LCD which is superior in the coating uniformity and can provide a ground electrode having low surface resistance and high light transparency and surface hardness.

It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a method of forming a ground electrode for a LCD using said composition.

According to the present invention a conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a LCD including a conductive polymer a dopant a solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule and a silane coupling agent is provided.

Here the conductive composition may include 0.1 to 10 weight of the conductive polymer 0.1 to 10 weight of the dopant 60 to 95 weight of the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule and 0.1 to 20 weight of the silane coupling agent.

Furthermore the composition may further include one or more solvents selected from the group consisting of methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol isopropanol ethylene glycol butanediol neopentyl glycol 1 3 pentanediol 1 4 cyclohexane dimethanol diethylene glycol polyethylene glycol polybutylene glycol dimethylol propane trimethylol propane propylene glycol monomethyl ether chloroform dichloromethane tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene dibromoethane dibromopropane n methylpyrrolidone dimethyl sulfoxide triethylamine tributylamine trioctylamine cresol and water as a co solvent.

At this time the co solvent may be included with a weight ratio of 1 10 to 1 20 on the basis of the weight of the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule.

The conductive polymer may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of polyaniline based polymer polypyrrole based polymer and polythiophene based polymer.

The dopant may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid toluenesulfonic acid camphorsulfonic acid benzenesulfonic acid hydrochloric acid styrenesulfonic acid 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid 2 sulfosuccinate 5 sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid dimethyl 5 sodiumsulfoisophthalate and 5 sodiumsulfo bis hydroxyethylisophthalate .

Furthermore the silane coupling agent may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of alkyloxysilane based compound aminosilane based compound vinylsilane based compound epoxysilane based compound methacryloxysilane based compound isocyanatesilane based compound and fluorinesilane based compound.

In addition to according to the present invention a method of forming a ground electrode for a LCD including a step of coating the conductive composition on a substrate is provided.

The conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a LCD according to the present invention is superior in the coating uniformity and the ground electrode formed by using the same has low surface resistance and high light transparency and surface hardness and is particularly superior in 500 hours reliability and thus it makes it possible to provide a ground electrode for a LCD particularly an in plane switching IPS mode LCD a fringe field switching FFS mode LCD and the like having more improved properties.

Hereinafter the conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a LCD and the method of forming a ground electrode using the same are explained according to the concrete embodiments of the present invention.

First of all in the whole of the present specification the term include or comprise means including any component or constituent or step without any limitation unless there is overt mention about them and it should not be understood as excluding or eliminating an addition of other components.

In the process of studying a LCD the present inventors recognized that when the conductive composition for forming a ground electrode includes a solvent satisfying a certain property in company with a conductive polymer a dopant and a silane coupling agent the diffusion of the conductive polymer and the dopant in the composition can be facilitated according to the heat of reaction generated during the preparation of the composition and the acidity range of the composition. And from this the present inventors recognized that since not only the coating uniformity of the composition is superior but also the ground electrode formed by using the same has low surface resistance high light transparency and surface hardness it is possible to provide a ground electrode for a LCD having superior properties and accomplished the present invention.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a conductive composition for forming a ground electrode of a LCD including a conductive polymer a dopant a solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule and a silane coupling agent is provided.

Namely the conductive composition according to the present invention is a composition that the conductive composition the dopant and the silane coupling agent are dispersed in a dispersion medium including the solvent and since the composition includes the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule the dispersity of the conductive polymer and the dopant in the composition can be optimized and the coating uniformity of the composition is good and the ground electrode formed by using the same can maintain low surface resistance even under the condition of high temperature and high humidity and can show high light transparency and surface hardness.

Hereinafter the components which may be included in the conductive composition according to the embodiment are explained.

At first the conductive polymer is a basic component for giving conductivity to the composition and any conductive polymer common in the technical field to which the present invention pertains may be used and it is not limited particularly.

However according to the present invention the conductive polymer may be one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of polyaniline based polymer polypyrrole based polymer and polythiophene based polymer. Particularly it may be preferable in the aspect of securing conductivity and dispersity that the conductive polymer is poly 3 4 ethylene dioxythiophene which is one of the polythiophene based polymer.

And the content of the conductive polymer may be 0.1 to 10 weight preferably 0.5 to 10 weight and more preferably 1 to 5 weight per the total weight of the composition. Namely the content of the conductive polymer is preferably 0.1 weight or more per the total weight of the composition in order to prevent the increase of the electric resistance while securing a minimum conductivity required to the composition. However if the conductive polymer is excessively included in the composition the light transparency the dispersity and the stability of the composition may deteriorate and thus the content of the conductive polymer is preferably 10 weight or less in order to prevent such deterioration.

Meanwhile the conductive composition according to the embodiment may include a dopant. The dopant is a component for giving conductivity to the composition in company with said conductive polymer and it is not limited particularly because any dopant common in the related art may be included in the composition.

However according to the present invention the dopant may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid toluenesulfonic acid camphorsulfonic acid benzenesulfonic acid hydrochloric acid styrenesulfonic acid 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid 2 sulfosuccinate 5 sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid dimethyl 5 sodiumsulfoisophthalate and 5 sodiumsulfo bis hydroxyethylisophthalate . Most of all it is preferable for securing the conductivity and the dispersity that the dopant is poly 4 styrenesulfonate .

Particularly it is more preferable in the aspect of the effects disclosed above to use a PEDOT PPS by mixing poly 4 styrenesulfonate hereinafter TSS as the dopant to poly 3 4 ethylene dioxythiophene hereinafter PEDOT among the conductive polymers.

Namely the conductivity of PEDOT itself is lower than ITO but it has the conductivity of about 500 s cm and shows better electric characteristics than ITO by forming a suitable interface with an organic active layer. However the solubility of PEDOT is not enough and there is a problem of ambient stability and thus it is preferable to use a form of PEDOT PSS by adding PPS to PEDOT.

The PEDOT PSS may be obtained by adding PPS as an anionic dopant to PEDOT. PEDOT and PSS are coupled by electrostatic attraction see the following Chemical Formula 1 and PEDOT takes on positive charge by PPS and it makes a band gap small so as to have metallic electron band structure. Here the characteristics such as an electric conductivity a work function and the like may be changed according to the change of the PPS rate.

According to the present invention the content of the dopant may be 0.1 to 10 weight preferably 0.5 to 10 weight and more preferably 1 to 5 weight per the total weight of the composition. Namely in view of the electric resistance and dispersion property of the composition and the effect of adding said dopant it is advantageous that the content of the dopant is controlled within the range disclose above.

The solvent is a dispersion medium of the conductive composition according to the present invention and particularly a solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule is preferable. Namely according to the present invention when the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule is used as the dispersion medium of the composition it influences on the acidity of the composition and promotes the diffusion of the conductive polymer and the dopant and thus the dispersity can be optimized. According to this the coating uniformity of the composition can be improved and the surface electric conductivity of the ground electrode formed by using the same can be more improved because the surface resistance is low and it is possible to show superior light transparency and surface hardness and high reliability even under the condition of high temperature and high humidity.

According to the present invention it is preferable that the solvent is dimethylformamide acethylacetone or a mixture thereof among the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule.

Furthermore according to the present invention it is more preferable that the solvent is a mixture of dimethylformamide and acethylacetone. Namely when the mixture of dimethylformamide and acethylacetone is used as the solvent the diffusion of the conductive polymer and the dopant is promoted more and the dispersity can be better than the case of using dimethylformamide or acethylacetone solely and not only the hardness of the ground electrode formed from the composition but also the reliability of the ground electrode can be improved more.

Furthermore the composition according to the present invention may further include a co solvent in addition to the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule.

Here the co solvent may be one or more solvents selected from the group consisting of methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol isopropanol ethylene glycol butanediol neopentyl glycol 1 3 pentanediol 1 4 cyclohexane dimethanol diethylene glycol polyethylene glycol polybutylene glycol dimethylol propane trimethylol propane propylene glycol monomethyl ether chloroform dichloromethane tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene dibromoethane dibromopropane n methylpyrrolidone dimethyl sulfoxide triethylamine tributylamine trioctylamine cresol and water.

The co solvent may be included with a weight ratio of 1 10 to 1 20 and preferably 1 15 to 1 20 on the basis of the weight of the solvent having a carbonyl group in the molecule so as to exhibit the effect according to the addition of the solvent having a carbonyl group sufficiently.

More preferably the conductive composition according to the present invention may include a solvent in which 100 parts by weight of isopropyl alcohol 80 to 150 parts by weight of propylene glycol monomethyl ether 5 to 30 parts by weight of dimethylformamide acethylacetone or a mixture thereof and 50 to 120 parts by weight of water are mixed. Most preferably the conductive composition according to the present invention may include a solvent in which 100 parts by weight of isopropyl alcohol 90 to 110 parts by weight of propylene glycol monomethyl ether 15 to 20 parts by weight of dimethylformamide acethylacetone or a mixture thereof and 80 to 100 parts by weight of water are mixed.

And the content of the solvent may be 60 to 95 weight preferably 70 to 95 weight and more preferably 80 to 95 weight per the total weight of the composition. Namely the content of the solvent is preferably 60 weight or more per the total weight of the composition in order to secure the coating property suitable to the process of forming the ground electrode while securing a minimum stability required to the composition. However if the solvent is excessively included in the composition the concentration of the conductive polymer becomes relatively low and the electric resistance may increase and the shock resistance of the ground electrode formed by using the composition may deteriorate. Therefore the content of the solvent is preferably 95 weight or less per the total weight of the composition in order to prevent such deterioration.

Furthermore the conductive composition according to the embodiment may include a silane coupling agent.

The silane coupling agent is a component for improving the dispersity of the conductive polymer the dopant and so on and any silane coupling agent common in the technical field to which the present invention pertains may be used and it is not limited particularly.

However according to the present invention the silane coupling agent may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of an alkyloxysilane based compound an aminosilane based compound a vinylsilane based compound an epoxysilane based compound a methacryloxysilane based compound an isocyanatesilane based compound and a fluorinesilane based compound.

Preferably the silane coupling agent may be one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of tetraethyloxysilane vinyltriethoxysilane vinyltrimethoxysilane vinyltris methoxyethoxy silane methacryloxy propyltrimethoxysilane 3 4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane aminopropyltriethoxysilane N aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ureidepropyltriethoxysilane phenyltriethoxysilane methyltriethoxysilane methyltrimethoxysilane polyethyleneoxide modified silane polymethylethoxysiloxane and hexamethyldisilazine.

And the content of the silane coupling agent may be 0.1 to 20 weight preferably 1 to 15 weight and more preferably 3 to 10 weight per the total weight of the composition. Namely the content of the silane coupling agent is preferably 0.1 weight or more per the total weight of the composition in order to prevent the surface staining phenomenon and the decrease of the surface hardness due to the phase separation of the composition during the coating process. However if the silane coupling agent is excessively included in the composition the electric resistance may increase and the stability of the composition may be so much the worse. Therefore the content of the silane coupling agent is preferably 20 weight or less per the total weight of the composition in order to prevent such deterioration.

Furthermore the conductive composition according to the present invention may further include additives common in the related art with necessity.

According to the present invention said additive may be one or more selected from the group consisting of a binder resin a surfactant and a diluent solution of hydrochloric acid or acetic acid.

At this time the content of the additives may be determined within the range that does not have a bad influence on the properties of the composition while showing a minimum effect of adding the same and it may be 0.1 to 5 weight per the total weight of the composition preferably.

On the other hand according to another embodiment of the present invention a method of forming a ground electrode for a LCD including a step of coating the conductive composition disclosed above on a substrate is provided.

Here coating methods common in the related art may be unlimitedly applied to the method of coating the conductive composition on the substrate and preferably a spray method a doctor blade method a roll coating method a dipping method and the like may be used.

At this time the coating thickness of the composition may be 0.1 to 1 m. The ground electrode of a LCD may be prepared by soft baking the coated composition under the temperature of 60 to 100 C. so as to form a film layer of 200 to 500 nm thickness and drying the same under the temperature of about 100 to 150 C.

The conductive composition according to the present invention can be used for forming a ground electrode of a LCD as disclosed above and it may be applied to the use of a coating film of a conductive polarizing plate which can replace existing ground electrodes in addition.
