A wide variety of applications such as signal analysis signal processing spectroscopy and others are enabled by the use of an appropriate light absorbing material commonly known as a spatially and spectrally selective holographic SSH or S2 material or an inhomogeneously broadened transition IBT material. The material can be used in a variety of useful modes. In many applications the SSH material is used to record a target analog spectrum in the frequency domain for the signal or signals of interest SOIs to be processed. The spectrum of one or more signals is made to interact with the SSH material by having them be modulated onto an optical laser carrier such that the modulated optical spectrum is resonant with the atomic absorbers in the SSH material. A modulated optical spectrum can represent either inherent optical information or radio frequency microwave millimeter wave information that is purposely imposed by modulating onto an optical laser carrier with an electro optical modulator. The analog spectrum can be phase sensitive in certain applications and conditions. Combinations of phase sensitive analog spectra e.g. multiplications can result in correlative signal processing data storage or signal processing e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 265 712 and 7 307 781 and 7 471 224 the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by references as if fully set forth herein .

In another set of embodiments an apparatus includes a source for optical electromagnetic radiation and a cryocooler configured to maintain an operating temperature in a range from about 3 Kelvin to about 5 Kelvin.

The apparatus also includes a doped crystal comprising Thulium doped into a host crystal of Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet disposed inside the cryocooler in a position to be illuminated by incident optical electromagnetic radiation derived from the source. The apparatus also includes a detector configured to detect optical electromagnetic radiation emitted from the doped crystal.

In another set of embodiments a method comprises mounting a doped crystal in a cryocooler wherein the doped crystal comprises Thulium doped into a host crystal of Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet. The method further comprises maintaining inside the cryocooler an operating temperature in a range from about 3 Kelvin to about 5 Kelvin. The method also comprises causing the doped crystal to be illuminated by incident optical electromagnetic radiation derived from a source. The method still further includes detecting optical electromagnetic radiation emitted from the doped crystal.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Techniques are described for spatial spectral holography. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Some embodiments of the invention are described below in the context of a doped crystal with 3 atomic percent at. Thulium dopant in Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet YLuAG . However the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments doped crystals are used with substantially less than 3 at. Thulium dopant in YLuAG

A new spatially and spectrally selective holographic SSH material has been discovered for signal processing applications as characterized with useful and non obvious properties. The material is Thulium doped into a host of Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet Tm YLuAlO where x 1.5 or typically between 0.1 2.9. This is also referred to as Tm YLuAG or Tm YLuAG hereinafter. The addition of Lutetium in place of some Yttrium in the host gives broadening of the inhomogeneous absorption line. For example when x 1.5 the material exhibits a large full width at half maximum absorption bandwidth of 270 gigHertz GHz 1 GHz 10Hertz 1 Hertz Hz one cycle per second for a Thulium dopant level of 3.0 atomic percent 3.0 at. . Other material properties of interest are specified for dopant densities in the range of approximately 0.1 3.0 atomic percent at. of Tm specifically 1 having an optical absorption strength sufficient for signal processing applications while allowing for practical optical path lengths in physical samples approximately 0.1 15 centimeter in length 1 centimeter cm 10meters 2 being able to grow crystals with high spatial quality to minimize undesired optical scattering 3 having a center absorption wavelength of about 793.8 nm 4 exhibiting desirable coherent optical qualities at a temperature of operation of about 4 Kelvin K including 4a a lifetime of the upper state atomic transition of about 1 millisecond ms 1 ms 10seconds 4b a high branching ratio to a bottleneck state with a long lifetime of about 17 ms in the absence of any applied magnetic field 4c an inherent spectral resolution of less than 25 kiloHertz kHz 1 kHz 10Hz 4d being able to maintain a spectral resolution of less than 1 megaHertz MHz 1 MHz 10Hz under practical conditions of atomic population storage time and wideband excitation and 4e being able to exhibit these properties uniformly across the absorption band.

The SSH material has been characterized to date with a dopant level of Thulium for 3.0 at. into a host of YLuAG where x 1.5 or when the mixture of Y and Lu is 50 50 . Based on the new measurements made herein a range of Thulium dopant level equal to and lower than 3.0 at. is anticipated to be useful and lower concentrations than 3 at. are determined to be advantageous by exhibiting coherence parameters better than those measured. The advantageous specifications for the lower Tm dopant levels can be optimized by further experimentation. Varying the Y and Lu mixture is anticipated to tune the bandwidth to be narrower than YLuAG for both x greater than 1.5 and x less than 1.5 as compared to x 1.5 where the bandwidth will be significantly wider than Tm YAG for YLuAG under the conditions when approximately 0.1

Electromagnetic spectral processing system includes a controller one or more electromagnetic EM source electromagnetic couplers collectively referenced hereinafter as couplers electromagnetic modulators two atomic state material e.g. an SSH material such as IBT material in cooler electromagnetic detectors and post detection electronics such as electromagnetic signal analyzer .

In the illustrated embodiment EM source includes an input laser and a laser stabilization block . This laser provides stabilized optical carrier frequency beams in the TeraHertz range THz 1 THz 10cycles per second used to carry a target optical spectrum and a chirped laser field used as a probe waveform and a population reconfiguration waveform. In some embodiments a single laser provides the carrier frequency beam for both the target optical spectrum and probe signals. In some embodiments additional laser sources are included in EM source . In various embodiments electric signals from laser stabilization block controls frequency amplitude or phase or some combination for laser . Propagation of EM waveforms is indicated in by straight arrows. Electronic connections for signal processing and control are represented by segmented lines without arrowheads.

The EM couplers direct EM waveforms such as optical beam between the various components and include not only air and empty space but also such optical couplers as mirrors phase plates optical fibers among others well known in the art of optics and electromagnetic propagation. In the illustrated embodiment EM coupler splits carrier beam into two carrier beams at the same optical frequency.

The EM modulators modulate the carrier frequency beams to produce signal beams with rich frequency content. In the illustrated embodiment EM modulators include input signal source acousto optic modulators AOMs collectively referenced hereinafter as AOMs and arbitrary waveform generator AWG . In some embodiments one or more AOMs are replaced with or added to other optical modulators such as one or more electro optic phase modulators EOPMs electro optic amplitude modulators and electro absorption modulators. In some embodiments AWG is replaced by or added to other wave generators such as one or more pulse pattern generators.

The input signal source is any combination of components that generate a target electromagnetic spectrum to be placed on an optical carrier for use in system . For example input signal source is a radio frequency signal to be analyzed such as a radar pulse or its reflected return or both as described in published International Patent application WO 2003 098384 entitled Techniques for processing high time bandwidth signals using a material with inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum Inventors K. D. Merkel Z. Cole K. M. Rupavatharam W. R. Babbitt T. Chang and K. H. Wagner 27 Nov. 2003 hereinafter Merkel . The input signal source is an electronic signal such as a voltage. AOMs are used to modulate the optical carrier from input laser in proportion to the sign and magnitude of an applied radio frequency RF voltage. This produces an encoded optical field with a target optical spectrum. In other embodiments other modulators are used in place of or in addition to AOMs to produce optical field encoded in frequency or amplitude or both with the target optical spectrum. In other embodiments multiple modulated laser beams in one or more directions interact to form the optical target optical spectrum.

The AWG generates a arbitrary reference waveform such as chirped radio frequency waveform such as a linear radio frequency chirp of bandwidth B around a carrier radio frequency. The AOM imposes this same reference waveform on the laser carrier beam e.g. to produce one or more chirped laser fields starting at an optical frequency s . In other embodiments the laser can create the reference waveform such as an optical chirp and no external modulator scheme such as the combination of components and is needed or used. The single direction of the depicted optical field is called a collinear geometry which records only the spectral content of the signal. In some embodiments various angled beam geometries are used in which the signal consists of multiple beams impinging on the two state material e.g. an SSH material IBT such as material in different directions.

The EM two atomic state material e.g. an SSH materials such as IBT material records one or more EM fields that impinge on the material with sufficient intensity and duration. An appropriate light absorbing SSH material can be used as the IBT material in a variety of modes. The SSH materials that are used in many applications are intended to record an analog spectrum in the frequency domain for the target analog signal of interest SOI to be processed. The analog spectrum can be phase sensitive in certain applications and combinations of phase sensitive analog spectra e.g. multiplications can result in correlative signal processing. The desirable SSH material should exhibit a combination of desirable properties including high spatial quality wavelength of operation optical absorption strength temperature of operation lifetime of the atomic transition bandwidth of operation and resolution bandwidth of operation.

The materials known to date outside the current work are typically a rare earth element doped into a host material where the host material is typically a crystalline structure. The materials known presently outside the current work that do exhibit a proper combination of these properties for practical operation are in the public domain and are quite limited. Such known materials have the desirable properties only at very low temperatures. Consequently the SSH material is contained in a cooler such as a liquid Helium cooler or cryocooler. The cooler includes one or more optical windows so that optical waveforms may impinge the material and optical waveforms emitted from the material can be detected. As used herein an optical window includes an transparent portion of a wall of the cooler or optical fiber penetrating the wall of the cooler or some other known mechanism for transmitting the light across a wall of the cooler or some combination. Thus in some embodiments the cooler is a cryocooler that includes a first optical window configured to allow optical electromagnetic radiation to pass into the cryocooler. In some embodiments the system includes a low vibration stage to dampen vibrations from one or more other components of the system including vibrations from a compressor of the cooler .

When multiple beams interact in the material at different angles spatial spectral structures are formed in the material. When all beams impinge in the same direction only spectral content is recorded. For example in some embodiments the two atomic state material is an SSH material that stores a complex spatial spectral grating as absorption variations within a doped low temperature crystal. In some embodiments the one or more optical fields produce target optical spectra as spectral or spatial spectral gratings. In some embodiments one or more chirped laser fields are recorded as spectral or spatial spectral gratings in SSH material. At a later time another optical beam is directed with relatively lower intensity to the SSH material to produce one or more response fields collectively referenced hereinafter as response fields . The chirped laser field and the optical field may impinge on the material at the same location and angle or at different locations and angles in various embodiments.

In some embodiments for laser stabilization field is also passed by coupler into the SSH material and a feedback field is emitted by the SSH material. The feedback field is passed by EM coupler as field to laser stabilization block . Based on the properties of feedback field the laser stabilization block controls laser .

For heterodyne readout processes a reference optical field e.g. field is also produced in addition to a primary response field e.g. . Any method of generating a reference field may be used. In the illustrated embodiment the reference optical field emerges from the optical material usually in a spatial mode that has not recorded the target optical spectrum from optical field such as experienced by chirped laser field . In some embodiments the reference signal is a chirped laser field not shown that has not passed through the SSH material. In some embodiments the reference signal is the transmitted probe signal that is naturally in the same direction as the response signal that itself is often delayed. Thus in such embodiments the signal detected at the optical detectors is naturally heterodyne. In some embodiments the reference signal is a response signal from the chirped optical field interacting with one or more spatial spectral gratings recorded in the SSH material for the purpose of generating a reference field. In some embodiments in which the detector is outside the cooler the cooler includes an exit optical window among windows that allow the emitted optical signals to pass out of the cooler .

The EM detectors include one or more detectors such as optical detectors that detect the time varying optical intensity in a certain optical bandwidth. In some embodiments a one or two dimensional array of optical detectors is used to simultaneously detect a response field on multiple spatial modes. Scanned or instant images can be generated by the array of detectors. In some embodiments the EM detector detects only the response field . In some embodiments the EM detector detects the heterodyne combination of the response field and reference field . For example the heterodyne combination generates beat frequency variations that are much lower in frequency and larger in amplitude than response signal intensity variations therefore the beat frequency variations are more accurately measured with current detectors.

The post detection electronics in EM analyzer use electrical signals output by detectors . In the some embodiments EM analyzer includes a scope digitizer and processor. In various embodiments EM analyzer includes different hardware and software components.

The controller uses electronic signals to control EM modulators and EM source . In some embodiments the controller uses electronic signals from EM analyzer to determine how to control EM source and EM modulators . In various embodiments controller includes different hardware and software components that perform the methods described in the next section. In various embodiments the controller is a computer system as described in more detail below with reference to or a chip set described in more detail below with reference to

In various embodiments spectral content is imposed in the SSH material or read or both based on the interaction of one or more optical fields or or both. The spectral content is then erased or inverted or both based on one or more subsequent chirped electromagnetic fields designed for reconfiguration of atomic state populations in the SSH material.

Although processes equipment and data structures are depicted in as integral blocks in a particular arrangement for purposes of illustration in other embodiments one or more processes or data structures or portions thereof are arranged in a different manner on the same or different hosts in one or more databases or are omitted or one or more different processes or data structures are included on the same or different hosts.

Using a system such as system some SSH materials have been used as versatile optical coherent transient OCT processing devices. An OCT device relies on a broadband spatial spectral grating in the optical range that extends over several homogeneous lines and part or all of the available inhomogeneous broadening absorption profile. All the features of an optical spatial spectral grating are typically formed substantively simultaneously by recording the spatial spectral interference of two or more optical pulses separated in time only purely spectral grating or separated in both space and time a spatial spectral grating . A spatial spectral grating has the ability to generate a broadband optical output signal that depends on an optical input probe waveform impinging on that grating and the programming waveforms that formed the grating.

In optical analog signal processing the medium is used to store particular spectral features of interest such as the result of the interaction of one or more optical waveforms e.g. optical beams carrying information . See for example references listed in references section at the end of this description.

In some circumstances including those described by Merkel the medium is an optically absorptive medium when most of the population is in the ground state of the two electron quantum level states. This reduces the signal level of a readout beam transmitted through the medium. However when the population is evenly divided between the two states and all coherent superposition states have decayed away the medium is transparent e.g. signal levels transmitted are essentially equal to the signal levels impinging. Furthermore when most of the population is in the excited state the medium is amplifying e.g. signal levels transmitted are greater than the signal levels impinging.

In Merkel chirped readout is described. In this case it is typical to define a desired set of specifications to be achieved simultaneously. There are tradeoffs between the desired specifications. The four parameters specifications of interest are 1 the instantaneous bandwidth IBW 2 the time T it takes to get that information out where the update rate is 1 T assuming that in a time T any given frequency across the IBW is revisited and updated 3 the bandwidth of the photo detection PBW and 4 the resolution bandwidth RBW of the device across the IBW. The number of frequency channels N being measured by the device is N IBW RBW. For chirped readout the IBW is also the bandwidth that must be chirped over so that the chirp rate can be defined as IBW T. Chirp rates have units of Hz or alternatively Hz s and chirp rates over many orders of magnitude can be considered depending on the application and desired update rate UR . For example a typical chirp rate of 4 10Hzallows one to readout 20 GHz in 0.5 ms with an update rate of 2 kHz. The bandwidth of the photodetector PBW is typically desired to be much lower than IBW and is used to measure the optical intensity oscillations that arise from chirped readout. For a fixed the choice of PBW will then dictate the RBW of the signals of interest measured by the device. The relationships that show these tradeoffs are RBW PBW IBW T PBW IBW UR PBW. It is typical to choose a lower bandwidth photodetector with a bandwidth of about 50 200 MHz or lower so as to utilize the relatively high signal to noise ratio performance of these devices and to have the bandwidth of the photodetector well matched with the performance of analog to digital converters at 100 500 megasamples per second Ms s where 1 megsample Ms 10samples . Using an example of PBW 100 MHz and 4 10Hz then RBW 0.4 MHz. In this case N 20 000 MHz 0.4 MHz 50 000. So the tradeoff across a wide desired IBW with a high performance as set by PBW is really between update rate UR and resolution bandwidth RBW .

In some cases the SSH material can support wide bandwidth operation and simultaneously have an inherent material resolution bandwidth RBW where RBW

Another way to view the relationships between the factors 1 to 4 above is to define a ratio R IBW PBW. For IBW 20 GHz and PBW 100 MHz then R 200. This same ratio R will be the relationship between the RBW and UR as R RBW UR. So if UR 2 kHz then the RBW 200 2 kHz 0.4 MHz.

Alternatively a plurality of M readout waveforms interrogating different bandwidths in parallel spatial channels could achieve N times reduction of RBW for a fixed UR or visa versa.

In practice cooling the SSH crystal to temperatures of 3.0 K 4.5K nominally referred to as 4K has been readily achievable with the advent of cryogen free refrigerators closed cycle systems with no liquid helium that are commercially available from several vendors including those listed above. Cryocoolers in general are comprised of two main components the coldhead and the compressor. Compressors are kept remote from the coldhead with flexlines that provide a flow of helium gas to the coldhead. Typical lengths of the flexlines are 3 meters and longer lines can be used. These are turnkey systems that run on wall power and have long operation periods before maintenance. The term closed cycle indicates that the system is actually circulating helium gas and thus does not use liquid helium or liquid nitrogen as a part of the system. In fact these cryo refrigerator systems are much like a regular kitchen refrigerator each plugs into a wall electrical socket and using a compressor circulates a coolant helium gas . Each utilizes a thermal cycle at the coldhead to cool a small metallic coldfinger.

The SSH crystals can be used in any apparatus that cools them to the appropriate temperatures. Liquid helium cryocoolers are in the category of something that is possible to use but is not generally considered practical for applications where long duration of operation is desired without maintenance. For example in a liquid helium system liquid helium is added continuously at an disadvantageous cost and effort. Closed cycle systems by comparison do not have this requirement. Rather they consume wall power and run continuously and are typically maintained only on the order of every 10 000 hours.

For some optical processing applications about 100 milliwatts mW 1 mW 10Watts of cooling power are consumed per channel for a single channel device. However in parallel channel operation the SSH based processor has a significant advantage. Since one crystal can effectively handle dozens of parallel channels SSH based processing scales to lower cooling requirements per channel for parallel systems. For example a small sample of crystalline material and its mounting hardware is cooled to 4 K. Analog RF signals come into the 4 K stage as modulated optical laser beams through windows or on fiber optical cables so no cooling of RF cables is required. Likewise the readout process uses laser beams and thus the output is all optical. The main cooling function is to remove parasitic heating of the crystal.

For some systems a dampening of the vibrations in the coldhead to the crystal is advantageous. This is achieved with a low vibration stage added to the coldfinger with demonstrated dampening of the inherent vibration of the cold sample from 5 m 1 m also called a micron 10meters to less than 10 nanometers nm 1 nm 10meters with a small loss of base temperature. The cooler readily achieves 3.3 K operation with this stage see for example United States Published Patent Application 2010005066 listed in the references.

The mounting hardware of the doped crystal in the cryocooler that is used has been the subject of a related United States Published Patent Application 20100127148 listed in the references.

Spatial Spectral Holographic SSH materials also called Spatial Spectral S2 materials herein provide the core element that enables signal processing applications such as spectrum analysis direction finding correlative signal processing data storage or signal delay. There are several properties listed next that indicate a material is useful for such processing applications.

Material properties of interest include the following. 1 Composition indicates the chemical elements combined in the material which can be manufactured or grown with elements that are available in a rugged durable form factor typically a rare earth element doped into a crystalline lattice.

 2 High spatial quality indicates the uniformity of the material composition over the size of the crystal and depends on the host and dopant and growth technique. High spatial quality is desired so that laser light can effectively irradiate the atoms and not scatter and also so that output light be captured after irradiating the atoms.

 3 Absorption coefficient determines the rate at which photons carrying information are absorbed per unit length of the material given in units of cm. Absorption coefficient sets physical limit on the length L of the samples that is involved to get the product L and is in a range from about 1 to about 3 for useful applications.

 4 Instantaneous Bandwidth IBW of the atomic resonance is the bandwidth over which absorption occurs and is desired to be 1 GHz. Practical materials to date excluding current work show bandwidths of just over 20 GHz over a 3 dB deciBel full width a ratio X of absorption over maximum absorption is expressed as 10 logX deciBels dB . A width of 3 dB indicates the optical frequency band over which the absorption is within 3 dB of the maximum absorption. Materials with bandwidth 20 GHz over a 3 dB width are desired but were not available with a good combination of qualities before the work presented here.

 5 Wavelength of the atomic resonance is the wavelength at which maximum absorption occurs and is expressed in nanometers nm 1 nm 10meters . The wavelength of atomic resonance is practical when in the range of available lasers that can be used to irradiate the atomic transition and thus be effectively absorbed by the material.

 6 Temperature of operation is desired to be greater than about 3K for various applications but such temperatures are not readily found because cooling suppresses the phonon electron interactions in the material and warmer temperatures disadvantageously increase phonon electron interactions. Temperatures of operation are practical in the 3Krange when using cryo refrigerators also called cryocoolers herein that do not require a continuous supply of liquid Helium. Such temperatures are readily achieved with current commercial cryocoolers such as Gifford McMahon cryocoolers from vendors such as Sumitomo SHI Cryogenics of America Inc. in Allentown Pa. and Janis Research Company of Wilmington Mass. and Pulse Tube cryocoolers from vendors such as Cryomech Inc of Syracuse N.Y. . Temperatures of operation in a range less than 3 K which is outside of the operating range of these coolers and usually involve liquid Helium or other approaches to cooling are much less practical.

 7 Lifetime of the atomic transition is the time that the stored target analog spectrum representing the signals of interest will persist and is related to the average time the electrons of the dopant remain in an excited state before returning to the ground state. The lifetime is desired to be long enough to sufficiently interrogate the target analog spectrum e.g. about one millisecond in some applications without significant loss during the interrogation time.

 8 Resolution bandwidth RBW is the frequency difference between detectably distinct absorption features. It is desired to be as narrow as possible within the constraints imposed by application specific requirements and the material host and dopant dopant concentration growth technique temperature optical excitation power optical excitation bandwidth noise from mechanical vibrations external magnetic field and its strength and orientation among others. RBW is typically considered very advantageous when less than 0.01 MHz at temperatures below about 4 K. RBW is typically still advantageous when less than 1 MHz for applications at about 4K.

The absorption features of ions or molecules that are doped into inorganic or organic materials are spectrally broadened by two main classes of mechanisms. Homogeneous broadening is the fundamental broadening experienced by all ions or molecules independently and arises from a well known quantum mechanical relationship between a transition frequency line shape and a dephasing time of an excited electron in the ion or molecule. Inhomogeneous broadening refers to a quasi continuum of overlapping individual spectra of all of the ions or molecules in the material which have microscopically different environments and therefore slightly different transition frequencies. When the inhomogeneous broadening of a material is significantly larger than the homogeneous broadening of a material the material displays useful optical absorption properties and is called an inhomogeneously broadened transition IBT material. As described above such a material can be used to form spatial spectral gratings and is therefore also called a spatial spectral S2 material. The spatial spectral gratings can be used to store holographic data in which the output varies with the spatial mode of observations and so the material is also called a spatial spectral holographic SSH material. The latter term is used predominantly herein.

Doping of certain rare earth ions in inorganic materials in a certain way produces SSH materials that are useful in broadband signal processing applications. In various materials known in the art outside the current work the absorption demonstrates optical frequency selectivity over bandwidths typically far greater than 1 GHz and with frequency resolution typically orders of magnitude less than 1 MHz. The frequency resolution of an SSH material is typically referred to as the homogeneous linewidth of the material. The practical limit on the maximum duration of the analog signal that can be recorded in an SSH materials is roughly the reciprocal of the material s homogeneous linewidth. For example a material with a homogeneous linewidth of 1 MHz can record signals with duration up to roughly one microsecond. The maximum bandwidth that can be recorded by an SSH materials is roughly equal to the inhomogeneous bandwidth of the SSH material. For example an SSH material with inhomogeneous linewidth of 100 GHz can record signals with bandwidths up to 100 GHz.

The materials known to date outside the current work are typically a rare earth element doped into a host material where the host material is typically a crystalline structure. Other hosts such as various glasses etc are possible. Thus the desirable SSH material should exhibit a combination of properties that make its uses practical. These include high spatial quality wavelength of operation bandwidth of operation temperature of operation resolution bandwidth of operation and lifetime of the information storage. The materials known presently outside the current work that exhibit a proper combination of these properties for practical operation are limited. While many materials have been studied as cited in the references listed below the materials that have been used to date outside the current work for applications have been rather limited.

The frequency selectivity can be modified locally by interaction with optical signals that excite electrons in the ions which serve as absorbers from a ground state to an excited state thereby removing those electrons from the population of ground state absorbers at that location in the material. This creates a reduction in the absorption at the resonant frequency of these ions. Therefore some such materials have been used to form highly frequency selective spatial spectral gratings. After typically an electronic population lifetime the electrons may return to the ground state and the grating decays with a characteristic time called the population decay time. When electrons are removed from the ground state in a particular homogeneously broadened absorption peak a hole is said to be burned in the absorption of the material at the frequency of the hole and light at the frequency of the hole is transmitted with substantially less absorption. A spectral hole is an example of the simplest spectral feature that can be recorded and combinations of spectral holes at different frequencies with varying depths are here denoted as spectral features or spectral gratings. The lifetime of the spectral features is determined by the time it takes for the absorbers in the system to return to their equilibrium state. Spectral features may be made permanent in some systems.

The energy level diagram for Thulium number 69 on periodic table is shown in . is a block diagram that illustrates example optical photon absorption by Thulium according to an embodiment. Thulium has a nominal 793 nm transition between a ground state H and an excited state H which varies with material host. This means that a photon with approximately 793 nm wavelength is absorbed by an electron in the ground state energy level and is accelerated to the stable excited state where it resides on average for a lifetime of about 0.8 milliseconds ms . Depending on the host material the electron returns directly to the ground state by emitting a photon of the same wavelength or returns indirectly passing through two intermediate states a short lifetime about 1 microsecond s intermediate state H and a long lived 10 millisecond ms state F called the bottleneck state . The branching ratio indicates the percentage of the excited atoms that decay to the useful bottleneck state . When an atom of Thulium is in the bottleneck state photons of wavelength 793 nm are not effectively absorbed.

The use of the rare earth element Thulium as a dopant has created useful materials. One of these Tm YAlOor Tm YAG is a well known and studied material with concentrations of 0.1 at. or 0.05 at. or lower. This material has been a preferred SSH crystal material to date outside the current work for its combined collective properties that make it practical and useful.

Tm YAG crystals are typically grown using the well known Czochralski method. High optical quality ultra high purity crystals with very low loss from scattering have been grown. Such crystals can be characterized as to their optical purity by measuring the optical signal losses for a light beam that is not resonant with any absorption feature. An ultra high purity crystal can exhibit losses as low as 10 parts per million per centimeter of material length ppm cm or 0.001 cm loss. Low scattering loss material is important in many optical processing applications as it impacts both the ability to irradiation the Thulium ions as well as the ability to detect the output light. In addition these crystals can be produced with impurity and defect levels at the level of 1 part per million ppm or lower. Tm YAG components utilized in SSH based signal processing applications to date outside the current work have typically had scattering losses of less than 1000 ppm cm 0.1 cm and impurity levels in the range of 1 10 ppm but some SSH based signal processing applications could benefit from these higher quality materials.

As light travels through crystalline materials the spatial uniformity of an optical beam can also be distorted. As such the overall spatial uniformity of the material can impact device performance in SSH based applications. The uniformity of a given crystalline sample is impacted by a number of factors including the growth conditions and region of the crystal used. The change in the uniformity of an optical beam through a material is measured using an interferometer and is typically expressed as a transmitted wavefront distortion in waves at the wavelength 632.8 nm. Typical Tm YAG components for SSH based applications have had a spatial uniformity of better than 10 although higher uniformity can be achieved if enough effort is expended.

The use of a particular SSH material Tm YAG has been in the public domain for nearly two decades. The useful properties of Tm YAG are summarized here. The composition is Thulium doped YAG Tm YAlOalso expressed as Tm YAG or Tm YAG. Thulium is the dopant with atomic transition H Hof interest. Thulium doping levels are about 0.05 at. to about 0.1 at. . Host is YAG Yttrium Aluminum Garnet YAlO. Spatial quality is high when grown using the Czochralski method and with low levels of impurities in the 1 ppm level or lower. Low scattering loss as low as 10 100 ppm cm has been achieved with high spatial uniformity of 10 or better for 632.8 nm light. Absorption coefficient of about 1.0 cmfor 0.05 at. doping leads to physical lengths of samples of about 1 cm to about 10 cm being practical where the light beam is relatively uniform through the sample and for which the sample can be practically mounted in a cryocooler. IBW of about 17 GHz at 3 dB width have been achieved. Wavelength of the atomic resonance is 793.38 nm well within range of available lasers. Temperature of operation is about 4K for the properties listed here. Lifetime of the atomic transition is about 0.8 ms in upper state and about 10 ms at the bottleneck state when no external magnetic field is applied. RBW is typically about 0.018 MHz at 3.5 K at short times 0.01 ms and about 0.028 MHz at 3.5 K at long times 1 ms . RBW is typically about 0.4 MHz with excitation broadening which assumes 50 excitation of all atoms across about 20 GHz bandwidth. Some of these properties are summarized in the table of described below.

Some of the materials knowledge to date outside the current work is in the public domain and is presented here as background information. This presentation serves to identify what is the new and non obvious contributions of the current work. The materials are identified as Tm YAG dopant densities of 0.05 at. or 0.1 at. Tm YLuAG dopant density of 3 at. with 50 of the Y in YAG replaced by Lu and Thulium doped in a crystal of Lithium Niobate Tm LiNbO shortened to Tm LN References 1 2 3 cover these materials as well as some unpublished material measurements 4 that were derived from fundamental research efforts.

To put some embodiments in more context comparisons can be made to Tm LN doping density of Thulium of about 0.1 at. which show several interesting material properties but at this point in time the material is not as promising for the SSH optical processing application space and has been studied previously in detail and these results are publically known and published 3 . The absorption coefficient is 14 cm and the 3 dB bandwidth of 300 GHz with an absorption line that shows a very disordered host. However these two attributes by themselves are not sufficient for use as a practical SSH material. The unattractive attributes measured are the following. The lifetime of the excited state is short 150 microseconds due to the higher oscillator strength. The material s inherent linewidth at 3.5 K is 200 kHz. The resolution bandwidth broadening with excitation or instantaneous spectral diffusion ISD has been partially measured and those results show it is disadvantageously high although not fully quantified.

A new SSH material has been characterized with useful properties for optical processing. This new material is Thulium doped into a host Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet Tm YLuAG in which Lutetium occurs in the crystal on the same order of magnitude as Yttrium e.g. about 10 to 90 of the binding positions on the crystal of which 3 binding positions occur on each AlOnode of the crystal . The work performed has characterized this material at temperatures between about 3 K and produced breakthrough results for new functionality that shows a surprisingly impressive 270 GHz 3 dB bandwidth with other useful properties. Specifically this material exhibits high spatial quality a wavelength of about 793.8 nm a temperature of operation of 3K and a good spectral resolution of 

The composition of one embodiment is Thulium doped Yttrium Lutetium Aluminum Garnet Tm YLuAG or more generally Tm YLuAlO x 0 x typically 1.5 or in a nominal range of about 0.1 x about 2.9 .

Thulium is the dopant with atomic transition H Hof interest. Based on the new measurements presented here it is anticipated that Tm doping levels of 0.1 3.0 atomic percent at. are useful and practical for optical processing where dopant levels less than about 3.0 at. are expected to have better resolution linewidth and instantaneous spectral diffusions properties than that tested. Furthermore lower dopant levels are anticipated to give better linewidth and coherence properties.

Other Lutetium concentrations x of Tm YLuAlOare possible and useful with less bandwidth and other properties expected to be similar to YAlO.

As tested to date material host was YLuAlO indicating 50 Yttrium and 50 Lutetium e.g. doping at 3.0 at. in x 1.5 host material. This material was grown utilizing the Czochralski method with low levels of impurities similar to Tm YAG. This material shows high optical spatial quality with low scattering loss and high spatial uniformity similar to Tm YAG. This material showed absorption coefficient cc of about 3.8 cm for the 3.0 at. dopant level. Measured population decay due to the relaxation of the upper Hstate to the bottleneck state shows a very high branching ratio approaching 100 or 1.0 with a model for a distribution of Thulium ions with excited state lifetimes ranging between 20 to 530 microseconds s . A long lifetime of about 17 ms was measured for the bottleneck state with no external magnetic field applied. Resolution bandwidth RBW for the 3.0 at. dopant level was measured typically about 0.025 MHz at 3.5 K at wait times of 0.01 ms and typically about 0.052 MHz at longer wait times of 1 ms. These measurements imply that RBW is expected to be typically 

Some of the physical and spectroscopic properties of these materials are described graphically in . is a graph that illustrates absorption properties of example materials as a function of optical wavelength according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis is optical wavelength in nanometers. The vertical axis is relative absorption coefficient in inverse centimeters. Trace depicts absorption coefficient for Tm LN and points depicts the reduction of the echo intensity. Trace depicts absorption coefficient for Tm YLuAG Tm dopant concentration of 3 at offset vertically to avoid obscuring the results. Trace depicts absorption coefficient for Tm YAG Tm dopant concentration of 0.05 at offset vertically again to avoid obscuring the results. Tm YLuAG shows surprisingly much broader IBW than Tm YAG with a peak absorption moved toward longer wavelengths near 794 nm.

In this figure the resonance frequency bandwidth absorption coefficient and lineshape of the Hto Htransition of Thulium are described.

The 3.0 at. Tm doping material of Tm YLuAG was characterized and is being used to estimate performance for lower doping densities. For this material there are 60 more Tm atoms in the YLuAG host as compared to 0.05 at. Tm in YAG and there is 15 times more bandwidth. On a per bandwidth basis there are 4 times more atoms in the Tm YLuAG material. This new study thus indicates that Tm YLuAG is a desired new material with useful and non obvious properties especially for Thulium dopant concentrations less than 3.0 at. .

Another surprising result is that the branching ratio approaches almost 100 with a distribution of upper state lifetimes. The bottleneck shows a somewhat surprising twofold increase for Tm YLuAG as compared to Tm YAG 17 ms versus 10 ms . The material resolution bandwidth RBW measurements showed good overall performance and trends with the inherent 2 pulse photon echo measurements giving a RBW of roughly fourfold wider for the 3.0 at. Tm YLuAG as compared to 0.05 at. Tm YAG. This RBW measurement is anticipated to be lower at lower Tm per bandwidth concentration. The RBW was quite uniform across the absorption bandwidth. The broadening of the RBW with external excitation shows good overall trending with the effect of instantaneous spectral diffusion ISD effect being higher for 3.0 at. Tm YLuAG 4 in RBW with full excitation of the measurements but still surprisingly 1 MHz as has been observed in some materials with wideband absorption. Much higher effects of ISD were expected in the 3.0 at. Tm YLuAG material by the inventors with the inherent 60 more Tm atoms in the host.

It is anticipated that further advantages may be achieved at lower concentration of Thulium than the 3.0 at. in YLuAG with the tradeoffs of physical length of the material to get a product of aL that can be reasonably mounted in a cryocooler and interact with a laser beam. At the present time a physical length constraint of about 3.0 cm is imposed by use in practical cryocoolers. Much longer samples can be employed in other embodiments. For this case a Tm YLuAG material with a Thulium dopant level of 0.5 at. 6 times less Tm into the same YLuAG host is anticipated to yield material characterization with a lower RBW and a lower RBW broadening and could use a 3.0 cm sample length. For both lower RBW and lower RBW broadening the use of lower concentrations of Thulium in some embodiments is advantageous because the lower concentrations are anticipated to approach or perhaps improve upon the RBW and RBW broadening for Tm YAG and would provide performance like or better than Tm YAG over a wider bandwidth.

Thus the usefulness of Tm YLuAG above about 3 K has been established with results that show good properties over a bandwidth that is surprisingly much wider than that of Tm YAG that are not previously known or published. The properties of a lower dopant level Tm YLuAG material in some embodiments are anticipated to be even better than those measured in the experimental embodiments.
