Designing the layout and products to include in a room can be a time consuming process. For example a person designing a room can select various products to include in the room by collecting pages from magazines or from the internet. The person designing the room can later view these pages when selecting a product to purchase. The person designing the room may also use a computer aided design CAD program or tool to generate a computer based layout of the room that includes the placement of various items within the room. If the person designing the room has questions about the items to include in the room or the layout of the room he she may ask a salesperson at a store about products or ask friends for recommendations or opinions about various aspects of his her design.

The typical homeowner will spend months planning a home improvement project. The result can be an unorganized collection of pages torn out of magazines and catalogs stacks of books with bookmarked pages lengthy Internet Explorer Favorites lists with poor naming conventions and sketches of designs that are not to scale.

The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Further features aspects and advantages are apparent in the description the drawings and the claims.

After the user has selected the product for which to generate the visual bookmark the home design tool extracts information about the user selected home design product from the website on which the product is displayed . In some implementations the home design tool extracts the information by comparing what information was previously chosen to be extracted by other users that bookmarked the same page. The home design tool performs an initial product categorization based on the extracted information . The home design tool uses the initial categorization to extract information product specific information from the website . In some implementations the type of information extracted is based on the product categorization. For example the information extracted for a kitchen sink may differ from the information extracted for cabinets or floor tiling. The product categorization and the product information extracted by the home design tool are presented to the user for review . The user reviews the categorization and other extracted information and either confirms the information is adequate or provides updated information about the home design product. The home design tool receives the confirmation or updated information about the home design product from the user and generates a visual book mark for the selected home design product based on the extracted category and information .

This visual bookmark generation process is based on the integration of web scraping and extraction technology. The home design tool that executes the bookmark generation process is a hybrid taxonomy and folksonomy based system built for bookmarking anything related to the home improvement industry including products design ideas and articles. In general folksonomy is an Internet based information retrieval methodology comprised of collaboratively generated open ended labels that categorize content on the web. In contrast a taxonomy based system is a hierarchical tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. Taxonomy based system use a pre established controlled vocabulary.

The home design tool combines aspects of both taxonomy and folksonomy. For example the categorization of a home design product selected by a user is categorized into pre defied categories of product types and thus relies on a taxonomy based system. It is believed that using a taxonomy based system to categorize the home design product can provide various advantages such as offering a standard categorization schema that allows users to browse a directory of public visual bookmarks simplifying product searches simplifying and or automating the process of associating the correct 2D drawing and 3D models with the bookmark identifying key characteristics of the product and or using this to refine the properties of the associated 2D drawing and 3D model. While the categorization of the product is based on a taxonomy based system the information included in the visual bookmark for the home design product is based on a folksonomy based system. As such the information in the visual bookmark is gathered from the information available on the website of the selected home design product. The tags for the visual bookmark are generated using a folksonomy based system to further describe the product characteristics including style color and dimensional information. It is believed that using a folksonomy based system to for collecting and displaying additional information about the home design product can provide various advantages such as offering a more open ended system for categorizing products based on more detailed information such as the finish and color of the product the pattern the style the construction type the material s and other options listed above offering a tag based system to simply and refine searches for visual bookmarks created by other users offering complementary system to the taxonomy based directory of public visual bookmarks allowing users to refine their product browsing with tags and or providing a more detailed information for associating the correct 2D CAD drawing and 3D CAD model with a visual bookmark.

The taxonomy based categorization and folksonomy based tags can be used to build intelligence for the home design tool. As users collect products design ideas and articles the home design system uses a neural network to learn and identify the correct taxonomy based categories and folksonomy based tags.

For example in the home design system automatically categorized the sink as a home product as shown in box . In addition the home design tool extracted various information about the sink such as the product type as shown in box the size as shown in box the color as shown in box and the price as shown in box . If any of this information is incorrect the user can modify the information. For example if the price of the sink were 250 rather than 542.25 as extracted by the home design tool the user could enter the correct price of 250 into box . The home design tool would record the change in the price for the home design product made by the user. The visual book marks are stored in a database and available for others to view. Subsequently if another user selects the same sink the home design tool could use this information to initially provide the correct price of 250 to the user.

In some examples the user may modify information such that the correct information is changed to be incorrect. For example in the size of the sink is accurately shown as 33 22. However the user may change the size of the sink to be 12 12 or any other incorrect dimension. This may cause the home design tool to subsequently display the information entered by the user e.g. 12 12 rather than the correct information extracted from the website. However when this happens the user will correct the information. As such over time the responses of the users of the system will show that the correct size of the sink is 33 22 and the system will learn to display this information for the sink dimensions in spite of the incorrect information entered by one of the users.

In some implementations the home design system can use neural networks as described to follow. The system scans the page for the initial taxonomy based criteria. Once identified the system uses the taxonomy based criteria to scan a database of words and phrases identified to be key characteristics of the taxonomy based product type. The system also uses the taxonomy based criteria to scan the database of tags used by previous users to identify not only a particular page product but tags used to describe bookmarks within the same taxonomy based product category. The system uses these words to scan the page for these phrases and words and presents the user with a list of potential tags for further folksonomy based categorization of the product.

Referring back to the home design tool groups the visual bookmarks according to product category and product type. For example webpage includes a menu of collections of visual bookmarks generated by the user. The visual bookmarks are organized into categories based on the product categorization and into subcategories based on the type of the product. Exemplary product categories include appliances e.g. as indicated by arrow kitchen cabinets e.g. as indicated by arrow plumbing fixtures e.g. as indicated by arrow flooring appliances building structure cabinets storage floors walls counters furniture accessories landscape outdoor lighting plumbing and other. Each of these product categories can be sub divided into particular types of products. An exemplary subdivision of product categories into particular types of products is shown to follow 

For example the category of plumbing fixtures can include products types such as faucets sinks and tubs e.g. as indicated by arrows and respectively . It is believed that arranging the visual bookmarks into product categories and product types can provide various advantages such as making the information more easily accessible for the user to search for these products or browse a product directory based on these types of categories.

Webpage also includes information about products not selected as visual bookmarks by the user. For example webpage includes similar user collections . The similar user collections include other items that are similar to the items selected by the user. The user can access the similar user collections to view other products without having to sort through the large volumes of information available on the internet. The home design tool determines home design products to include in the similar user collections based on the products for which the user has generated visual bookmarks. For example as shown in the user had generated bookmarks for various dual basin sinks. As such the similar user collections could include dual basin sinks available from other manufacturers and selected as visual bookmarks by other users. The system uses the taxonomy based product categorization and the folksonomy based tags to identify similar products.

Webpage also includes sponsored links . In general sponsored links are links to products by a particular manufacturer associated with the type of products that the user has bookmarked. The manufacturer may pay a fee to have the sponsored links displayed in order to advertise their brand or their particular products.

Webpage also includes text based web advertisements . These advertisements can be sponsored by various companies or organizations. The displayed advertisements are selected by the home design tool based on the information about the type of products the user has generated visual bookmarks for. For example in the user had generated visual bookmarks for various types of sinks and the information presented in the web advertisements is related to the general category of sinks. Both the text and image based advertisements may include similar products using the same taxonomy based product categorization and the folksonomy based tags to identify similar products in the advertising inventory. In some implementations advertisers can choose product categories and products tags required for their advertisements to appear in the system.

The taxonomy based categorization the folksonomy based tags and user activity tracking offer the foundation for the system s product search algorithms. Users may type a product name and characteristics into the search field. The system identifies and prioritizes the most popular product bookmarks for the specific terms based on what product categories and tags they assigned to the product how many users have bookmarks these products how many users have incorporated these products within their designs and how many users have viewed these products in other users collections and within other users designs. The algorithm relies heavily on how many users incorporate the bookmark into their designs since this shows that the user may actually purchase the product. Advertisements may also appear in search results using similar criteria as bookmarks. If the advertisers assign a specific URL to an ad the system will include both visual bookmarks and advertisement selections for the same product as part of the prioritization calculation for the products. After typing a search term into the search field specifying that the users is searching for products and clicking the search button the system presents the user with results based on the algorithm outlined above. On the left side of the screen the user is presented with options to refine the search. For example if a users types in two basin sink within the search box the results appear and on the left side of the system automatically assigns a product category of plumbing and a product type of sink. The system may also present the user with the product style of two basin as a taxonomy based categorization or as a folksonomy based tag. Tags extracted from and most commonly shared among the search results are presented to user. These tags are shared characteristics of the product as outlined above in the description of potential tags. The user may select these tags such as self rimming an installation type to refine the search results to sinks that are self rimming meaning they are installed through the top of a counter. The user may also refine the importance of search criteria such as price size and specific tags. Specific tags may be selected from a list to be added to a search slide bar. Users may adjust the search sliders to adjust the importance of each criteria. These importance parameters are used as coefficients in search algorithm to raise or lower the weight of different metrics in search results.

As described above the home design tool allows a user to collect information about home design products and use the information for designing a room or multiple rooms. In the create mode a user can generate a design for a particular room or rooms using the home design products collected in the collect mode. In order to allow users to add the products for which they generated visual bookmarks into a room design the home design tool uses information collected in the collect mode about a home design product to associate and modify two dimensional and three dimensional computer aided design CAD models from the system s database to the specifications of the product.

An additional implementation may include interpreting an image and transforming the image into a 3D model. This will be used for products that may not be included in the site s database of CAD models. For example if the user bookmarks a lamp and the system does not have a lamp in the database the system will prompt the user to create a 3D model of the image. For a tall floor lamp the system would identify the edges of the object and prompt the user to verify that the edges are correct or incorrect. The user can select nodes to move the vector based shape around the image and identify the shape of the image. The user may also draw a closed shape around objects. Once identified the user may select how they would like the system to convert the image into 3D. The user could browse the directory of CAD model in the system create her own design or use the image as a basis for the CAD model. For example with a tall floor lamp the system would identify the edges of the lamp and remove other graphics from the picture. The user could then use the revolve tool to revolve the image of the lamp around a vertical axis to create a 3D version of the product. The cropped image also becomes a texture map that may be applied to the 3D model. Tools used for creating a model from scratch may include lines arcs circles rectangles polygons 3D box spheres cylinder cones toruses wedges revolve tools sweep tools 3D poly lines 3D splines and other standard CAD drawing tools.

It is believed that generating CAD models for images found on the internet can provide various advantages. For example since the home design tool makes the entire Web a content source for two dimensional CAD drawing and three dimensional CAD models of products the users of the home design tool can select and use any home design product in designing a layout and is not constrained to manufacturers that offer CAD models for their products in specific formats. The user is not constrained to manufacturers that provide CAD models because the CAD model matching and modification process identifies key characteristics of products based on information available on the home design product s website and converts this information into CAD models that represent the style color and dimensional information of the product.

The taxonomy based categorization and folksonomy based tags used to associate the CAD models with the home design product selected by the user build the intelligence for the system which helps the system to correctly identify which CAD drawings and models to associate with a particular home design product. As described above when a user adds this visual bookmark to a CAD drawing the system presents the user with a selection of the closest matching CAD files two dimensional and or three dimensional CAD models to associate with the visual bookmark. shows a process for building intelligence and using the intelligence about selected CAD design choices to provide more accurate selections to a user. As users associate the various CAD models drawings with a specific Web page and product information the system records which CAD model is selected the most frequently . The system also records what properties from the visual bookmark like size and color are used to modify the model in the database . The home design tool uses this recorded information to update a ranking of the CAD models and prioritizes CAD model choices presented to the user for future bookmarks accordingly as well as update the properties of the presented CAD model .

The home design tool allows the user to insert home design products into a home design layout e.g. layout by dragging the image of the product from section into the desired location. For example in the user has selected the image of sink and placed the sink into the layout as indicated by sink in the layout . After the user has placed the home design product into the layout the home design tool replaces the image of the home design product with the associated CAD drawing of the home design product e.g. as shown by CAD model in .

In some implementations once placed the object remains selected and a properties palette on the right side of the screen appears allowing the user to confirm the size and color of the sink or change it and see the properties update. In some additional implementations the user selects the visual bookmark to be inserted and the properties palette appears prompting the user to verify the correct options are selected such as color and size. Once the user selects the properties a 2D 3D model is parametrically generated by automatically modifying the original model in the database to the properties specifications from the original bookmark or based on user input. The user may now drag the 2D 3D model into his her design.

As shown in after the home design tool has replaced the image of the home design product e.g. as shown in with the CAD model of the home design product e.g. as shown in the user can view information relating to the home design product by moving a cursor over the CAD model . For example as shown in when the user positions their mouse over the CAD model a message appears that includes the visual bookmark information associated with the CAD model and the selected home design product. It is believed that this can be beneficial because the user can easily view information and an image of each home design product that has been added to a room s layout.

While in the implementations described above in relation to the home design tool associates the CAD model with a product selected by the user at the time the visual bookmark is generated other implementations are possible. For example in some implementations the potential CAD models may be presented to the user when the user attempts to add the bookmarked home design product to a layout. Associating the CAD model with the home design product at the time the product is added to a room layout can provide the advantage of requiring the user to select a CAD model only for the products they choose to add to the layout rather than for each product for which the user generates a visual bookmark.

While in the implementation described above the system associates a CAD model with a user generated bookmark other implementations are possible. In some implementations the user specifies a generic 2D CAD drawing 3D CAD model to place in their design. The system scans the database of visual bookmarks that other users have matched to the specific CAD model and presents the user with a prioritized list of visual bookmarks. The system also scans the database of the entire database of advertisements that have CAD models associated with the advertisements. The system also presents the user with a prioritized list of image and text based products advertisements. The user then selects which visual bookmark or advertisement to associate with the CAD model.

In order to provide the user with a visual representation of the floor and other surface coverings the home design tool performs texture mapping of a product selected from a website based on an image extracted from the website. It is believed that providing texture mapping based on an image selected from the internet can provide various advantages such as allowing a user to view any product they find displayed on the internet rather than limiting the user to manufacturers who have provided texture mapping materials or models with texture maps associated with them.

In some implementations the system prompts the user with a preview of what the texture map might look like and automatically crops the image to make a consistent texture map or prompt the user to crop the image to make a consistent texture map. The system can also include hatching patterns to select firm that represent how the texture maps. For example for 12 tile the user would select a hatch pattern named 12 that has lines spaced about 12 apart vertically and horizontally. The allows for grout. The user may overlay the hatch pattern over the image and further align the hatch to the image. This is turn defines how the image will be repeated when mapped onto a surface. Another option is to interpret the image directly from the website and use a combination of the taxonomy based categorization folksonomy based tags and neural network based learning to identify what type of repetitive characteristics and other properties of a texture. Then the information would be used to explore whether the texture meets these properties by comparing the pixels of the image with a vector based hatch pattern such as a grid defining a tile or a pattern in some implementations the system can use the pixels of the image to identify the correct repetitive characteristics of the image. In order to do so the application will perform vectorization of the image using edge detection algorithms i.e. Canny algorithm based on intensity jumps detection . If the vectors detected during this processing can be treated as texture mapping direction lines then they are suggested to the user as an option for texture mapping.

The system may also include sample objects for defining how the texture will map around surfaces like couches and chairs. For example a stripped fabric could map in multiple directions to a couch. The system will provide tools for toggling how the texture maps to sample objects which in turn will define how the texture maps to 2D 3D CAD models in the design. The home design tool uses the information extracted from the product website in addition to the information received in response to the user prompt to map the texture to a surface by replicating the image to cover the surface and wrapping the image around a surface if required .

When the user goes into create mode after receiving the information from the user the home design tool maps the texture to a surface. For example as shown in the user could map the tile texture onto the floor of the three dimensional view of the room . For example if the room was ten foot by ten foot the home design tool could determine that the size of the image corresponded to a two foot by two foot e.g. each tile is 12 inches by 12 inches and there are four tiles . As such as shown in the home design tool could size the image appropriately to replicate the image times e.g. 5 rows and 5 columns to produce the effect of the texture appropriately sized for the surface.

While in the example above the amount of area to be covered by one repetition of the image was discernable based on the size of the tile and the number of tiles shown in the image in some examples the size is not easily determined from the image. For example as shown in a user may select a non regularly repeating texture such as carpeting. In this example the user has selected an image of a carpet from a carpet manufacturer s website . The home design tool generates a pop up window requesting input from the user. The home design tool automatically populates the category and product type for confirmation by the user e.g. as shown in boxes and . Since it may be difficult for the user to identify the expected scale of the carpet shown in the image the home design tool displays various representative sized images of a similar type of carpet. For example as shown in window the home design tool presents a near view image of the carpet a moderately sized image of the carpet and a large area image of the carpet . The user selects the appropriate scale of the carpet in the image by comparing the image to the differently sized images and and selecting the appropriate button or .

The taxonomy based categorization and folksonomy based tags build the intelligence for the system helping it identify which tag prompts to display for specific URLs and assist in mapping textures properly. As shown in as users associate the various properties with images textures collected from a specific Web page the system records the information and learns which properties are selected the most often and prioritizes user choices for texture mapping accordingly .

It is believed that generating texture models for images found on the internet can provide various advantages. For example since the home design tool makes the entire Web a content source for the texture maps the users of the tool can select and use any carpeting paint tiles hardwood marble and the like in designing a layout and is not constrained to manufacturers that offer texture models for their products. In addition the system provides a search feature for textures contributed by other users. As outlined above for product searches the taxonomy based categorization the folksonomy based tags and user activity tracking offers a similar foundation for the system s texture search algorithms.

As described above in addition to enabling a user to collect product information e.g. by creating visual bookmarks and enabling the user to create room layouts that include the selected product information the home design tool also allows the user to collaborate with other users regarding various home design issues. For example the user can collaborate with other users by searching of products that other users have selected or viewing room designs that other users have generated. In general when a user creates a product collection or generates a floor plan the user can select whether or not to make a product collection or the floor plan available for others to view.

When a user shares their design other users can view not only the CAD drawing of the room but also the home design products that the user has selected to place within the design. In addition to the CAD design the home design tool displays images of the home design products included in the design. For example in the home design tool displays an image of the refrigerator in the CAD drawing an image of the tile included in the CAD drawing an image of the sink included in the CAD drawing and an image of the cabinets included in the CAD drawing . As shown in in addition to providing the images and of the home design products the home design tool can allow the person viewing the design to see additional information relating to the home design product by moving a cursor over the product in the CAD model . For example when the user positions their mouse over the CAD model of the sink a message appears that includes the visual bookmark information associated with the CAD model for the sink. It is believed that this can be beneficial because the user can easily view information about a home design product that another user has included in the room design without searching for the information themselves.

In addition to viewing room designs generated by other users in some implementations the home design tool allows users to search a database of room designs generated by other users to find rooms with similar floor plans. For example as shown in in collaborate mode the home design tool provides the user with a list of similar designs and the ability to search. The similar designs are designs with similar floor plans e.g. similar room shape room dimensions window placement door openings and or door placements that have been generated by other users of the system. Similar designs may also be found by using taxonomy based and folksonomy based tags that users have assigned to their entire floorplan individual rooms and products in the design. For example a user may choose artisan country contemporary hip or traditional for a design style from the taxonomy based lists of design styles. The user may also choose add folksonomy based tags like breakfast nook colonial island mud room entrance pantry to identify some characteristics of his her design. Lastly the system may generate searchable tags based on the characteristics of the designs. For example if the user draws a center island in his her design the system may tag the design with words like island and center island . Similar algorithms are used to search for entire floor plans.

Designs and are exemplary designs included in a list of similar designs for the room design shown in CAD model . While the designs included in the similar designs may not perfectly match the floor plan of the room designed by the user they can still provide valuable information about how other users have organized the layout and design of a similar room. If a user desires to view one of the designs included in the list of similar designs the user selects the design from the list and the design is displayed by the home design tool. For example as shown in if the user selects design the home design tool would present the CAD model associated with design and the products and included in the CAD model for the user to view. When the user navigates to a design previously included in the list of similar designs the home design tool adds the previously viewed design to the list of similar designs e.g. the previously viewed CAD model is included as a design in the list of similar designs for the CAD model .

For example in one implementation as shown in the user can provide a CAD model of the floor plan. From the CAD design the home design tool can extract the location of doors wall openings windows as well as the shape and dimensions of the room. In general vector graphics also referred to as geometric modeling or object oriented graphics is based on the use of geometrical primitives such as points lines carves and polygons which are all based upon mathematical equations to represent images in computer graphics. Vector graphics differs from raster graphics which is the representation of images as a collection of pixels dots .

As shown in in another implementation the user can provide information about the floor plan in the form of a sketch of the room. For example the user can sketch the room using their mouse or other computer input tool. In the search sketch pad the user can draw walls and add windows doors and wall openings. The search algorithm first looks for rooms that have a similar shape such as L shaped or rectangular Next the system identifies rooms that have a similar dimensions for the room walls closets may be ignored . Next the system identifies similar window door and wall opening locations. In addition the system compares the users collections with products visual bookmarks within the search results and prioritizes them based on similarity. The results of the search are based on a set of heuristically defined metrics for the design and should not necessarily result in only exact matches. Close matches are also reported to the user.

In some implementations the user can set importance of search criteria such as room dimensions wall window and wall openings and similarity of objects in the design to the users collections to find designs with similar tastes and dimensional information. These importance parameters are used as coefficients in search algorithm to raise or lower the weight of different metrics in search results.

The taxonomy based categorization of room names the folksonomy based tags for assigning criteria to rooms and user activity tracking offer the foundation for the system s product search algorithms. Users may type a room name and characteristics into the search field. The system identifies and prioritizes the most popular room designs for the specific terms based on what room categories and tags a user assigned to the design how many users have bookmarks these designs how many users have incorporated these room designs within their own designs and how many users have viewed the designs. The algorithm relies primarily on the shape size and similar products variables as outlined above. At the second level the system relies heavily on how many users incorporate another user s design into their designs since this shows that this design is popular. Advertisements entire room designs created by advertisers may also appear in search results using similar criteria as to other users designs. Advertisements that are already incorporated in other designs will also be included in the calculation even if the design was edited. After typing a search term into the search field specifying that the user is searching for designs and clicking the search button the system presents the user with results based on the algorithm outlined above. On the left side of the screen the user is presented with options to refine the search. For example if a user types in L shaped kitchen within the search box the results appear and on the left side of the system automatically assigns a room name of kitchen and a tag of L shaped. The system may also present the user with the design styles like artisan country contemporary hip traditional. These styles are taxonomy based characteristics assigned to design by the users at the time of creation. Additional options for refining search results are outline below.

It is believed that allowing a user to search for designs based on a sketch can provide the advantage of allowing the user to easily search for related floor plans without having to commit the time and effort of generating an entire room design. In addition it offers a unique advertising opportunity for advertisers to offer complete room designs all with brand name products that they manufacture or sell.

As shown in in another implementation the user can provide information about the floor plan by inputting information about the room plan using a text based user interface . For example the user can enter information about the room type shape and square footage . In some implementations in order to better refine the information about the room the home design tool can present the user with exemplary room layouts e.g. layouts and based on the limited information such that the user can select the room design most similar to what they are attempting to design. The exemplary room layouts presented to the user can be based on room layouts that are frequently viewed or are included in the system that match the criteria input by the user.

For example the home design tool can receive one or more inputs from the user that rank or select properties of room designs that can be used to sort the search results. This searching allows the user to view room designs that are most similar in shape and or design to their room based on the received inputs.

The design tool allows the user to enter the type of floorplan they are searching for. For example the user can search for either a room or an entire floor plan as indicated by arrow . In order to select either the room or floor plan as the type of design for which the user is searching the user clicks on the appropriate button in the home design tool.

The user can also enter a room type that can be used to further limit the search results presented to the user as indicated by arrow . By entering the room type the user can view only rooms that will be used for the same function as their intended use of a room. For example if a user is searching for kitchen designs it can be beneficial to present only kitchens having similar shape and design to the room rather than present bedrooms or other types of rooms. Exemplary room types include bedroom bathroom living room kitchen study play room dining room and the like.

The home design tool also allows the user to enter the basic shape of the design e.g. as described above in relation to . In some implementations the home design tool includes a search sketchpad . The search sketchpad is a tool that allows the user to enter the general shape of the room and any doors using door button windows using window button and other openings e.g. using openings button .

In addition to the type of room as indicated by arrow and the general shape of the room entered in the sketchpad other information can be used to further limit the search results. For example information about the importance of various search criteria can be entered for example based on a slider bar for each type of information that ranks the importance of that feature. The home design tool uses the information about the importance of the various features to filter the search results. As shown in the user can select the amount of relevance the home design tool places on the dimensions of the room as indicated by slider bar . If the slider bar is moved to indicate a greater emphasis on the dimensions of the room e.g. moved to the right the home design tool will limit the displayed search results to rooms having dimensions more closely matched to the dimensions entered by the user. The user can also select the amount of relevance the home design tool places on the openings of the room such as any doors or windows as indicated by slider bar . If the slider bar is moved to indicate a greater emphasis on the openings present in the room e.g. moved to the right the home design tool will limit the displayed search results to rooms having openings more closely matched to the openings entered by the user. The user can select the amount of relevance the home design tool places on the products in their collection of visual bookmarks as indicated by slider bar . This allows the user to limit the search results to designs with similar products as those that have been gathered and selected by the user. If the slider bar is moved to indicate a greater emphasis on the matching the types of products e.g. moved to the right the home design tool will limit the displayed search results to rooms that include home design products more closely matched to the home design products stored in the user s collection of visual bookmarks. It is believed that allowing the user to limit the displayed search results based on the types of products they have stored in their visual bookmarks can provide the advantage of allowing the user to more easily locate designs that may be of interest to him her. For example if the user has generated visual bookmarks for products with a very contemporary style they are not likely to have interest in a rustic country themed design. As such by filtering the results based on the visual bookmarks of the user the user may be presented with results that have a more contemporary feel.

The room dimensions room openings and type of home design products can be used to filter the search results e.g. as indicated by slider bars and respectively . Other characteristics could be used in addition or instead of these features.

In some implementations e.g. as shown in the user can refine the search results to display rooms with particular characteristics. For example a user might desire to have a contemporary feel to the room. In order to filter the results to show rooms having the desired contemporary feel the home design tool presents the various style categories as indicated by arrow and the user can select to view only rooms that have a desired style. In addition the user of the home design tool could also select to limit the search results to rooms having particular type tags as indicated by arrow or product tags as indicated by arrow included as part of the design. The type tags as indicated by arrow provide categories of designs that are sorted based on the type of room. The product tags as indicated by arrow provide categories of designs that are sorted based on particular products. For example if the user has selected a type of cabinets they would like to use in their design then they can search for only rooms that include that type of cabinets.

After the user has entered search specifications to search for rooms based on the entered information the home design tool presents the search results in a list of search results . The list of search results can be displayed in an order of relevance. For example the home design tool can rank each of the search results using a relevancy score that is based on the filtering characteristics entered by the user. The designs can be displayed in the search results list based on the relevancy score. For example designs that have the highest relevancy score e.g. the designs that most closely match the entered characteristics can then be presented at the top of the search results list so that the user can view the most relevant results first. In the exemplary search and search results shown in FI search results shown in the search parameters entered by the user has resulted in 5 213 potentially matching room designs. The designs have been sorted for relevance based on the preferences entered by the user and the ten designs that have the highest relevancy score have been displayed on the user interface note only 4 of the 10 are shown in . The user can view additional results by selecting a button to navigate to the next set of results ranked in terms of relevance e.g. the results ranked to .

The search results can be displayed to include various information about the room design. For example as shown in the search results can be displayed to include information that is believed to be beneficial to the user in determining whether to view the design. For example the search results can include a CAD model of the room a short description of the design and pictures of home design products used in the room. The search results can also be displayed to show the style size and dimensions of the room.

Referring back to after the home design tool receives information about the floor plan and extracts the floor plan characteristics the home design tool receives information about the room type from the user . By providing the room type the search results can be limited to the same type of room e.g. kitchen living room bedroom study play room dining room etc. . The home design tool searches for rooms having the same room type and similar floor plan characteristics . The user may also type words such as room names architectural styles room characteristics and any other term that may help refine the search into the search field to find designs of interest. The system uses taxonomy based categories and folksonomy based tags to identify matches. The system also presents the user with a list of categories and tags to further refine the search. This search can be a vector based search in which the system identifying similar designs as outlined above. The input could also be raster graphics from a user scanned and imported sketch of their design. After generating a list of related room designs based on the search algorithm the home design tool presents the search results to the user .

In some implementations a user may input a floor plan that includes multiple rooms into the home design tool and subsequently desire to make changes to a particular one of the rooms. In order to make changes to one of the rooms in the floor plan it can be beneficial to have the room be able to exist as a reference to an overall floor plan. As a referenced room that may be able to be viewed separately from the other rooms in the floor plan the user can view edit and share the room using the home design tool. The user can also use the home design tool to search for other rooms having similar layouts.

After the user has referenced or separated one room from the other adjoining rooms in a floor plan the user can edit or change the floor plan for the newly non adjoined room. The user may edit anything within the room while viewing the room independently except the walls that define boundary of the room and windows doors and wall openings included in these walls. Walls windows doors and door openings may be added within the room during this view mode. After completing the edits the user may return to view the entire floor plan and the edits appear within this view as well.

It is believed that referencing and or separating a floor plan into individual rooms can provide various advantages. For example by dividing floor plans into rooms within the database included in the home design tool not only the entire floor plan but now every room generated by each user can be easily explored searched on viewed edited and incorporated into other designs. This allows other users to drag an entire room form another user into their floor plans as a starting point for their own designs. As soon as the user makes any edits to the room design that they incorporated into her design the system breaks the reference to the original design. In other implementations the system will break the reference as soon as a user drags another user s room design into his her floor plan. However users may be able to select a hyperlink back to the original design to view the original design.

In some implementations a user may desire to combine multiple different rooms from different users or from different floor plans to generate a floor plan that includes multiple adjoined rooms. In order to combine multiple rooms into a unified floor plan the home design tool includes a system that allows a user to snap together rooms that were submitted from two distinct users or from the same user and from two distinct floor plans. A user that already has a room design in the floor plan drawing area can drag a new room into her design. The walls that are parallel to each other will merge and the system will prompt the user to choose which wall openings they wish to delete. Until two rooms are merged the user can select and move an entire room by clicking on the floor and moving it. For example as shown in a user might desire to combine a dining room with a kitchen . In order to join the two rooms e.g. the dining room with kitchen the home design tool must determine which walls need to be merged ad and how to merge the walls. For example the dining room includes a door between the portions and of one of the walls but the kitchen does not include a door on the wall that is to be joined with the wall of the dining room . As such the home design tool determines whether to keep the door when merging the two walls e.g. as shown in .

The home design tool determines whether either of the walls that are to be merged when joining the rooms does not have any wall objects such as windows doors or other openings . If one of the walls does not have any wall objects the system determines that the other wall e.g. the wall with wall objects should be given priority when merging the two walls. Since the wall with wall objects if any is given priority the home design tool merges the walls by adding any wall objects if any from the wall with wall objects to the wall without wall objects . On the other hand the home design tool determines that both of the walls have wall objects the home design tool presents a wall preference question to the user . In response to the wall preference question the home design tool receives a user selection of a wall to be given preference in the wall merging process when joining the two rooms . Once the wall merging preference is known the home design tool merges the walls by giving priority to the selected wall such that wall objects such as doors and windows on the non selected wall are removed and any wall objects from the selected wall become part of the merged wall in the joined rooms .

While in the implementation described above when both walls from two rooms to be joined include wall objects the user selects the wall to be given priority however other selection methods are possible. For example the home design tool could assign priority to the room that remains stationary or to the room that was inserted into the floor plan first.

If the walls of the joining walls are different lengths the system identifies how the user drags the room next to the other room to determine the merging process. For example if the corner vertex of the wall from the new room and the wall from the existing room are within two inches of each other and the walls are parallel to each other the system will automatically assume the user intended to merge the two corners of the wall and position the new room accordingly without adjusting its size. If the vertices are not within two inches of each other the system will simply assume that the user wishes to merge the walls and not the vertices. When the user first drags a new room towards another room they hold the left mouse button down. If they hover a wall from the room they are moving over the wall of a room they wish merge with the system will allow the user to slide the new room along the wall of the existing room. When the left mouse button is released the room position is set. Dimensions may appear during this process to show the offset from the corner of the wall for one room to the corner of the wall for another room. The user can use these dimensions to set the room position. If the user is within two inches of the vertex of the existing room s wall the new room will slide into place to merge the vertices. A possible feature is to automatically adjust a wall length to of one of the joining walls when the merge occurs. However this is not one of the most common approaches.

While in the implementations described above one wall was given priority over another wall when two walls are merged to join rooms in a floor plan however other merging processes are possible. For example a user could select particular wall objects from one or both of the walls to remain in the joined wall. In another implementation the home design tool could give preference to different types of wall objects and merge the walls according to an assigned preference. For example the home design tool could give priority to doors over windows or existing room over a new room. Other priorities will be set by which types of objects are included in the design. For example a kitchen design may be given priority over a living room design if the kitchen has objects like wall cabinets included on the merged wall of the design and the living room design has door opening in the same location.

In an implementation search results or suggestions may be generated and presented to a user. The results presented to a user may include for example various types of design layouts design elements product images visual bookmarks of products or sets or groups of these. In an implementation a process for generating and presenting search results or suggestions to a user may include building the results selecting the results or presenting the results according to a particular priority or ordering scheme or any combination of building selecting and presenting. Results may also be generated and presented to a user independently of a search. Particular search results or suggestions presented to a user may include built results or suggestions together with selected results or suggestions. Any numbers used with regard to for example building selecting and presenting are intended to serve as non limiting examples and other numbers may be used.

In an implementation results or suggestions such as layouts product images or elements or sets of these may be built according to or based on any of a variety of criteria or methodologies such as design rules adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections keyword associations input received from a user sponsorship by an advertiser or system partner or elements or images previously existing in or previously selected by a user for a layout or set of layouts or a set of product images or sets of product images . Results may also be built using subsets or minisets of layouts product images or elements. These criteria are not exhaustive and other suitable criteria for selection may be used.

In an implementation results or suggestions such as layouts product images or elements or sets of these may be selected from pre existing or simultaneously built designs including layouts product images or elements or sets of these that may have already been built by the system used built or saved by a user or users or used built or saved by or for sponsors of products elements or layouts within the designs or as combinations of these. The results may be selected by drawing from pre existing designs or by matching up to pre existing designs. The selection of results or suggestions may include selection of results built simultaneously with the selection. The results may be selected based on any of a variety of criteria or methodologies such as design rules level of compliance with design rules sponsorship by an advertiser or a system partner keyword associations input received from a user popularity of pre existing designs degree of use of pre existing designs how recently a pre existing design was used built or saved adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections architecture interior design or other design professional associations or elements or images previously existing in or previously selected by a user for a layout or set of layouts or a set of product images or sets of product images . Results may also selected by drawing from or matching up to pre existing subsets or minisets of layouts product images or elements. These criteria are not exhaustive and other suitable criteria for selection may be used.

In an implementation results or suggestions such as layouts product images or elements or sets of these may be presented according to a particular priority or ordering scheme. The results may be presented in order of any of a variety of criteria or methodologies including popularity degree of use how recently used or elements or images previously existing in or previously selected by a user for a layout or set of layouts or a set of product images or sets of product images for example. In an implementation results built by the system may be presented according to any of the criteria used in building the results and results selected by the system may be presented according to any of the criteria used in selecting the results.

In an implementation design rules may include interior or architectural design guidelines recommendations standards norms methodologies philosophies or styles individually or in combination implemented as design rules in for example algorithms of the system. The design rules may be updated from time to time to reflect changes or advancements in for example interior and architectural styles. While algorithms may be based on design rules in some implementations the design rules may be guidelines or considerations rather than strict rules.

Search results or suggestions may be filtered to avoid or reduce redundancy prior to or in conjunction with presentation to a user. In an implementation redundant individual results may be moved from groups of results prior to or in conjunction with presentation to a user. For example a first group of results may be selected for presentation to a user. In an implementation prior to or in conjunction with presentation to a user any redundant results from the first group may be removed from the first group and removed altogether. In another implementation prior to or in conjunction with presentation to a user any redundant results from the first group may be removed from the first group and placed into a second or another group of results. Other results may be brought into the first group to replace any removed redundant results so that the first group ultimately presented to a user contains the same number of results before and after removal of the redundant results. Other techniques that may avoid or reduce redundancy in search results or suggestions made to a user may be used.

Although several examples are shown using a kitchen and associated layouts elements and products many other room type driven layouts and designs are possible including for room types such as dining rooms bathrooms living rooms family rooms entertainment rooms dens and bedrooms for example. The systems and methods described may be applied to these other room types and associated layouts elements and products.

The term set of products or combination of products may be used interchangeably with the form in which the products are presented such as set of product images. Likewise the term product may generally be used as shorthand for a home design product or a landscape design product. Generally a product image may be associated with a corresponding 2D drawing or a 3D model of the product showing in the image or both. The product image may have associated tags for the product shown in the image. The tags may include certain key or core characteristics for that particular product such as sizing information. The characteristics may have been scraped from a manufacturer s website either automatically or in response to a request made by a user of the system. The product sets or product images shown may be integrated directly with a retailer s catalog of products for example so that the content and core characteristics may be provided directly from the external retailer s website.

Although search dialogue boxes or text boxes may not be illustrated on each webpage of the home design tool in an implementation the user is provided with the opportunity to refine the searching at any point or at least at numerous points of the design process.

In a user may search for designs from other users for example and may refine her design search in several ways. First the user may refine the room type as e.g. a Kitchen at box . A user may also sketch a structural design layout of a room in a sketchpad and define the shape and features of the room by using structural elements such as a window or a door opening . In an implementation a sketch drawn and entered by the user may be used to drive search results and suggestions of collected designs being presented to the user.

In and a user may also drag and drop home design product images such as an image of a stove in from search results into a refine search box . Once a product or products is moved into the refine search box search results may be returned that include results with the product or products included. All of the products returned in various product sets may or may not be an exact match of the product or products moved into the refine search box although in this instance the sets in the search results shown in all include the stove . Products sharing similar characteristics with the product or products may be included in the search results for example an oven that is stainless steel like the stove .

As shown in a user may enter search terms into a text box near the top of the webpage and may select Search Designs. In the example shown in the user entered Sun filled kitchen ge refrigerator and received 10 253 design matches with the first say twenty collected designs being shown to the user. The system may separate words or combine words and may compare the received words to a database of design keywords. The word kitchen may tell the system that the user wants the room type to be a kitchen. Sun filled may indicate two things. First it may cause the system to search for structural elements such as windows or doors that have glass in them or door openings that open into another room and thus will allow a lot of light into the room. Second Sun filled might also indicate to the system that the user wants lighter colors in the design. The system may recognize the word ge as indicating a brand of products and may assign those products a higher priority in returned search results. The word combination ge refrigerator would indicate a specific type of product and a specific brand that may likewise be assigned a higher priority in returned search results.

Generally keywords may help the system better target search results and suggestions to the user. The system may examine entered words for keywords indicating for example 1 the structure of a room or the type of room e.g. kitchen 2 types of product layouts for a room e.g. u shaped kitchen cabinets or l shaped kitchen cabinets or kitchen cabinets with an island 3 sets or combination of products e.g. sun filled may indicate a lighter colored kitchen or brighter room 4 individual products within the design e.g. refrigerator and 5 a match with descriptive text and associated tags about the actual design.

Tags associated with product images or products or with a design may include any information to help identify the product such as dimensional color and other information that may have been scraped from the product manufacturer s website or provided by the manufacturer as well as user or defined tags that describe the product or that describe a user s design. User defined tags may be assigned higher priority within the system for search results.

As shown in the search results returned to a user may include product layouts 3D design layouts and sets of product images as part of separate collected designs . The system search engine may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful results to the user. The search results include collected designs from particular users of the system however in other implementations the design search interface may dynamically build design results or suggestions for presentation to a user rather than drawing on pre existing designs. shows a first design by an interior design student Jane Doe who has provided a description of her design Traditional kitchen design offering sunlight thus returned as a result to the text search Sun filled kitchen ge refrigerator . A second design is authored by Bob Smith a contractor who likewise provided a design description for his collected design that also clearly relates to the search terms entered by the user.

As described above the system may rank designs according to any number of factors. In an implementation the system takes into account the profession or occupation of a users when selecting from pre existing user designs and prioritizing them for presentation to a user. In an implementation there may be a hierarchy of professions. An architect may be ranked ahead of an interior designer for some situations and vice versa. A contractor may in turn be ranked below both an interior designer and an architect and an interior design student may be ranked below all three for purposes of selecting and prioritization of results for example.

In an implementation searches from the design search interface may be ranked or ordered according to popularity Most Popular or how recently used Most Recent . A conflict in popularity for example two potential results having the same popularity may be resolved by resort to the criteria of the profession of the designer in the professional hierarchy that may be programmed into the system.

Users may also use the design search interface shown in or the product set search interface in to bypass various steps in the system. For example a user could select a certain set of products such as set of products in or a set of products in by selecting an option to use the set of products to create a design. A design wizard may be automatically launched that may prompt the user to choose a room layout in which to create her design. In this way a user may move more quickly to a 3D design layout that includes the selected product set or the product set

A user may also for example use the design search interface to bypass the structural design and product layout portions of the system. A user may select the product layout by selecting an option to use the product layout to create a design. A design wizard may be automatically launched that may prompt the user to choose from an array of sets of products to insert into the product layout to create more quickly a 3D design layout based on the product layout

Referring again to the product set search interface may illustrate some product set search capabilities of the home design tool. Product set searches may occur in a variety of ways. In an implementation product set search results may be returned that display product content from 3D designs that other users saved in the system. These pre existing entire product sets may show all of the products that a user used in a particular 3D design layout. For example for product set or set of product images a user may have saved a 3D design layout that included a refrigerator a light fixture a sink a stove a kitchen cabinet face and various flooring or wall colors and textures all shown in product set

In an implementation the system may dynamically build product sets from individual products or minisets of products based on for example products either selected by a user in a previous screen or product s that were dragged and dropped by a user into the refine search box .

Minisets of products generally may be combinations of one or more products that are grouped together by the system users of the system or advertisers or partner external sites. The minisets will generally be smaller than an entire set of products and may be used by the system to dynamically build an entire set of products or a larger miniset of products that includes the miniset or to influence the building of another miniset or entire set of products. An entire set of products may be generally a set of products that fully defines a 3D design layout for a particular room or simply a larger set of products that either more fully defines a 3D design layout than the minisets used to build the set or that is simply larger than the minisets.

In product set search results or suggestions may be presented to a user in order of for example popularity Most Popular or how recently used Most Recent . For example six people may have used the product set in their 3D design layouts making that product set the most popular for this particular search. The system search engine for product set search may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful product set search results or suggestions to the user. The webpage shows a text box where a user may enter text based search terms here Kitchen design with GE refrigerator and the refine search box where a user may drag and drop products or sets of products to refine search results. The user would select Search Products Sets for a text based search and the words entered would be analyzed in similar fashion to that described with reference to in this case yielding Kitchen product sets with ge refrigerators for example.

The system in addition to using descriptive keywords that may have been used by a user to describe her designs and thus the product sets associated with her designs to aid users in product set searches may also consider how such descriptive keywords correlate with selections of the product sets by other users in the system. For example the user may also have been prompted to assign descriptive keywords to a 3D design layout that included the products that make up the product set such as for style Contemporary or Modern or Traditional or Historic and one or more of these descriptive terms may have been applied to the product set. Over time if these product sets are selected by users who seek that type of design style for example the system may learn that the product set is truly Traditional or the like.

As described above in a user may also drag and drop home design product images such as an image of a stove from search results into a refine search box . Once a product or products e.g. minisets of products is moved into the refine search box search results may be returned that include results with the product or products included. All of the products returned in various product sets may or may not be an exact match of the product or products moved into the refine search box although in this instance the sets in the search results shown in all include the stove . Products sharing similar characteristics with the product or products such as similar finish options similar look or similar colors may be included in the search results for example an oven that is stainless steel like the stove .

In an implementation these returned product sets may include product sets saved by other users but product sets may also be dynamically built from the products moved into the refine search box . If a user for example drags and drops a range such as range a refrigerator and possibly a dishwasher themselves all from different product minisets into the refine search box these products may all be stainless steel and may be from certain brand name manufacturers. However the user by this combination has not given the system much information as to her design tastes or inclinations. If the user drag a kitchen cabinet face into the refine search box then the system begins to learn more information about this user s design interests because such a selection may be more specifically correlated to for example what kind of style flooring countertops paint color for windows for doors that the user may want to select. Thus minisets of products may allow the system to refine with product sets and dynamically built product sets that may be more tailored to the user s interests than pre existing sets of products stored by the system. Because the user in the example above chose an instance of a kitchen cabinet or chose a cabinet and a flooring option the system may intelligently examine the designs of other users and the product combinations used by these users in minisets to define what other products might make sense in an overall product set product sets that the system may correlate should work well together.

The right hand side of the webpage of shows a product set offered by a sponsor or advertiser. A picture or 3D layout not shown of an example kitchen that incorporates the sponsor s product set is also shown. A sponsor may want to offer an individual product as part of an entire set of products miniset of products or even an entire set of products. Advertisers may bid on minisets of products. For example an advertiser may bid on a combination of a refrigerator a stove and a dishwasher. The advertisers may bid against one another for minisets on a cost per click basis. Advertisers may bid on items such as keywords e.g. ge refrigerator product sets or minisets or individual product types to meet their particular sales objectives. In the product set for example the sponsor might have been the highest bidder for the stove .

As described above the product images making up a set of products may have associated tags for the product shown in the image. The tags may include certain key or core characteristics for that particular product such as sizing information. The characteristics may have been scraped from a manufacturer s website either automatically or in response to a request made by a user of the system. In an implementation the product sets or product images shown may be integrated directly with a retailer s catalog of products using XML Extensible Markup Language for example so that the content and core characteristics may be provided directly from the external retailer s website. In an implementation a product set search interface similar to that shown on the webpage may also be part of an external partner s website interface possibly as part of a larger design tool with for example the system s engine operating in the background so that a user may see only the external partner s interface. In an implementation integrating the system product set search capabilities alone or as part of an overarching design tool with a partner s retail catalog of products may allow the system to provide the partner with data about things such as product sets product combinations or design layouts from users of the integrated product search system. For example the system may gather information about how users combine products and choose to apply those products to design layouts that may be valuable to external partners.

In implementations of the design process shown in at various stages the system search engine may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful results to the user. The search results or suggestions may include layouts elements or products from particular users of the system however in other implementations the design search interface may dynamically build design results or suggestions based on for example design rules for presentation to a user rather than drawing on pre existing designs. A variety of criteria may be considered in building selecting or presenting results or suggestions in a particular order.

In an implementation the system may employ algorithms that may be performed in response to search terms entered that may cause the system to target search results and suggestions to the user throughout several steps of a design process. That is a user who enters very specific design search terms may be taken toward a final design in several steps rather than be provided with a very specific set of layouts or product sets to choose from. In an implementation the entered search terms may define what happens at various stages of the design process not just immediately.

For example if in the design goals the user had used the word beachhouse the home design tool may not necessarily present the user with only beachhouses. Rather the user may still be prompted to define structures such as rooms but if the design progressed to a stage at which the user defined a house e.g. in an exterior model the entered words including beachhouse may guide the user and the search results and suggestions presented to the user in that direction. That is the choices that would be suggested to a user may be guided by the words that the user initially entered several pages back in Design Goals. 

In beginning the Step Choose a Layout Option portion of an implementation of a design process a set of kitchen product layouts and a set of bathroom layouts may be presented to the user. The user may choose which room to focus on by selecting either of these options and here may select Kitchen Layouts sending the user to the webpage in .

In a screenshot of the webpage shows a product layout search interface portion of an implementation of the design process for where the user may search for and select from sets of 2D drawings of product layouts.

From the selection made on the previous screen the room type is Kitchen at box . The user may have several options at the webpage . A user may sketch a structural design layout of a room in a sketchpad and may define the shape and features of the room by using structural elements such as a window or a door opening . In an implementation a sketch drawn and entered by the user may be used to drive search results and suggestions of 2D drawings of product layouts being presented to the user. In an implementation if a user sketches a structural design layout the system will return the most popular product design layouts that have designs that match or are very similar to the requirements of the structural design layout . The system may draw on preexisting user or sponsor product layouts or may dynamically build product layouts that meet or come close to meeting the structural design layout requirements made by the user in the sketch . The user may using the sliding scales corresponding to Shape Outside Dimensions and Structural Elements affect the search results by defining the relative importance of the three criteria shape outside dimensions and structural elements. For example while the search algorithm may emphasize the shape of the room above the other criteria by moving the Structural Elements scale to the user may cause the system to provide search results that match or come close to matching the structural elements within the sketch structural design layout . In an implementation by default the system may return a group of the most popular results that match or are close to matching the sketch but may also present the results in order of the most recently used. The system may also present sponsored product layouts that match or come close to matching the sketched layout. In an implementation the system may have the capability to dynamically change product layouts sponsored or user designs to reflect dimensional changes made by the user to the room in the sketchpad .

If a user does not use the sketchpad the Most Important Aspects search criteria may be grayed out and the user may be presented with a group of product layouts . In an implementation by default the suggestions for product layouts may be drawn from the most popular product layouts and the returned group of product layouts may be ordered according to popularity. In other implementations the system may select and order product layouts based on criteria such as how recently used. Other selection criteria may be used instead of or in addition to these criteria.

In an implementation product layout results or suggestions may also be dynamically built by the system to e.g. reflect user input such as that entered in the Design Goals text boxes of or to for example comply with design rules implemented in the system.

To generate the search results as shown in the system search engine may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful product layout results to the user. Specifically search results or suggestions may be filtered to avoid or reduce redundancy prior to or in conjunction with presentation to a user. In an implementation redundant product layouts may be moved from groups of results prior to presentation to a user. For example a first group of say twenty product layouts results may be selected for presentation to a user based on popularity. In an implementation prior to presentation to a user any redundant product layout results e.g. the less popular redundant results from the first group may be removed from the first group of twenty and removed altogether. In another implementation prior to presentation to a user any redundant results e.g. the less popular redundant results from the first group of twenty may be removed from the first group and placed into a second or another group of results. Other results may be brought in to the first group of twenty to replace any removed redundant results so that the first group ultimately presented to a user e.g. group of product layouts in contains the same number of results before and after removal of the redundant results. Other techniques that may avoid or reduce redundancy in search results or suggestions made to a user may be used.

In moving redundancies from a group of results the emphasis on what redundancies to consider may vary depending on the particular part of the design process. For product layout suggestions for example the emphasis may be more on avoiding or limiting redundancies in product layout characteristics so that a user may be presented with different design options such as differently shaped kitchen cabinet arrangements or sinks refrigerators or ranges being placed in different parts of the kitchen rather than the same basic group of designs e.g. kitchen product layouts that all have l shaped kitchen cabinet layouts. For product layout suggestions structural element redundancies may be less important. An example of this may be seen in the group of suggested product layouts and the sponsored product layout shown in . Each kitchen product layout includes a window such as window in layout in the same location while the actual product elements within the product layouts show more variation.

The user may select from product layout options such as the product layout or the sponsor product layout for example. Either path choosing a product layout from results or suggestions or a sponsor product layout may take the user to some version of a product set search webpage shown in thus beginning the Step Choose Product Set s portion of an implementation of a design process.

In an implementation if for example the user chooses the sponsor product layout the user may be presented with a choice of product sets all sold by the sponsor of the product layout . A Sponsor Product Sets box on the right may not be shown since all product sets shown on the webpage may already be sponsored by the sponsor. The product set results or suggestions may typically be product sets that have been pre defined by the sponsor but in some implementations may be dynamically built product sets of the sponsor s products based on the prior selected product layout and or may include the most popular results based on product sets from pre existing user designs that use the sponsor s product sets. The user could then select from different kitchen styles such as Traditional or Country . The product set results or suggestions may generally be based on or tied closely to the product layout that the user chose in the prior webpage .

If the user chooses one of the non sponsored product layouts such as product layout in the user may be likewise presented see with groups of product set results or suggestions in different types of kitchen styles Traditional Country . Generally based on the product layout that the user chose in the prior screen the returned product set results or suggestions may be heavily tied to the products in the chosen product layout.

In an implementation a product layout may include generic product elements e.g. refrigerator that may not be associated with a specific brand of product e.g. name brand refrigerator but that still may present restrictions on the product sets that may be presented to the user on the webpage of . For example the product set results or suggestions may each include a refrigerator or a refrigerator having dimensions that satisfy the product layout dimensions. In an implementation a product layout may include product elements that are associated with a specific brand of product name brand stove or model of a product name brand stove model and may thus present additional restrictions on the product sets that may be presented to the user on the webpage . That is the product set results or suggestions may each include the specific brand product or specific brand and model product.

Other products that are either not in or specified in the product layout may be more easily left out of the product set results or suggestions. Examples may include lighting fixtures paint colors or other surface textures or possibly a dishwasher.

Groupings of product sets presented to the user may successively be less and less tied to the prior chosen product layout and may leave out successively more products. In general however the product set results or suggestions may be closely tied to the prior chosen product layout.

A user may select one of the different kitchen styles such as Traditional or Country in . According to the example progression the user may select Traditional and be taken to the webpage shown in where Traditional kitchen product set results or suggestions may be shown to the user.

As in product set search results or suggestions shown in may be presented in order of popularity or how recently used. The system search engine for this product set search aspect of the design process may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful product set search results or suggestions to the user. Product set results or suggestions created by using the refine search box may be drawn from existing product sets based on user designs or may cause new product sets to be dynamically generated. The product images making up a set of products may have associated tags for products shown in the images. The tags may include key characteristics that may have been obtained through a variety of ways as describe herein such as automatic scraping from the product manufacturer s website through integration with an external partner s website as discussed with reference to .

The design interface of includes the 3D design layout and on the right hand side of the screen an interactive design palette area . In an implementation the 3D design layout may use grayscale or another shade to indicate products that have not been filled in on the 3D design layout . That is for example the product set applied to the product layout may not have included all of the products that may be needed to match all of the product elements in the product layout . Or for example products such as paint colors for the trim or the walls or flooring options such as tile or wood were not included as part of the product set and thus do not appear in the 3D design layout .

In an implementation the system via the interactive palette area may allow the user to select things in the 3D design layout that are shaded in grayscale for example and as such may need to be defined or otherwise drag or drop product such as finishes from the interactive palette area onto the objects that may need to be defined. In an implementation the system may suggest complementary products to the user by tailoring search results or suggestions based on the context of the products already included in the 3D design layout .

In an implementation the system may also allow the user to select products that have already been filled in on the 3D design layout such as the sink and to get suggestions for other sink products that might also be used in the room.

The system may provide an interactive shopping environment for users using the interactive palette area by utilizing search algorithms that 1 may draw individual products or minisets of products from for example products already used in the pre existing designs of other users or that 2 may build individual product or product miniset results or suggestions based on criteria such as design rules or adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections or products or structural elements already included in the 3D design layout or do both 1 and 2 for example.

In an implementation the system search algorithms may examine the set of products included in the 3D design layouts as individual products or as minisets and based on the product or product s being examined may compare the user s design decisions to those of other users for example to better suggest complementary products to the user. For example a user may have selected a certain type of countertops and a certain type of kitchen cabinets for her 3D design layout. The system may leverage these product combination choices to suggest complementary products based on the design choices of other users who may have made the same selections for countertops and kitchen cabinets. Thus the system may present additional product images to the user in the interactive palette area based on the 3D models or the products underlying the 3D models incorporated into the 3D design layout .

In the particular example shown in the user may be presented with flooring options because the user may have not yet selected a flooring option or because the user has decided to view flooring options to replace an existing flooring selection. The word Flooring is in larger type in the palette area to indicate that it has been selected and coordinating flooring products such as granite tile marble tile and wide pine flooring are presented as results or suggested options.

A user may select a Product Sets box on the left hand side of to reveal a dropdown set of product sets as shown in the webpage of . The Active Product Set is the set of products presently being used in the 3D design layout while the Product Set is an alternative set of products that a user may highlight to have the system automatically apply to the 3D design layout . Two other product sets the Suggested Product Set from Sponsors and the Product Sets Suggestions may also be presented to the user. In an implementations the suggested product sets may change as a user modifies the 3D design layout by for example adding removing or changing products in the design.

A 3D design layout will typically include a variety of products. In an implementation users may be prompted to save individual products minisets of products or entire sets of products depending on the full 3D design layout an aspect of the layout such as a particular design style. Users may explore design options by returning to a previously saved products set modifying or editing the sets and saving the modified sets.

In an implementation the system may not know what to do with a particular product selected by a user as part of a product set and may query the user about the product. On webpage of a user may be told that the system is unsure where a lighting fixture that was included as part of the user s chosen product set shown as product set would be located in the 3D design layout . The user may be prompted or presented with a link that the user may select to switch to a 2D product layout view mode not shown in where the user may insert the lighting fixture in the 2D product layout at a location of her choice. Other situations may cause the system to ask the user to insert a product manually into the 2D layout for example if there is conflicting information that the system may not know how to handle.

In an implementation a user may use the 3D design layout to define a trim or a baseboard style color or texture for the room. Such trim or baseboard definitions may typically be used throughout an entire house so the system may be configured to retain the trim or baseboard definitions and to automatically apply them to any rooms that the user may have associated or may subsequently associate with the 3D design layout . Similarly certain colors or textures used in one room may typically complement colors or textures used in another typically adjoining room in a house so that in an implementation the system may be configured to retain colors or textures used in one room and to suggest or even automatically apply complementary colors and textures for any rooms that the user may have associated or may subsequently associate with the 3D design layout .

In implementations of the design process shown in at various stages the system search engine may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful results to the user. The search results or suggestions may include layouts elements or products from particular users of the system however in other implementations the design search interface may dynamically build design results or suggestions based on for example design rules for presentation to a user rather than drawing on pre existing designs. A variety of criteria may be considered in building selecting or presenting results or suggestions in a particular order.

In an implementation the design process shown in may assist a user in learning about the overall system design interface and about different features options and capabilities of the home design tool so that a user may be better prepared to work in a 3D design layout related tool and to select from e.g. presented suggestions of complementary products to apply to a 3D design layout.

According to the example progression of the design process shown in a user may begin at Step Define the Structure on webpage of by adding a room to form a structural design layout of in this instance a kitchen. A user may drag and drop a rectangle shaped room from a set of structural elements here different shaped rooms . The user may be prompted to name the room and may be for example prompted to enter room dimensions. The user may also click in and type in dimensional values. The system may automatically resize the 2D drawing or structural design layout according to the dimension. The user may choose to Add another Room which moves the user to the webpage of where a user may drag and drop a rectangle shaped room from the set of structural elements here different shaped rooms to form a structural design layout that may include both a kitchen and a dining room . The system may automatically merge the 2D drawing of the new dining room with the existing 2D drawing of the kitchen. As for the kitchen the user may be prompted to enter dimensions or click and type dimensions onto the 2D drawing. The user may add another room or proceed to the Next Step .

The user may draw from additional sets of structural elements such as windows doors or door openings fireplaces sets of stairs and closets or pantries . The structural elements shown in these may be dragged and dropped onto and automatically inserted into the various structural design layouts shown in the and users may add or be prompted to add dimensions for these structural elements when these elements are dragged and dropped or thereafter. In other implementations a variety of structural elements may be available for selection on fewer webpages or a single webpage. The sets of structural elements may be presented as results or suggestions to the user based on any of a variety of criteria such as design rules the design of other users adaptive learning based on neural network analysis of the design decisions of other users and the like. The criteria may also include for example dimensions of the structural design layout of the rooms such as kitchen and dining room or the structural elements already selected by the user for the design. As more structural elements are added the results or suggestions may be dynamically refined to reflect the modified structural design layout.

In doors or door openings may be structurally more important than windows and may be added to the structural design layouts prior to windows. The set of windows of may include different styles of windows such as casement or double hung as well as different types of windows e.g. bow window bay window standard window . In when a user drags and drops a fireplace from the set of fireplaces onto the structural design layout if the back of the fireplace extends outside of the structural design layout the user may be prompted to inform the system whether system whether she wants the exterior siding of the structure to extend around the fireplace or chimney or whether she wants exposed brick on the exterior of the building. In other implementations the user may be prompted to decide what to do with fireplaces that extend outside in an exterior 3D structural design layout mode. In the user may choose not to add stairs and continue to where set of closets and pantries may be suggested to the user. In some implementations closets and pantries may be considered structural elements while in other implementations these may be inserted automatically into product design layouts as product elements.

At the user may choose to Add another Floor Level . In an implementation if this option is selected the structural design sketchpad may show the user a tracing layer where the user may be permitted to fit a second level room or set of rooms to all or a portion of the outside perimeter of the initial floor. If the additional floor level is a second or higher floor the user may still be allowed to use dimensions that extend over the perimeter of the lower floor s such as in e.g. a split level home where second story walls may extend out beyond the first floor walls. In other implementations the system may by default provide a floorplan matching the lower or higher existing level s and permit the user to edit the structural design layout s for that floor.

In the user may choose not to add another floor level and may instead go to the next step which is an exterior 3D structural design layout view as shown on website of . In an implementation the design process continues from defining a structure using 2D drawings and layouts somewhat from an interior perspective to defining the look and feel of the exterior of the structural design layout that was built and modified in 2D mode. In an implementation the exterior 3D structural design layout view may provide a 3D modeling system that builds or selects search results and suggestions based on a criteria such as design rules including architectural design rules or adaptive learning based on neural network analysis of user design choices or both. In an implementation the system may also draw on pre existing user designs.

As shown in the system may build an exterior 3D structural design layout that is based on the 2D structural design layout including a kitchen and a dining room shown in . As shown in the new exterior 3D structural design layout includes a door and a chimney in the appropriate locations based on the prior 2D drawing from . In an implementation the system may prompt the user to define a roof to apply to the structure such as a standard gable end roof not shown or a hip roof . In an implementation the system may automatically apply a roof such as roof to a 3D layout of the two room structure constructed based on the layout to build the exterior 3D structural design layout . Although in the structure e.g. a home only has two rooms and one floor any number of rooms and floors are possible.

In an implementation the focus of the exterior 3D structural design layout view may be not only on presenting exterior structural elements but also may be on exterior structural elements that may not ordinarily be capable of being rendered in 2D drawings of layouts.

As described above the system may present the user with results or suggestions based on for example design rules and neural network analysis of user design choices such as Suggested Entries . The system may suggest various entry styles such as entry based on for example the roof type previously selected by the user on design goals or search terms e.g. architectural or interior design information desired styles etc. entered by the user on this page or previous screens.

According to the example progression of the design process the user may choose the entry to apply the entry to apply to the exterior 3D structural design layout . The entry may then appear as the entry in where on webpage the user is provided with Suggested Alterations . A first alteration to the exterior structure includes windows located on either side of the chimney a second alteration includes four windows and third alteration includes two windows and a doorway with a deck outside of the kitchen. The suggested alterations such as exterior design styles may be based on for example design rules neural network analysis of user design choices or the designs of other users and the like. For example architectural standards or guidelines implemented as design rules might recommend a window on each side of a fireplace.

In the user may choose finishes for the exterior of the structure and may be provided with Suggested Textures such red bricks for say a traditional style home or gray shingles for say a New England style beachhouse .

The system may suggest more complex exterior structural changes to be made to the exterior 3D structural design layout depending on for example choices made by the user. For example the user might have been asked what style of home she wanted and respond responded that she wanted a beachhouse and thus may have received results or suggestions throughout the design process that tend subtly or more pointedly in the direction of a beachhouse but choices made by the user during the design process might suggest a different structure architectural style or exterior design altogether such as a traditional Colonial and the system may be configured to readjust results or suggestions that may be presented to the user according to subtle shifts in user choices.

According to the example progression of the design process the user selects Next Step to move to the webpage of where the user may begin Step Choose Product Layouts. If the user made any changes in the exterior 3D structural design layout view that would cause the dimensions of the 2D structural design to change then the user may be prompted before proceeding to choose product layouts to confirm that the changes should be applied to the 2D structural design layout or to any previously defined product layout . The user may also be presented with an Aerial View of the 2D structural design layout that includes the kitchen and the dining room so that the user may Select a Room to Finish the Design . According to the example progression of the design process the user may select the kitchen and in the aerial view disappears showing a structural design layout of the kitchen. In an implementation the system may direct the user to cycle through each room in the house in this instance beginning with the kitchen and then when that design is complete for example when one or more product layouts are selected or when a 3D design layout is completed the user may be directed to choose another room here the dining room is the only other room defined in the structure .

In a screenshot of the webpage shows a product layout interface where the system may suggest a set of product layouts to the user to apply to the structural design layout of the kitchen. In contrast to for example the product layout search interface shown in in the dimensions of the structural room layout coupled with the likelihood that the layout is merged with one or more other rooms here only a dining room see may place more limitations on the type of product layout searches that may be performed. For example searches of pre existing user designs may prove limited since any matching product layout may need to have matching structural elements in the same locations as well as to have either the same dimensions or be scalable to the same dimensions as the structural design layout . Therefore in an implementation the system may dynamically build a set of product layouts that match the defined structural design layout based on for example design rules such as interior design guidelines or standards implemented as design rules or neural network analysis of the design choices of other users. In an implementation the product layouts may typically be built automatically by the system rather than manually by a user. There may be any number of scenarios under which the system may dynamically build product layouts such as when the system provides product layout results or suggestions that match or may be scaled to match an existing structural design layout. Another example scenario may occur when a user has made changes to the exterior structure then the system may in some implementations conditioned on confirmation from the user dynamically build a new product layout based on the changes or may provide additional matching product layout results or suggestions to the user.

As shown in the structural design layout includes a closet as a structural element. A parallel structural design layout shown in might not include a closet as a structural element. In an implementation closets may be treated as structural elements and added to structural design layouts prior to the product layout process. In an implementation closets may be treated as product elements and may be added by the system during the product layout process for example before along with of after other product elements are inserted into the structural design layout to build a product layout. According to some design philosophies that may be implemented by the system as design rules closets or other storage areas may be considered less structural than for example a window or a door because storage size may be more dependent on everything else that goes into a room. According to other design philosophies that may be implemented by the system as design rules closets may be considered more structural such in the case of a bedroom or a pre existing structure that already has built in closets.

According to a first example procedure product elements such as a sink a stove and a refrigerator may be inserted into the structural design layout which includes the closet in conformance with any structural elements already in the structural design layout to form an intermediate product layout . Similarly product elements such as the sink the stove and the refrigerator may be inserted into the structural design layout along with a closet that may be identical to the closet .

In an implementation architectural or interior design guidelines that may be implemented as design rules by the system may direct or guide the insertion of the product elements into the structural design layouts . Some examples of design industry guidelines or standards that may be applied to a kitchen may include the following 

 2 core product elements such as a sink a refrigerator and a stove may be most advantageously positioned in a kitchen to form a work triangle of the products sized so that for example the products may be located near to one another and a person using the products may walk to all three easily.

In an implementation once product elements such as core product elements have been inserted into a structural design layout the system may insert additional product elements that are more flexibly sized according to product elements and structural elements already in the room. In the case of a kitchen such additional product elements may include kitchen cabinets or an island located in the middle of a kitchen for example. The system may automatically populate such additional product elements around and in conformance with structural elements and other product elements already in the room based on criteria such as design rules neural network analysis of the design choices or behavior of other users of the system or pre existing user designs.

For automatic insertion and population of kitchen cabinets such as cabinets into a structural design layout such as layout or layout around and in conformance with structural elements such as windows and possibly a closet and other product elements already in the structural design layout such as a sink a stove or a refrigerator and possibly a closet the following non exhaustive examples of design industry guidelines or standards may be applied 

In an implementation the system may also automatically lay countertops across the lower level kitchen cabinets in the 2D product layout based on knowledge of where the kitchen cabinets are located.

Of course the example procedures shown in may be applied to any variety of kitchen layouts as well as to layouts for other rooms than kitchens. The following are merely examples that are not intended in any way to exhaust the possibilities for dynamically building product layouts 

For example for a bathroom core product elements may include a tub shower a sink and a toilet and these may be inserted around structural elements in a 2D structural design layout based on design guidelines that may be implemented as design rules such as that a window may not be located in a shower stall.

For example for an entertainment room core product elements may include a television. The television product element may be inserted in an ideal location based on the structural design layout. If the room includes a fireplace a structural element that may serve as another focal point for the room. In an implementation once certain product elements have been inserted into the structural design layout in conformance with any structural elements in the room product elements such as furniture may be automatically inserted into the structural design layout of the entertainment room. A set of furniture may be applied for example around the television for convenient viewing of the television or around the television and in a quieter area of the room. A structural element such as a fireplace typically already defined in the structural design layout may be a competing focal point of the room so that sets of furniture may likewise be automatically placed for convenient viewing of the fireplace. The system may determine the approximate size of furniture that may go in these locations depending on for example the overall size of the room. As with other rooms interior design styles such as a preference for contemporary or modern architecture vs. traditional architecture as shown by for example the type of home may influence the choice of furniture included in the product layout. A sectional or l shaped couch may be used for contemporary or modern style homes while a more traditional couch may be used in a product layout for a traditional home such as a Colonial style home.

For example for a dining room a product element such as a dining room table may be inserted into a structural design layout of a dining room and may be automatically located and sized according to the room dimensions. For example a long dining room table may be rotated to go along with the longer length of the room unless for example the room has equal sides or the dining room is an extremely large room. In general the system may automatically find an appropriate size for the table in the room. If the room is an extremely large room then the system may view the room in terms of a dining area and a sitting area and focus its attention on the dining area when positioning the dining room table.

For example for a bedroom the system may insert a product element such as a bed into a structural design layout of a bedroom in conformance with structural elements including doors or windows. Positioning the bed across from doors or door openings so that entry into the room typically looks toward the bed may be considered in compliance with an interior design guideline that may be implemented as a design rule. Similarly product elements such as nightstands may be placed underneath windows structural elements on each side of a bed.

As described above in an implementation design rules may include interior or architectural design guidelines recommendations standards norms methodologies philosophies or styles individually or in combination implemented as design rules in for example algorithms of the system. The design rules may be updated from time to time to reflect changes or advancements in for example interior and architectural styles. While algorithms may be based on design rules in some implementations the design rules may be guidelines or considerations rather than strict rules.

Referring once again to the product layouts dynamically built in may be presented as a part of results or suggestions to the user. According to the example progression of the design process the user may select the product layout so that product layout may be automatically applied to the structural design layout as shown on the screenshot of the webpage of . The product layout may become a first product layout option on the left hand side of the screen. The user may choose an alternative product layout which on the webpage of may become a second product layout option for the user. In general the system may allow the user to retain multiple product layouts for use in the design process.

In an implementation once a user has chosen one or more product layouts for the particular room an aerial view may be launched not shown similar to the aerial view in to prompt the user to select a new room to choose product layouts for. According to the example progression of the design process the user may decide to skip the dining room and proceed to choosing one or more product sets for the one or more product layouts as shown in the screenshots of the webpages of . The above discussions with respect to apply to including discussions of choosing product set styles and product sets and relevant aspects of the discussion of the product set search interface in may also apply to . Once one or more product sets are chosen by the user to apply to one or more product layouts the user may proceed to what may be a finalization of the design process shown in a screenshot of a webpage from . The above discussions with respect to apply to including discussions of the 3D design layout and presenting the user with complementary product suggestions.

As shown in although the multistage design process may proceed from left to right in a linear fashion a user may move from one stage to another stage as desired. For example a user may define a product layout of a room at one stage and then may cycle back if desired to a prior stage to modify an exterior 3D structural design layout. Changes made by the user at stage to the exterior 3D structural design layout such as moving a window may cause changes to an already defined product layout and in an implementation the system may prompt the user at stage to redefine a product based on the changes. In general a user may move back and forth as desired between the stages . In an implementation changes made in the various modes and stages may be automatically implemented and applied to all designs in all modes while in other implementations user may be prompted to respond to the effect that changes in one mode or stage may cause to designs in other modes or stages.

In implementations of the design process shown in at various stages the system search engine may employ redundancy avoidance or minimization techniques as described herein to present more unique and potentially more helpful results to the user. The search results or suggestions may include layouts elements or products from particular users of the system however in other implementations the design search interface may dynamically build design results or suggestions based on for example design rules for presentation to a user rather than drawing on pre existing designs. A variety of criteria may be considered in building selecting or presenting results or suggestions in a particular order.

In an implementation the design process shown in may provide a user with single screen interface with which to move back and forth between various stages of a design e.g. stages of and back and forth between 2D and 3D design and view modes. An example of the basic interface is shown in the screenshot of the webpage shown in . Two large tabs appear on the screen. A user may begin to define the interior and exterior structure of a design by clicking the first tab labeled Define the Structure Exterior while the user may begin to define the interior look and feel of a design by clicking second tab labeled Define Room Layouts Make Product Selections. 

On the part of the interface shown in the system is in 2D design mode and stage of the first tab is active and a user may drag and drop a rectangle shaped room from a set of structural elements here different shaped rooms . The user may be prompted to name the room here a Bedroom and may be for example prompted to enter room dimensions. The user may also click in and type in dimensional values. The system may automatically resize the 2D drawing or structural design layout according to the dimensions. The user may draw from additional sets of structural elements not shown such as windows door or door openings fireplaces sets of stairs and closets or pantries for example. The sets of structural elements may be presented as results or suggestions to the user based on any of a variety of criteria such as design rules the designs of other users adaptive learning based on neural network analysis of the design decisions of other users and the like. As more structural elements are added the results or suggestions may be dynamically refined to reflect the modified structural design layout. A user may add other rooms and floor levels to the design as desired.

On the part of the interface shown in the system is in 3D design mode and stage of and the first tab is active. In the system may build an exterior 3D structural design layout that is based on the 2D structural design layout shown in . As shown in the new exterior 3D structural design layout includes for example a door and windows in the appropriate locations based on the prior 2D drawing from . In an implementation the system may prompt the user to define a roof to apply to the structure or may automatically apply a roof to a 3D layout of the multi level multi room structure constructed based on the layout to build the exterior 3D structural design layout .

The structural design layout exhibits an exterior style that may include various exterior structural elements for example exterior structural elements that may not typically be capable of being rendered in 2D drawings of layouts. The system as in may present the user with results or suggestions based on for example design rules and neural network analysis of user design choices such as Suggested Exterior Styles . The system may suggest various exterior styles such as exterior style including a deck based on for example the roof type previously selected by the user on design goals or search terms e.g. architectural or interior design information desired styles etc. entered by the user on this page or previous screens of the interface.

The user may for example choose the suggested exterior style that includes the deck to apply to the exterior 3D structural design layout . The suggested exterior style may be applied to the layout and then appear in on webpage as the active exterior style on a modified layout . The previously applied exterior style may be shown as a saved option for the user to return to throughout the design process.

On the part of the interface shown in the system is in 2D design mode and stage of the second tab is active and a user may begin to define product layouts for different rooms of the structure. If for example the user made any changes in the 3D design mode to the exterior 3D structural design layout that would cause the dimension of the 2D structural design to change then the user may be prompted before proceeding to choose product layouts to confirm that the changes should be applied to the 2D structural design layout or to any product layouts that the user may have already defined for the rooms in an earlier visit to this part of the interface. For example if a product layout had already been chosen for a kitchen with a window facing out of the structure and kitchen cabinets on either side of the window if the user deleted the window in the 3D design mode and stage of e.g. then the system may for example automatically add more cabinets in place of the window and may ask the user to confirm the change. If the user had added a window to the wall of the kitchen in the exterior 3D design mode then the system may for example automatically remove kitchen cabinets to make room for the window and may ask the user to confirm the change.

The user may also be presented with an Aerial View of all or a portion of the 2D structural design layout so that the user may choose a room for which the user may define product layouts. According to the example progression of the design process the user may select the kitchen and in the aerial view disappears showing a structural design layout of the kitchen. The above discussions with respect to apply to including discussions of defining and dynamically building product layouts and choosing product layouts to apply to a structural design layout of e.g. a kitchen. After selecting one or more product layouts the user may proceed not shown to choosing one or more product sets for the one or more product layouts. The above discussions with respect to are instructive here including discussion of choosing product set styles and product sets and relevant aspects of the discussion of the product set search interface in .

Once one or more product sets are chosen by the user to apply to one or more product layouts the user may proceed to what may be a finalization of the design process shown in a screenshot of a webpage from . On the part of the interface shown in the system is in 3D design mode and stage of the second tab is active and a user may finish filling in products on the 3D design layout or cycle back to an earlier stage of the design. The above discussions with respect to apply to including discussions of the 3D design layout and presenting the user with complementary product suggestions.

In an implementation a graphical image of a home design product such as e.g. a piece of furniture an appliance or an accessory may be received and 2D and 3D representations of the home design product may be created. The 2D and 3D representations may be created or built according to or based on any of a variety of criteria or methodologies such as design rules adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections data input or feedback provided by users or partners of the system data scraped from websites of e.g. home design product manufacturers data from databases of saved standard profiles pre built 3D base models and known attributes of product types and images results of evaluating the graphical image including results from perspective determination edge detection plane detection feature and profile detection and evaluation standard solid modeling techniques and design recipes.

2D and 3D representations of a home design product may be created or built using any of a variety of acts depending on the implementation and the acts may be performed in a different order and may be repeated. Processing used to create or build the 2D and 3D representations of the home design product based on a graphical image of the home design product may proceed in parallel. The processing used to create or build the 2D and 3D representations may be entirely or partially automated. All or part of the processing may also be manually performed responsively to input from a user.

In an implementation design rules may include interior or architectural design guidelines recommendations standards norms methodologies philosophies or styles individually or in combination implemented as design rules in for example algorithms of the system. The design rules may be updated from time to time to reflect changes or advancements in for example interior and architectural styles. While algorithms may be based on design rules in some implementations the design rules may be guidelines or considerations rather than strict rules.

A graphical image or graphical image file such as a JPEG or a GIF file that depicts e.g. a home or landscape design product may be received by the system. The home design product may be any of a variety of products for example a piece of furniture such as a chair or a couch an appliance such as a range dishwasher or refrigerator or any other furnishings appliances or accessories. The system may create or build 2D and 3D representations of the home design product depicted in the graphical image. The system may accommodate a vast variety of graphical images and may use one or more techniques to create or build the 2D and 3D representations of the home design product.

The graphical image may be a basic image received by the system for example without any content or information associated with the image. The graphical image may be a bookmarked or scraped image that is accompanied by content or information such as taxonomy or folksonomy information sizing information keywords associated with or regarding the home design product depicted in the graphical image. The graphical image may be received into the system as part of a user bookmarking a home design product from e.g. a website of a manufacturer or a retailer of the home design product as described in more detail above. An advertiser or a manufacturer may provide the graphical image of a home design product as part of placing content and information regarding the home design product into the system via e.g. a bookmarking tool as described in more detail above. The system may use a scraping technology and a taxonomy folksonomy based indexing and categorizing system to scrape websites of e.g. home design product manufacturers and retailers for content and information regarding a home design product as described in more detail above. The graphical image of the home design product may be part of content received from automatically scraping a website.

Several examples of graphical images depicting home design products are shown in . is a graphical image or picture of a range is a picture of an armchair is a picture of a kitchen stool and is a picture of a set of shelves or a shelving unit .

Once the graphical image has been received by the system the system may attempt to identify and define the product type or the product model type of the home design product depicted in the graphical image. In so doing the system may retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models that correspond to the defined or identified product model type of the home design product depicted in the graphical image.

The product model type may be identified and defined in a variety of ways. If the graphical image received by or input to the system is associated with scraped data from e.g. the website of a manufacturer or retailer of the home design product. In scraping the website the system may have obtained the type of the product for example an armchair and other words related to the specific features of the product for example. The system may know based on the scraped data the product category and subcategory and other information that the home design product depicted in the graphical image is a bathtub or more particularly a five foot long bathtub that comes in standard dimensions. The system may search a database using words or other information related to the product to automatically retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models.

The system may also prompt a user for input by for example presenting one or more pre built 3D base models to the user for the user to choose from to associate with the graphical image.

The system may also use image evaluation. The system may evaluate the image by e.g. using edge detection techniques. As part of image evaluation the system may examine past data that the system gathered related to image interpretation i.e. neural networking data. For example if the system has repeatedly found the same isometric view of an armchair the system may determine based on this neural networking data that a graphical image presently being interpreted using edge detection and feature detection is most likely say an armchair and the system may retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models of an armchair. The system may identify edges and surfaces in the graphical image such as the arm of an armchair to identify the product model type as an armchair and retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models of an armchair. The system may match edges and surfaces in the graphical image with images previously collected by the system for example. The product model type may be determined based on a feature interpreted from the graphical image that is common to a particular product model type.

The one or more pre built 3D base models retrieved by the system may be manipulated e.g. parametrically adjusted or scaled to serve as a basic or underlying structure for the 3D representation of the home design product. A 3D base model may provide baseline data for the eventual 3D representation of the home design product. For example the pre built 3D base model may provide the overall shape of an armchair. The arms may not be rounded for example as in an example graphical image of an armchair but the basic shapes and general planes of the armchair may be similar or the same. A pre built 3D base model may be used to build a 3D base model from scratch or on the fly that may in turn be used as the basic or underlying structure for the 3D representation of the home design product.

For some graphical images of home design products there may be no pre built 3D base model that corresponds to or is associated with the image and that may for example serve as the basic or underlying structure of a 3D representation of the home design product. The system may without the use of a pre built 3D base model build a 3D base model from scratch or on the fly in an automated process that may in turn be used as the basic or underlying structure for a 3D representation of the home design product.

Referring to the several examples of graphical images depicting home design products shown in the system may more easily define the product model type of the range depicted in picture of than the set of shelves depicted in picture of or even the armchair or the kitchen stool of the pictures of . Similarly the system may find one or more pre built 3D base models to associate with the range or even the armchair . An example pre built 3D base model for the range is shown in . The system may for example e.g. find no pre built 3D base model to associate with the set of shelves or for that matter the armchair . The system may then build 3D base models from scratch or on the fly in an a automated process to associate with the set of shelves or the armchair . The complexity of the shape of the image of the product may impact whether the product model type may be defined whether a pre built 3D base model may be found to associate with the home design product or whether a 3D base model may be built from scratch or on the fly in an automated process. For example furniture may present more complexity than a more box shaped appliance such as a range.

The 3D base model may be built according to a tile recipe. The file recipe may be adjusted based on any of a variety of criteria or methodologies including data and input provided by a user and adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections for example.

Assuming that no pre built 3D base model is found to associate with the graphical image for example the picture showing the armchair in or that any pre built 3D base models that are found are used in building a 3D base model to associate with the graphical image the system may first determine the perspective of the graphical image of the home design product. That is the system may determine the perspective that the picture of the home design product here the picture showing the armchair was taken in. The system may examine things in the background of the graphical image other than the home design product to determine the perspective and to obtain perspective information. The system may obtain image background information like wall and floor intersections wall and wall intersections and ceiling and wall intersections. The picture also shows the intersection of the armchair with walls and the floor . The system may also examine object data in the home design product itself. The system may draw lines along the home design product image to determine perspective such as a line from the right front leg to the right back leg of the armchair . Another line may be along the top of the armchair and still another may be from the left front leg to the right front leg of the armchair . The different lines in the drawing may create planes for a 3D base model of the armchair . The system may obtain the perspective information to determine how to match a 3D base model to the image of the armchair and to better interpret data in the image of the armchair .

The system may assign main overall dimensions to the image of the armchair such as dimensions for height width and depth of the home design product if the dimensions are available. The system may use the main overall dimensions to set a relative scale for a 3D base model of the armchair . The main overall dimensions may available from user or advertiser input or from e.g. data scraped from a website of a manufacturer or retailer. For example a retailer typically may provide raw dimensions of a home design product so that people can know whether they can e.g. fit the product into their home or in a room or space of their home and the system may obtain these dimensions as scraped data. If no dimensional information is available or to complement such information the system may infer and assign sizing or dimensional information based on information provided in the graphical image such as the known size of other objects in the scene of the graphical image or known dimensions of walls in the scene for example.

The system may also assign detailed object information including dimensional data for features of the home design product if the detailed object information is available. For example in the case of a dresser the system may have information regarding the size of the drawers or the number of drawers in the dresser. For a sink the system may have information such as the distance between the two holes for the faucets or the dimensions of the basin of the sink. On a range detailed object information may include where the control panel is located how many knobs on the control panel and the like. On an armchair such as the armchair the system may have information on the distance that the front faces of the arms are set back from the front of the armchair either absolutely or relative to the distance from the front to the back of the armchair.

The system may use edge detection techniques on the graphical image to find and assign main object planes in the CAD model that is being used to build the 3D base model. The main object planes may be top bottom left right front and back planes that may form a box. Opposing main object planes may be parallel to one another. The main object planes may together form a bounding box for the CAD model that may define the outer boundaries of the home design product as depicted in the graphical image. As such the main object planes may be used as the basis for building a 3D base model of the home design product. The system may utilize perspective information to find and assign the main object planes.

According to the example of the armchair in the picture of the outside of the arms may determine the left and right planes the front of the chair may determine the front plane the top of a top cushion may determine the top planes and the legs in combination with the distance between the left and right planes and front and back planes may determine the bottom plane for example. A bounding box for the armchair is shown in with top bottom left right front and back planes.

The system may also assign main object planes that intersect at the center of the home design product image and that are perpendicular to one another as shown in in the CAD model that is being used to build the 3D base model.

The system may resize the bounding box formed by the main object planes according to the main overall dimensions described above. The main overall dimensions may determine the distance between opposing main object planes. The bounding box may define the outer boundaries of the 3D base model within which the 3D base model may be built.

The system may next determine intermediary planes or feature level planes based on e.g. analysis of the home design product image and on accumulated knowledge of the system and may assign these feature level planes within the bounding box in the CAD model. The accumulated knowledge of the system may include for example data obtained from interpretation of the image such as edge detection data perspective information feature detection data and feature information detailed object data such as dimensional data for features of the home design product stored feature level plane information for the product model type and neural networking information.

As an example of accumulated knowledge of the system the system may know based on e.g. interpretation of the image the product model type or detailed object data such as dimensional information on an armchair such as the armchair the distance that the front faces of the arms are set back from the front of the armchair either absolutely or relative to the distance from the front to the back of the armchair. For example the system may know that the front faces of the arms of the armchair are within the bounding box of the CAD model of the total distance from the front of the bounding box to the back of the bounding box so that a feature level plane may be assigned at of the distance back from the front of the bounding box. The system may have interpreted the image using e.g. edge detection to determine that features such as the front faces of the arms were at this distance or relative distance. The system may have had prior knowledge that in armchairs or in this type of armchair a feature level plane should be placed at this distance or relative distance. shows the bounding box with a feature level plane included within the box at the relative location that the front faces of the arms are located within the image of the armchair.

The system may place numerous intermediary planes or feature level planes within the bounding box in the CAD model that is being used to build the 3D base model. Each feature level plane may correspond to one or more features that e.g. the system detected while interpreting the image or that e.g. the system knew to look for based on knowledge of the product model type. The system may also use a pre built 3D base model to know which feature level planes to use. Feature level planes may correspond to stored known feature level planes for the product model type. For example the system may know that a feature level plane exists for the front faces of the arms of an armchair see the feature level plane in that another feature level plane exists for the top of the seat cushion of the armchair see the feature level plane in and that another feature level plane exists for the right side of the base of the armchair that extends up through the right arm of the armchair see the feature level plane in . The feature level plane may be assigned to capture the front faces of the arms of the armchair the feature level plane may be assigned to capture the top of the seat cushion of the armchair and the feature level plane may be assigned to capture the right side of the base of the armchair Another feature level plane may be assigned to capture the left side of the base of the armchair. The left side of the base is not shown in the armchair image but a plane may be defined in part based on the left edge that can be seen of the front of the armchair. The plane may then be rotated until the plane is parallel to the left main object plane of the bounding box . The feature level planes shown in may be parallel to different main object planes of the bounding box but for other home design product images the feature level planes may be but need not be parallel to main object planes.

The system may recognize features in the home design product image and assign a feature level plane to capture those features. The system may assign a feature level plane to an image in a location where features would be expected to be found based on accumulated knowledge of the system.

The graphical image of the home design product may in general be a raster graphic made up of pixels. The system may examine the raster graphic or raster graphic information from the graphical image for features in the hone design product image such as the front faces of the arms of the armchair. The system may build a 2D vector drawing a profile that may correspond to a feature in the home design product image. The system may build the profile in a feature level plane. The system may build or create the profile from scratch by detecting the feature in the home design product image and approximating the feature in a 2D vector drawing. The system may retrieve a profile from a database of standard profiles that correspond to features in home design product images. The stored profiles may be parametrically adjustable by the system so that a stored profile may be automatically resized based on e.g. sizing information for the home design product image to match a detected feature on the home design product image.

The system may thus apply existing profiles for features of the home product image from the database of standard profiles to the feature level planes. The system may parametrically adjust the existing profiles to align with features detected in the home design product image. The system may build profiles for features of the home product image to the feature level planes using 2D vector drawing techniques such as drawing lines arcs curves and the like.

The system may use edge detection to find edges of features in the feature level planes that the system has assigned. Candidates for features are parts of the home design product image that intersect the feature level planes or that lie within the feature level planes.

In performing feature detection the system may choose to ignore certain edges detected in the home design product image as extraneous details and not include representations of the details in the 3D base model.

The system may create numerous profiles on numerous feature level planes. The profiles that the system may create may be identified as candidates for application of common solid modeling techniques to the profiles. Common solid modeling techniques may include extruding an object or a shape here a profile extruding a shape along a path such as a curved path revolving a shape revolving a shape along a path and other solid modeling techniques well known in the art such as warping chamfers fillets drafting angles and cuts.

The system may apply common or standard solid modeling techniques to a profile i.e. 2D vector drawing to complete a feature of the home design product image. For example the seat cushion of the armchair may be modeled in a 3D CAD model by identifying a profile in the feature level plane of and that corresponds to the shape a T shape of the top of the seat cushion. The T shaped profile may be extruded downward to form a 3D model of the seat cushion of the armchair as indicated by the arrows in the bounding box and the feature level plane are not shown in . Referring to a 3D model of the seat cushion may also be built by identifying a rectangular profile in a feature level plane that shares the same plane as the front plane of the bounding box of e.g. . The rectangular profile may be extruded toward the back of the armchair as indicated by the arrows in to form a box that serves as a bounding box for a 3D model of the seat cushion. As shown by the dashed lines in the system may then identify the portions of the box that overlap parts of the right and left arms of the armchair and may remove those portions to form a 3D model of the seat cushion of the armchair as shown in .

Use of either profile or by the system may result in an acceptable 3D model of the seat cushion but the profile may be seen as a best profile since the system may have performed fewer acts in less time to build the 3D model of the seat cushion than to build the 3D model of the seat cushion.

As described the profiles that the system may create may be identified as candidates for application of common solid modeling techniques to the profiles. The system may evaluate the best profile for application of solid modeling techniques such as extrusion or revolving. The best profile or best profiles may be selected according to any of a variety of criteria including which profile results in the least execution time by the system which profile results in the most complete feature which profile results in the most efficient use of solid modeling techniques and the like. The system may store best profile information as part of the database of standard profiles described above. The system may use best profiles or best profile information from the database to select which of the candidate profiles are the best profiles for application of common solid modeling techniques. For example best profile information may cause the system to select the profile for building a 3D model of the seat cushion of the armchair. The system may lack best profile information on one or more profiles and so may apply solid modeling techniques absent best profile information. Best may include the best way or may include a preferred or better way according to any of a variety of criteria.

The system may also determine portions of the images on the feature level planes that may be cropped for subsequent application to the 3D base model to form the 3D representation of the home design product.

If the home design product depicted in the graphical image is thought to be symmetrical or to have symmetrical features the system may mirror profiles or profile information on the feature level planes to parts of the plane where a symmetrical features intersects or is expected to intersect the feature level plane. F or example the system may recognize the armchair as having the same arms one on the left and one on the right. A profile that may define the front face of the right arm of the armchair including the portion of the front face covered by the seat cushion in the feature level plane see may be mirrored around an axis in the center of the plane to form a profile that may define the front face of the left arm of the armchair in the plane . The system may use a mirroring technique to provide profiles for symmetrical features that may not be shown or that may be partially obstructed due to the perspective in which the home design product image is set. The system may mirror profiles prior to application of solid modeling techniques to the profiles such as extrusion of a profile. The system may mirror e.g. an extruded profile to form a copy of an extruded profile with the mirroring occurring equidistant from one side of a plane to another side of the plane rather than within a plane.

The system may apply the common solid modeling techniques such as extrusion and revolving to profiles that have been evaluated and identified. The system may apply the techniques to best profiles and may use techniques that have been evaluated for those profiles. For example the system may extrude a profile such as the profile of to build the 3D model of the seat cushion of . In the case of an image of a lamp for example a profile of the lamp may be revolved around as part of building a 3D base model for the lamp. The system may apply mirroring techniques to profiles before or after applying common solid modeling techniques such as extrusion and revolving. The system may prompt a user for input regarding whether the system has interpreted the home design image correctly or acceptably to the user. For example the system may request a user to specify whether one or more profiles are appropriate for application of solid modeling techniques. The system may be fully or partially automated in building a 3D base model. The system may perform acts toward building a 3D base model to associate with the home design product image without requesting or receiving input from a user.

The system may apply other common solid modeling procedures to objects upon which some common solid modeling procedures have been performed. For example a profile may have been extruded to form a 3D model of a particular feature. The system may apply solid modeling procedures such as applying chamfers fillets drafting angles and cuts to 3D models of features of the home design products such as say the base a seat cushion or the arms of the armchair. Feature details detected via e.g. edge detection of the home design product image or accumulated knowledge of the system may inform the application of procedures such applying chamfers fillets drafting angles and cuts to and into 3D models. For example the front edge of the seat cushion may be rounded so that system may apply fillets to the front edges of the 3D model of the seat cushion to round the edges of the seat cushion. A chamfer may include a flat edge cut out of a corner a drafting angle may include an angle of a surface and a cut may include a portion cut out of the 3D model. The system may prompt a user to apply the solid modeling techniques or the process may be automated or a combination of both.

The system may apply warping techniques to warp 3D model surfaces as part of building the 3D base model. The system may warp extrusions of profiles based on feature edge detection and accumulated knowledge regarding properties of the home design product. For example the arms of a stuffed armchair may be puffy due to stuffing under the fabric making the surfaces of the arms along the length of the arms curved rather than flat. Likewise the cushions of an armchair may be stuffed and thus the surfaces of the cushions are curved or warped rather than perfectly flat. The system may warp the extrusions of profiles that formed the 3D models of the arms and the cushions of the armchair. The base of the chair may have flat surfaces and may not need warping for example.

The system may also determine an order in which to apply solid modeling techniques to profiles or e.g. extrusions of profiles and otherwise build the 3D base model to associate with the home design product image. The order of building the 3D base model may be based on for example standard industry design techniques or design rules and previous knowledge accumulated regarding efficient or useful methods of building the 3D base model for the product model type. For example the accumulated knowledge of the system may indicate that an efficient way to build the 3D base model of an armchair may be to draw or model the base of the chair then to draw the arms of the chair then to draw the back of the chair then to draw the cushions seat and back of the chair with the legs of the armchair being drawn at any point after the base is drawn. The system may also apply known solid modeling techniques such as warping surface at various points in the building of the 3D base model for example the system may warp the surfaces of the arms before the cushions. The system may prioritize features such as base of the chair before the arms of the chair and arms of the chair before cushions of the chair for example. In general the system may build the 3D base model using any order of solid modeling techniques as applied to any order of profiles features or 3D model objects.

The system may compare the resultant built 3D base model with any of a variety of things to determine whether the resultant built 3D base model properly characterizes the home design product image and may thus be associated with the home design product image and used as the basic or underlying structure for the 3D representation of the home design product. The system may compare the built 3D base model with the home design product image using e.g. edge detection techniques to data scraped from a website of a manufacturer or retailer of the home design product to one or more pre built 3D base models for e.g. the product model type such as an armchair to past data that the system gathered related to image interpretation i.e. neural networking data relating to e.g. the product model type. The system may present one or more built 3D built 3D base models to a user for the user to verify or to choose from to associate with the graphical image. A user may be prompted to choose a model that most closely approximates the home design product image and may given the option to ask the system to go back and build a new 3D base model. The system may have built several 3D base models serially or in parallel for presentation to a user or for comparison with the home design product image.

If the system determines for whatever reason that the built 3D base model does not properly characterize the home design product image the system may return to previous acts of the process for building the 3D base model and for example repeat actions until the system validates a 3D base model i.e. obtains a built 3D base model that is a closer match to the home design product image. The system may for example return to the edge or feature detection process or main object or feature level plane assignment or profile identification to find a point at which the process for building the 3D base model may have gone awry. The 3D base model comparison and validation process may be fully automated or may be partially automated interspersed with prompts to a user for example.

The system may build 3D base models of non symmetrical home design product images as well or of partially non symmetrical home design product images. The system may employ iterative best guess techniques that may leverage any of e.g. parallel processing image interpretation accumulated knowledge of the system regarding the home design product or detected features of the home design product and user input or a combination of these.

When the system compares and attempts to validate a 3D base model the system may present to a user for verification alternative 3D base models that are based on non symmetrical interpretations of the home design product image.

Once the system has built a 3D base model the system may examine the surfaces of the 3D base model and evaluate potential groupings of surfaces or subsets of surfaces for textures to be applied to. The system may evaluate the potential groupings based on any of a variety of factors such as data from pre built 3D base models image interpretation data including edge detection data from the home design product image commonly used surface groupings for the product model type scraped data user input or prior user feedback neural networking data or any combination of these. Depending on the particular 3D base model associated with the home design product image the 3D base model may be quite complex with numerous surfaces for textures to be applied to. For example for the armchair shown in the graphical image of the built 3D base model may have numerous surfaces with flat edges and the like. Several of the surfaces may share the same material and depending on the home design product in question the material may need to match up at the edges of surfaces. This may be seen more clearly in the case of a striped armchair where the built 3D base model may have numerous surfaces but several surfaces may be grouped together to form surface groups so that textures applied to the surfaces will match at the edges for example. For example stripes on a back cushion may be designed to match up with stripes on a seat cushion and the two surfaces may in some situations be treated as a single surface group for purposes of applying textures. A slipcover on a couch may be modeled as different surfaces in a 3D base model but the surfaces making up the slipcover may in some situations be treated as a single surface group for purposes of applying textures. The system may leverage edge detection data used to form surfaces of the 3D base model to define where textures may be applied. The surface groupings or surface subset groupings may vary considerably depending on the particular home design product being modeled or on the portion of the product being modeled. For example for the typically pre built 3D base model see of the range of the picture see the surfaces may less complex being for example the front top panel and side surfaces. Surface groupings in a 3D base model may depend on whether the surfaces in question appear in the home design product image or are not shown or are partially obscured in the image.

The system may evaluate techniques to map textures onto the 3D base model. The textures may include for example cropped images from the home design product image or stored textures such as procedural textures that may not be part of the home design product image. A procedural texture may include a form of texture that is typically a square and is designed so that when the squares are placed together e.g. the top of one texture may match the bottom of another texture so that the squares may map properly. In the case of the armchair shown in the picture if the armchair is made of a solid white cloth material the procedural texture corresponding to the material may be white cloth. Certain cropped images from the home design product image may also be used as approximate procedural textures and mapped together to apply to a surface or surfaces.

Texture mapping techniques to be evaluated by the system may include techniques such as tiling warping and stretching. Tiling a texture may include repeating the same texture pattern usually a square texture although other shapes may be used over and over again to fill in a surface. The texture pattern may map properly like a procedural texture although other textures may be used. Stretching a texture may include stretching a cropped image or texture to meet the confines of a particular surface or surfaces. Warping a texture may include applying a texture to fill in and smooth out rough internal edges of the 3D base model. For example in a 3D base model of a sink or a tub the portion of the model that includes the basin of the sink or the inside of the tub may include rough edges at the bottom of the sink or the inside of the tub. The system may use tessellation techniques of varying complexity in 3D modeling to approximate rounded looking shapes so that a 3D base model does not include rough internal edges but the system may also or instead use texture warping effects to remove hard angles of the 3D base model.

The system may evaluate the potential texture mapping techniques based on any of a variety of factors such as data from pre built 3D base models image interpretation data including edge detection data from the home design product image commonly used surface groupings for the product model type scraped data user input or prior user feedback neural networking data or any combination of these.

The system may extract texture data from the home design product image in the form of cropped images. The cropped images may be shapes that may be tiled stretched or warped on to the surfaces of the 3D base model. The system may assemble the cropped images from the home design product image onto profiles on the main object planes and the feature level planes. The system may retrieve stored textures such as procedural textures that may not be part of the home design product image. The stored textures may be tiled or warped on to the surfaces of the 3D base model. Textures may be extracted and retrieved automatically or may be e.g. selected by a user.

The system may group the surfaces based on the evaluated surface groupings. The system may apply the extracted textures and retrieved stored textures to the surface groupings and individual surfaces using the evaluated texture mapping techniques such as warping tiling and stretching. The system may apply material properties such as reflectance to the surfaces. For example a 3D based model of a dresser with a mirror attached may have reflectance applied to a surface corresponding to the mirror.

Less complex 3D base models may include a combination of stretched cropped images on surfaces along with applied procedural textures. More complex 3D base models with a multiplicity of surfaces may have more procedural textures applied using tiling and warping to the surfaces in the 3D base model although on some surfaces stretched cropped images may be used. The system may use a recipe for applying textures to the 3D base model. In general any combination of textures including cropped images from the home design product image and stored textures may be used with any combination of texture mapping techniques including tiling stretching and warping to apply to any combination of surfaces subsets of surfaces and groups of surfaces in 3D base models.

The system may evaluate the 3D base model with the textures applied and may determine whether to apply textural details to surfaces of the image. Textural details may include bump maps or transparent textures which may include grayscale images typically having light and dark parts of varying transparency so that any underlying texture appears through the bump map or transparent texture to varying degrees. Depending on the particular bump map applied to a surface the surface may appear to be e.g. fluffy furry shagged and the like. That is the bump map or transparent texture applied to a surface may give the visual illusion that the surface has detailed features. Other standard textural details and textural detail techniques may be applied.

With any textural details and textures applied to the 3D base model the system may use the resulting 3D representation of the home design product shown in the graphical image to create a 2D drawing or 2D representation of the home design product. The system may use a top to down view of the 3D representation to create the 2D drawing. Example 2D drawings for the home design product images shown in are shown in respective . A 2D drawing of the range see is shown in . A 2D drawing of the armchair see is shown in . A 2D drawing of the kitchen stool see is shown in . A 2D drawing of the set of shelves see is shown in . In an implementation of the home design tool a 2D drawing or 2D representation may be used for example in a 2D layout of the home design tool and may be converted to the 3D representation when for example a user switches from a 2D mode to a 3D mode in the home design tool. An example 3D representation of the range see with textures applied to the 3D base model of is shown in .

In an implementation the system may use a graphical image of a home design product itself as a 3D representation of the image without resort to a 3D base model. For example sizing information such as height and width in a 2D plane for a home design product depicted in a graphical image of a home design product may be obtained from sources such as scraped data from a website of a manufacturer or retailer of the home design product user input perspective information determined from the graphical image edge detection feature detection and surface information and the like. The kitchen stool depicted in the graphical image shown in may be used to illustrate an example of this technique. The height and width and scaled dimensions of the kitchen stool may be determined from one or more of the above sources such as scraped data. The white areas within the kitchen stool may be made transparent using edge detection of the image resulting in a billboard like 3D representation of the kitchen stool that may be placed in a 3D layout. The system may draw on other dimensional information about the top of the kitchen stool to build a 2D drawing or 2D representation of the kitchen stool such as the 2D drawing of . In an implementation of the home design tool a 2D drawings or 2D representation may be used for example in a 2D layout of the home design tool and may be converted to the 3D representation when for example a user switches from a 2D mode to a 3D mode in the home design tool. The billboard like 3D representation of the kitchen stool may be located in a 3D layout based on the location of the 2D drawing in a 2D layout. The 3D representation may be sized using relative scale depending on where the 3D representation is located in a 3D layout such as a room layout. If the 3D representation is located further back in e.g. a room the 3D representation may appear smaller due to perspective. The system may apply a technique to stretch the 3D representation dynamically as perspective shifts for example as a 3D layout is rotated. The system may stretch the 3D representation dynamically in such a way that the 3D representation appears to be viewed from the side rather than from a corner the kitchen tool is shown from a corner perspective as shown in .

In an implementation upon receiving a graphical image of a home design product such as a kitchen cabinet a door a window and the like the system may build or otherwise associate with the home design product image a box shaped 3D base model of limited complexity. The system may then apply textural details and textures such as a paint color to the 3D base model to form a 3D representation of the home design product. As described above textural details may include bump maps or transparent textures which may include grayscale images typically having light and dark parts of varying transparency so that any underlying texture such as a paint color appears through it to varying degrees. Depending on the particular bump map applied to a surface the surface may appear to be e.g. fluffy furry shagged and the like. That is the bump map or transparent texture applied to a surface may give the visual illusion that the surface has detailed features. In the case of a kitchen cabinet or a door the bump map or transparent texture may give the visual illusion of a wood surface for example. Other standard textural details and textural detail techniques may be applied.

Once a graphical image of a home design product has been received by the system the system may attempt to identify and define the product type or the product model type of the home design product depicted in the graphical image. In so doing the system may retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models that correspond to the defined or identified product model type of the home design product depicted in the graphical image. Referring once again to the several examples of graphical images depicting home design products shown in the system may more easily define the product model type of the range depicted in picture of than the set of shelves depicted in picture of or even the armchair or the kitchen stool of the pictures of . Similarly the system may find one or more pre built 3D base models to associate with the range or even the armchair . An example pre built 3D base model for the range is shown in . The system may for example e.g. find no pre built 3D base model to associate with the set of shelves or for that matter the armchair . The system may then build 3D base models from scratch or on the fly in an automated process to associate with the set of shelves or the armchair . The complexity of the shape of the image of the product may impact whether the product model type may be defined whether a pre built 3D base model may be found to associate with the home design product or whether a 3D base model may be built from scratch or on the fly in an automated process. For example furniture may present more complexity than a more box shaped appliance such as a range.

As described above the system may receive the graphical image of the range of and may define the product model type of the range depicted in the picture . Upon identifying the product model type of the range the system may retrieve one or more pre built 3D base models that correspond to the defined or identified product model type of the range . For example the system may retrieve a pre built 3D base model such as the example pre built 3D base model for the range shown in . The system may also build a non complex 3D base model such as the 3D base model from scratch or on the fly depending on e.g. the complexity of the graphical image of the home design product and the product model type of the home design product.

In an implementation the system may utilize the pre built 3D base model such as the model to build the 3D representation of the home design product rather than building a 3D base model from scratch or on the fly.

For surfaces shown in the graphical image of the home design product the system may perform automated image interpretation. The system may evaluate the graphical image to define individual surfaces to extract out of the home design product image based for example on the pre built 3D base model. The system may use edge detection techniques to define the individual surfaces to extract. The system may draw on a variety of information sources to define individual surfaces for extraction including sources such as data from databases of known attributes of product types and images and adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections for example. The individual surfaces may include top front side and the like. For example for the graphical image of the range the system may detect edges to define surfaces for cropping images that may be applied as textures here cropped images to portions of the pre built 3D base model using texture mapping techniques such as stretching. The system may detect the surface as the front of the range of that may correspond to a surface of the 3D base model of . Based on the product model type the system may detect and identify grill and panel surfaces that may correspond to surfaces of the 3D base model .

In applying edge detection to find e.g. clipping areas for cropping images in the graphical image the system may detect edge detection details that may be extraneous and that need not be captured as a separate surface in a 3D base model. The system may ignore the edge detection details when defining individual surfaces from the graphical image of the home design product to apply to the 3D base model. For example on the range of the picture the system may detect via edge detection the windows of the front of the range. The system may ignore the windows as extraneous details rather than core features of the home design product and may instead define the front surface as a entire surface for cropping. The system may crop the entire front surface as one image that includes the windows as part of the image. What is an extraneous detail may in general depend on the product type of the home design product. For example for the range knobs and other instrumentation on the panel may be extraneous details. For a refrigerator the door handles may be extraneous details for example.

The system may also draw on a variety of information sources to incorporate edge detection details for certain home design products including sources such as data from databases of known attributes of product types and images and adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections for example. For example for a sink the system may detect the edges of the basin of the sink. In a 3D base model of a sink or a tub the portion of the model that includes the basin of the sink or the inside of the tub may include rough edges at the bottom of the sink or the inside of the tub. As discussed above while the system may use tessellation techniques of varying complexity in 3D modeling to approximate rounded looking shapes so that a 3D base model does not include rough internal edges the system may also or instead use the texture mapping technique of warping and may use texture warping effects to remove hard angles of the 3D base model such as the edges of the basin of a sink. Warping a texture may include applying a texture to fill in and smooth out rough internal edges of the 3D base model. In this way for example warping techniques may create the effect of a basin.

For surfaces shown in the graphical image of the home design product the system may crop images from the graphical image of the home design product and then may apply the cropped images to corresponding surfaces of a pre built 3D base model. The texture mapping technique of stretching may be used by the system to apply the textures here cropped images to the 3D base model. For the graphical image of the range the system may apply cropped images from the surfaces to corresponding surfaces of the 3D base model to form the 3D representation of the range in . The 3D representation includes a front surface a grill surface a panel surface a right side surface and a top surface . The back and right side surfaces are not shown in the particular view of the 3D representation . The sides the back and the top of the range are not shown in the graphical image of the range .

For surfaces not shown in the graphical image of the home design product the system may perform automated image interpretation. The system may automatically apply stored textures such as procedural textures described above that may not be part of the home design product image to portions of the 3D base model for which the system may not have found a corresponding surface in the graphical image of the home design product. The system may retrieve the stored textures based on scraped data from a website of a manufacturer of a retailer of the home design product such as folksonomy and taxonomy based data. For example there may be scraped data for the range that indicates that the range has surfaces made of stainless steel. The system may retrieve the stored textures based on other criteria such as data from databases of known attributes of product types and images and adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections for example. For example the system or a user of the system may have previously applied a stored texture to the same product or a product with the same or a similar product model type e.g. a product model type sharing certain characteristics as defined by e.g. a taxonomy folksonomy information and the system may leverage this knowledge to automatically apply a stored texture to the 3D base model. The system may automatically apply a stored texture using a texture mapping technique such as tiling as described above although other techniques such as warping and stretching may be used.

The system may automatically extract textures directly from the home design product image as cropped images and may automatically apply the textures to a 3D base model Certain cropped images from the home design product image may also be used as approximate procedural textures and mapped together to apply to a surface or surfaces of a 3D base model. More generally the cropped images may be shapes that may be tiled stretched or warped on to the surfaces of a 3D base model. For tiling the cropped image may typically be square. For the example of the range the system may automatically extract a cropped image of the range such as an image that shows stainless steel and may automatically tile the cropped image onto the left side not shown right side back not shown and top surfaces of the 3D base model .

The system may select a texture for extraction as a cropped image from the graphical image of the home design product based on image interpretation. The system may automatically select a texture for extraction as a cropped image based on scraped data from a website of a manufacturer of a retailer of the home design product such as folksonomy and taxonomy based data. For example there may be scraped data for the range that indicates that the range has surfaces made of stainless steel.

The system may select a texture for extraction as a cropped image from the graphical image of the home design product based on other criteria such as data from databases of known attributes of product types and images and adaptive learning using neural networks that analyze prior user design behavior and selections for example. For example the system or a user of the system may have previously extracted a texture as a cropped image for the same product or a product with the same or a similar product model type model type sharing certain characteristics as defined by e.g. a taxonomy folksonomy information . The system may know the size of and location on a product of cropped images previously extracted and may leverage this knowledge. The system may automatically apply an extracted texture using a texture mapping technique such as tiling as described above although other techniques such as warping and stretching may be used.

With any textural details and textures applied to the 3D base model of the system may use the resulting example 3D representation see of the range shown in the graphical image see to create a 2D drawing or 2D representation of the range . The system may use a top to down view of the 3D representation to create the 2D drawing. The 2D drawing of the range is shown in . In an implementation of the home design tool the 2D drawing may be used for example in a 2D layout of the home design tool and may be converted to the 3D representation when for example a user switches from a 2D mode to a 3D mode in the home design tool.

The system may provide a user with an opportunity to verify whether a 3D representation of a home design product is satisfactory and may provide the user with an opportunity to edit the 3D representation or to build a new 3D representation. The system may in some circumstances ask a user to verify edit or build a new 3D representation of a home design product or any combination of these. User verification may occur when the system scrapes a graphical image of a home design product from a website. A user may switch from a 2D mode to a 3D mode in an implementation of the home design tool and a 3D representation for a 3D layout may be presented to the user for verification and possible editing. A user may be asked to verify a 3D representation or may be given an opportunity to verify a 3D representation when the user bookmarks a home design product as shown e.g. in . In any number of such situations e.g. scraping 3D mode bookmarking a user may be provided with an interface that may allow the user to confirm or edit a 3D representation a 3D base model or textures and texture mapping for example.

In a screenshot of a webpage shows a bookmarking interface where a user may be presented with for example 2D and 3D representations of the range . The graphical image of the range of is displayed on the webpage of . As described above the system may receive a graphical image of a home design product when for example a user bookmarks a home design product and the system may automatically build 2D and 3D representations of the home design product. The 2D representation or 2D drawing and the 3D representation of the range are displayed on the webpage of . Clicking on an Edit 3D Representation button may bring up an editing interface as shown on the webpage of . The editing interface may allows a user to select a particular surface Front Grill Panel Sides Back of the 3D base model for editing on the left hand side of the editing interface . The user may select Front which may place the focus on the front surface of the 3D base model and may allow the user to work on and edit images to be applied to the front surface or may allow the user to verify that the front of the image of the range was cropped properly.

The system may provide a user with numerous editing options. For example for a graphical image of a home design product such as the range as shown in the system may present a user with a user with a home design product image such as image and may allow a user to move boundaries of shapes such as the boundaries of the rectangular shape defining the front of the range on the image . The shapes or defined surfaces may be used to crop images for application onto surfaces of a 3D base model such as the 3D base model shown in . For example the system may have cropped the image of the front of the range and applied the cropped image using a stretching texture mapping technique to the front surface of the 3D base model . A user may move the boundaries defining the surface to better define the edges of the surface for selection as a cropped image to be applied to the front surface of the 3D base model .

In an implementation the system may allow a user to define new surfaces on a home design product image or a 3D base model. The system may allow a user to design or edit her own 3D base model using for example basic drawing tools such as rectangles. The system may allow a user to apply textures to an existing 3D base model or to her own designed or edited 3D base model.

The system may allow a user to edit surfaces not shown in a graphical image of a home design product. The system may allow a user to draw a boundary around a portion of the home design product image and may allow the user to apply the cropped image as a texture using texture mapping techniques such as tiling warping or stretching to surfaces of a 3D base model not shown in the graphical image. The system may allow a user to confirm select or edit a stored texture such as a procedural texture for the system to apply to surfaces of the 3D base model not shown in the graphical image.

For example referring to the editing interface the user may select Sides Back which may place the focus of the interface on the surfaces of the 3D base model e.g. sides and back surfaces such as the right surface that are not shown in the graphical image of the range . The system may permit the user to choose a texture from the existing image or a stored texture such as a procedural texture to apply to the sides and back surfaces of the 3D base model . The system may not have applied a texture to surfaces of the 3D base model not shown in the graphical image so that when a user selects Sides Back in the editing interface the system may present the user with different options for textures to apply to the 3D base model surfaces. The system may suggest a stainless steel stored texture that the system retrieved by e.g. learning from scraped data that the range has stainless steel surfaces. The system may evaluate the graphical image to find a texture on the image that most closely approximates e.g. the color of stainless steel and present the texture to the user for example.
