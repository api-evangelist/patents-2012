No. 12 148 076 which was filed on Apr. 15 2008 and this Continuation in Part is being filed under 35 U.S.C.

The present invention generally relates to a method and a system of signal collection networks. In particular the present invention concerns a method and a system for spectrum mapping and exploitation using distributed sensors together with multi sensor fusion.

Non cooperative demodulation is a technique to demodulate communication signals without hand shaking between the transmitter and the receiver. This technique has been widely used in both military and commercial communications battlefield surveillance hostile signal detection and signal monitoring. In non cooperative communications the receiver has no knowledge or only has limited knowledge of the transmitting signal for example the signal monitoring devices may not know the format of the signal being monitored in tactical or hostile environment involving military or law enforcement operations. Non cooperative demodulation will be used in non cooperative communication.

Automatic modulation classification is a key component in non cooperative demodulation for recognizing the modulation scheme of a transmitted signal without prior knowledge of the signal ground truth and cueing the software defined radio to choose the proper built in demodulator. Although significant research has been conducted on automatic modulation classification methods during the last two decades this research has been limited to single receiver situations where the classification performance and recognition of a successful rate have largely depended on channel quality and the receiver signal strength. These conditions do not ordinarily apply to non cooperative communications because in a non cooperative communication environment particularly in military applications the received signal at the single sensor is usually very weak so that the single sensor modulation classification of an unknown weak signal is usually difficult and unreliable.

Further prior art automatic modulation classification devices and methods do not adequately account for multiple receiver situations such as sensor networks whose uses have become more and more popular. Due to the dramatic and widespread use of sensor networks single sensor monitoring is now considered to be inadequate.

Thus there has been a long felt need for better signal monitoring techniques that lead to more effective modulation classification of weak signals without suffering from the limitations shortcomings and difficulties of single receiver configurations such as receiving weak signals and classifying the unknown weak signal.

The data storage module can also be coupled to the SEU and to the distributed sensors for storing information from the SEU and from the distributed sensors.

The present invention is also directed to a method for operating a distributed multi sensor system for spectrum mapping and signal exploitation comprising selecting a plurality of distributed sensors including at least one or more clusters of distributed sensors sending a request to the plurality of distributed sensors to collect signal snapshot copies routing signal snapshot copies or information from the plurality of distributed sensors as inputs to at least one fusion module processing all inputs before sending any next request to the plurality of distributed sensors optimizing the one or more clusters of distributed sensors combining multiple distributed signal inputs in the at least one fusion module and making a global decision.

In accordance with the present invention fusing multiple signals in connection with non cooperative demodulation affords a more effective demodulation without suffering from the limitations shortcomings and difficulties of single receiver configurations such as receiving weak signals and classifying the unknown weak signal. is a diagram illustrating a typical communication sensor network with an unknown transmitter T and N number of communication sensors denoted by R R . . . and R. The unknown transmitted signal is transmitted by a transmitter T and is collected by sensors R R . . . and Rnon cooperatively. In this diagram the sensors can communicate with each other cooperatively but they do not need to be fully connected. The sensors have no hand shaking with the unknown transmitter T.

An output estimate A is sent to a means for modulation scheme classification that selects the appropriate demodulation technique for demodulating the unknown signals s t such as PSK8 FSK2 and QAM16. The signal demodulation means classifies the unknown signals s t and provides a demodulated signal with improved fidelity and reliability allowing the user to better conduct hostile signal detection surveillance and monitoring.

This invention s multi sensor demodulation device eliminates signal variables such as the power of the channel noise disturbances and combined interference by taking advantage of the spatial diversity and randomness of those unknown terms and digitizing a fragment of the received signal r t to K samples. The resolution of the combined digitized signal depends upon the sampling rate. Since the sampling clocks at the receiving sensors and N are asynchronous and jittering in a given time frame the digitized receiving signals r kT have a small time offset referencing to the first receiving sensor . It is reasonable to assume the sampling time period Tis fixed within the analysis time frame the signal r kT can be described by

The cooperation between the master and slaves is a critical element of the signal fusion aspect of the present invention. The signal transmission from slaves to the master is asynchronous in time since all data fragments are sent as packets. Furthermore when the communications among sensors are cooperative the channel distortion to the data transmission can be compensated and the data can be recovered reliably by using various existing techniques such as error coding interleaving and equalization. The received packet at the master contains K signal samples which are described by 

Usually a preprocessing operation is needed to exclude the outlier packets based on the estimated signal to noise ratios SNRs and to normalize the packets based on the signal powers before estimating the delay factor and combining the signals. Thus the multi sensor demodulation device provides signal fusion automatic demodulation modulation scheme classification and the appropriate demodulation technique to effectively monitor the collected non cooperative unknown signals without suffering form the disadvantages shortcomings and limitations of prior art techniques and devices.

This invention can be implemented in either in hardware or software. is a software programming flowchart that illustrates the operation of software in this invention s multi sensor signal fusion article of manufacture with a storage medium encoded with machine readable computer program code for more accurate descriptions of monitored signals. The software programming flowchart depicts the software operations of the signal preprocessing delay factor estimation and signal combining processes.

Referring now to when this invention is implemented with software the software operation begins with collecting signals in a means for collecting signals and storing data represented by Block where signals collected from multiple sensors are transmitted to a digital signal processing unit in the master and stored in the memory for processing. In Block a coarse SNR estimation is conducted in a means for coarse estimation in order to eliminate the outliers based on the SNR threshold. In a means for sorting represented by Block the SNRs are sorted from high to low and signals with a SNR below a given threshold are excluded. In Block a means for normalization normalizes signals above a given threshold and in a means for signal labeling represented by Block the signals are labeled from 1 to N that is r k j 1 2 . . . N based on the estimated values of SNRs. Here the index j is not related to the indices of the sensors. In Block a means for correlating receives the signal with the highest SNR r k and correlates it with r k to obtain the delay factor circumflex over m in Block . In Block a means for calculating averages r k and r k circumflex over m which are defined as r k and continuing the similar process as shown in for r k r k . . . r k finishes the looping process with the Block correlating means and Block delay factor resulting in a combined signal fed to a signal detection and modulation classification block for estimating the modulation scheme. Many of the variations of the multi sensor demodulation device also apply to this invention s article of manufacture software embodiment.

The signals are collected by sensor antennas and sent to Analog to Digital Converters and and then digitized by a local clock and where i i 1 2 . . . N and saved in a local memory module and . The master sensor collects the multiple signal packets from local memories then estimates coarse SNRs in a means for SNR estimation excludes outliers in a means for sorting and then normalizes all the signals in a means for signal fusion . A transmission delay factor is estimated and then the signals are correlated in a means for signal correlation . Interpolation and over sampling will be applied if needed. The signals are shifted and combined in a means for signal combining before feeding to the automatic modulation classification block . only demonstrates two sensors one is the master and the other is the slave. The same architecture works for a large sensor network with massive numbers of slaves. Parallel processing can be used for estimating the delay factor and combing signals. Multiple master sensors can be used to distribute the signal fusion process in accordance with the present invention. Many of the variations of the multi sensor demodulation device also apply to this invention s master slave sensor configurations.

Referring now to the drawings are charts illustrating simulation results of a single sensor and a multi sensor signal fusion with matched filters that demonstrate the advantages in using multi sensor signal fusion in accordance with this invention. The computer simulations were conducted by combining signals received from 100 receiving sensors. The SNR ratio and signal length at each single sensor is 0 dB and 512 samples respectively. The signals are modulated as 16 QAM with root raised cosine filters. The roll off factor is 0.25 and the over sample rate is 4 samples per symbol. In order to simplify the simulations all signals were digitized synchronously in time and modulation phase. The results of these computer simulations are shown in . The dots in are recovered symbols at a single sensor which are very noisy and are not recognizable for any constellation pattern. By contrast the multi sensor signal fusion dots are arranged in a much clearer constellation pattern of 16 clusters. Therefore the unknown signal is classified as QAM16 modulation scheme.

Matched filters were used in the and simulations. illustrates the simulation result of multi sensor signal fusion without matched filters because in most non cooperative communication operations the structure of the matched filter is not always known so the matched filter cannot be used in those situations. The dots in are the recovered symbols after multi sensor signal fusion with no matched filter. Although the 16 clusters in are not as concentrated as those in those skilled in the art should readily recognize them and classify the unknown signal as the QAM16 modulation scheme. After comparing the single sensor results with the and multi signal fusion results it is readily apparent that the single sensor modulation scheme at SNR 0 dB is almost impossible to discern while the and multi sensor results quite readily allow estimating the modulation scheme even if the SNR is quite low.

The multi sensor signal fusion technique can be developed in various implementations and embodiments. The concept applies to both analog and digital signals in any wired or wireless communication network with various architectures to a wide frequency range and to the channels in harsh environments.

This multi sensor non cooperative linear digital signal demodulation device comprises a coarse modulation parameter estimation unit and a fine modulation parameter estimation unit . The signals are collected by sensor antennas and combined by a signal fusion means not shown in this drawing. Referring now to the coarse estimation unit the fused multi sensor signal is used for coarse estimations of the center frequency in a means for center frequency estimation coarse estimations of bandwidth in a means for bandwidth estimation and coarse SNR estimations in a means for SNR estimation . The signal is down converted and filtered in a first band pass filter based on the coarse estimations of the center frequency and bandwidth. Then a filtered signal output is provided to a means for symbol rate estimation and a means for signal re sampling to the integer number of samples per symbol. The signal re sampling means sends a sampled filtered output to the fine modulation parameter estimation unit which functions as a master sensor.

Referring now to the fine estimation unit or master sensor the residual center frequency is removed from the sampled filtered output and the signal is mixed and filtered once again with a second band pass filter that is tighter than the first band pass filter . The twice filtered output signal is down sampled to the symbol rate if needed in a means for down sampling before channel estimation is performed in a means for channel estimation and before channel equalization occurs in a means for channel equalization . The modulation phase offset is estimated in means for phase estimation and corrected in a means for phase correction . A maximum likelihood algorithm software module estimates the most likely modulation scheme based on the estimated SNR and possible modulation schemes stored in a modulation schemes storage module . The confidence of the modulation estimation is measured in a means for estimation measurement and estimation results including modulation scheme SNR bandwidth symbol rate center frequency residual and estimation confidence are reported in final estimate represented by arrow once the multi sensor signal is obtained and combined. The automatic modulation classification does not depend on and is not limited to the signal fusion methods. In other words any existing or new automatic modulation classification methods can be used in this invention. Many of the variations of the multi sensor demodulation device also apply to this invention s multi sensor non cooperative linear digital signal demodulation embodiment.

Referring now to there is depicted a flow diagram of the steps of this invention s method for achieving increased fidelity and more reliable simulation of monitored non cooperative signals with multi sensor non cooperative demodulation comprising the steps of receiving non cooperative signals s t from an unknown transmission source in a group of sensors each of the sensors having a sampling clock and a local memory with the non cooperative signals having weak signals a given modulation and a given demodulation digitizing a group of received signals with the group of sensors providing digitized signals with the digitized signals including the multiple non cooperative signals and transmitting the digitized signals to a signal fusion sensor which are represented by Block . The step of providing a coarse SNR estimation from a means for coarse estimation to extract the weak signals based on a coarse SNR threshold is represented by Block and the step of sorting the digitized signals according to an SNR value below a given threshold in a means for sorting is represented by Block . The step of normalizing digitized signals with SNR above a given threshold is represented by Block and the step of labeling the high SNR digitized signals in a means for signal labeling based on multiple estimated SNR values is represented by Block .

This invention s method continues with the steps of generating a combined digitized signal with a maximum SNR value r k in a means for correlating represented by Block correlating the maximum SNR digitized signals with r k to obtain a delay factor circumflex over m represented by Block averaging r k and r k circumflex over m in a means for calculating represented by Block and transmitting a combined digitized signal to a means for automatic modulation for a modulation output estimate represented by Block . Block represents the final steps of sending the modulation output estimate to a means for modulation scheme classification that selects a demodulation technique by evaluating the modulation output estimate and the given demodulation generating a matching demodulation output in the modulation scheme classification means sending the matching demodulation output to a means for signal demodulation to generate a demodulated signal and simulating the non cooperative signals without unwanted channel noise disturbances and interference allowing a user to covertly identify and monitor the unknown transmission source with an improved fidelity and reliability. Many of the variations of the multi sensor demodulation device also apply to this invention s methods.

The present invention can be continued to including asynchronous and non coherent sensors to the network. In this scenario there are time phase and frequency offsets among asynchronous sensors. Two methods are presented they are signal decision fusion and raw signal fusion. Hardware and software components comprising radio frequency RF sensors and communication network fusion centers a spectrum exploitation unit SEU and a data storage device as shown in . The fusion center master or interacts with distributed RF sensors slaves and via the communication network to collect the signal of interest SOI at the distributed locations. The signal collected at the RF sensor is called a local signal copy. Multiple local signal copies or the processing results of the multiple local signal copies are delivered to the fusion center to form a statistical decision. More than one fusion center may be deployed such as and . The decision is a set of estimation result used by the SEU for spectrum mapping and exploitation.

In a given frequency band or range time frame and geographic location there may exist many signals. The SOI is the one that the SEU will exploit. In one preferred embodiment the SOI can be transmitted by any RF equipment in any format which includes but is not limited to the signal using single or multiple antennas single and multiple carrier frequencies frequency spreading or hopping various multiple access or multiplexing analog or digital modulation with all possible modulation and coding schemes etc.

The RF Sensor and in this application can be a device which can follow the request of the fusion center to capture a SOI for a very short period of time store it in a temporary memory and pass raw or processed signal copies to the fusion center or . The sensor and can be homogeneous or heterogeneous and the sensor network such as sensor cluster or can be synchronous or asynchronous. The sensor and can be as simple as a RF relay unit or as complex as a blind signal classifier BSC or a specific emitter identifier SEI . As shown in each sensor and has an antenna . In this application two categories of sensors are employed thick and thin sensors.

A thick sensor is designed to perform the required RF signal collection and processing functions. It can be used or ready to be used as a stand along device such as those shown at in . A thick sensor is usually a sophisticated and expensive device with powerful signal processing capability designed and tailored for applications such as blind signal parameter estimation modulation classification and emitter identification. The thick sensor is able to make decisions soft or hard locally.

A thin sensor is a basic RF transceiver with very limited signal processing options such as carrier frequency tuning filtering and analog to digital or digital to analog conversion in order to pass the raw data to the fusion center or properly. It is usually an inexpensive widely available and less accurate device. However the thin sensor can also be a part of a thick sensor. That is a thick sensor which only offers limited functions or operations to the fusion center for spectrum exploitation as if it is a thin one. Many existing RF equipments such as radios WiFi devices and wireless phones can be leveraged as thin sensors to perform the RF spectrum sensing for the fusion center under an agreement with no or little modification to the equipments. Since the fusion center in this scenario will be the secondary user the sensing function will be operated in the background or during idling session of the equipments without interfering or interrupting the primary functions. The thin sensor is usually not able to make exploitation decision locally.

Thick and thin sensors and can be used collaboratively for the fusion center or although the method of data processing will be handled differently. Both types of sensors and can be custom made devices programmable devices existing radios or software defined radios wireless phones etc. The sensors collect a snapshot a short time duration of the signal as local signal copies under the request of the fusion center or . The sensors and in the network and may or may not be synchronized and coherent. The processing power in the fusion center or will be sufficient in most applications since the signal collection task is performed periodically in the spectrum exploitation unit .

In one preferred embodiment the communication network sends a request to all participated distributed sensors and transports the raw signal copies or information obtained from the signal copies from the distributed sensors and to the fusion center or and feedback the spectrum exploitation result from SEU to the sensors and if needed. The collected signals may be sent in the form of time stamped data packets via any available route and suitable means wired or wireless and any modulations and multiplexing accesses methods. An existing communication network may be used fully or partly for spectrum exploitation applications as the second user under an agreement. In this case the network security reliability and hand shaking between networked sensors and are all handled by the existing communication network .

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the fusion center or applies all the necessary or appropriate signal processing functions to the raw signal copies or the information obtained from the signal copies in order to combine the multiple inputs delivered by distributed sensors and to a single output using statistics means. Depending on the application requirements the inputs can be the information obtained from local signal copies such as the local hard soft decisions or raw partially processed local signal copies. The outputs can be a global decision of a group of parameters formats and support data of the SOI including but not limited to carrier frequency and sub carrier frequencies bandwidth symbol rate and pulse shape signal power modulation scheme modulation index signal to noise ratio SNR headers and prefixes coding methods transmitter type and license as well as emitter locations. The fusion center or chooses a set of sensors and from all available sensors and to form a best cluster network based on the best knowledge of the operation requirements environment quality and geometrical conditions. For a massive sensor network multiple clusters such as exemplary clusters and with multiple fusion centers such as or may be needed or used and the multiple outputs will be further combined to a meta global decision such as that shown in one embodiment in before sending to the SEU for spectrum exploitation as shown in .

In the exemplary preferred embodiment shown in a single sensor such as a thick sensor can make a decision which can be sent to a fusion center or which can process decision which is transmitted or forwarded to fusion center or . In addition several sensors and such as thin sensors and as shown in can provide raw signals and respectively that are transmitted or forwarded to fusion center or wherein the raw signals can be combined or processed into decision . Then the processed decision and decision can be combined or processed into a meta decision which can be sent to the SEU .

Depending on the application a fusion center may include a blind signal classifier BSC and or a specific emitter identifier SEI which takes an input signal with unknown modulation scheme and unknown parameters such as carrier frequency and phase symbol time duration bandwidth power SNR etc. and provide the estimates for all desired unknowns. In one exemplary embodiment a fusion center or can also be a part of a sensor and .

The current state of the art BSC can process a received signal in the form of with an unknown vector x including all unknown signal and channel parameters such as modulation index carrier frequency and phase pulse shape and timing channel magnitude and phase SNR oversampling rate and bandwidth. If the signal uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex OFDM it also includes the unknown OFDM modulation parameters such as cyclic prefix FFT size etc. In the above equation s t is the transmitting analytic signal n t is additive white Gaussian noise AWGN with unknown noise various e describes the non coherency between the transmitter and receiver and h t is the unknown channel impulse response including the receiver gain. Some BSC are equipped with blind equalizer to compensate the unknown fading and pulse shaping.

The Specific Emitter Identifier SEI identifies the features such as the finger print the dynamic response and the assigned code which is unique to a specific emitter. Depending on the application a priori art or well know art can be used for SEI. The identification result is sent to the SEU for spectrum mapping and exploitation.

As shown in and the Spectrum Exploitation Unit SEU uses the decision provided by the fusion centers for spectrum mapping and exploitation applications such as spectrum monitoring and regulation . The SEU can feedback useful information to the sensors and in distributed locations which includes but is not limited to available frequency spectrum emitter locations channel conditions signal power requirement primary and secondary spectrum users information threat warming interferences network routing paths etc. The SEU may include hardware and software such as custom made processors or a computer human machine interface data storage communication interface and software or firmware.

Referring now to the fusion methods that can be employed according to present invention are discussed below. Both decision fusion and raw signal fusion can be used for distributed signal copies.

In the decision fusion method the exemplary embodiments include hard decision fusion and raw data fusion. If a decision such as an estimated modulation scheme for a local signal copy is available hard decision fusion can be used. As shown in the hard decisions are combined in the fusion center to yield a global decision . Decision fusion applies to the signal copies collected from both thick and thin sensors and which may be considered as slaves as shown in . The slaves may include sensors up to L which provide decisions and respectively. The thick sensors make independent decisions locally and then send them to the fusion center in order to reduce the data transmission bandwidth as shown in . On the other hand the thin sensors deliver the raw signal snapshots to the fusion center and the decisions are made in the fusion center for all received signal copies. Since all the decisions are made independently this method does not need accurate synchronization and coherence among signal copies. However the former occupies much less transmission bandwidth since only the compressed data decisions are sent to the processing or fusion center . Decisions can be made in various ways and many existing investigations are available for decision making. Maximum likelihood test is an example which assumes u u . . . uto be L independent decisions with Q hypotheses and make the global decision d Hbased on the conditional probability

For multiple unknowns hard decisions for all unknowns need to be made. In other words the above process will be repeated until all unknowns are decided.

Referring now to if a soft decision for a local signal copy is available soft decision fusion can be used. The soft decisions are combined in the fusion center to yield a global decision . Like the hard decision case soft decision fusion applies to the signal copies collected from both thick and thin sensors and which may be considered as slaves as shown in . The slaves may include sensors up to L which provide soft decisions and respectively. The thick sensors make independent soft decisions locally then send the scores to the fusion center in order to reduce the data transmission bandwidth as shown in . As was the case with hard decision fusion the thin sensor delivers the raw signal snapshots to the fusion center . Then the soft decisions are made in the fusion center for all received signal copies. Soft decision fusion does not give the solid results locally but provides a set of scores leading to the hard decision. For example in the maximum likelihood based Base Station Controller BSC in the linear digital modulation classification among Q hypotheses and will provide Q scores related to the likelihood values. Those scores from all distributed sensors are soft decisions combined within the fusion center to provide a soft decision fusion to yield a global decision . Like hard decision cases the soft decision fusion does not need accurate synchronization and coherence among sensors and and the thick sensor occupies much less transmission bandwidth.

Although the soft decision fusion method is a little less bandwidth efficient compared with the hard decision one it loses less information and usually demonstrates a better decision making performance. Soft decisions can be implemented in various ways. An example is to use maximum likelihood as shown below. Assuming r r . . . rare L independent input strings sent to the maximum likelihood estimator with Q hypotheses the global decision d His made by choosing

For multiple unknowns soft decisions for all unknowns need to be made. In other words the above process will be repeated until all unknowns are decided.

Referring now to these are conceptual block diagrams of a raw data fusion method which can be either synchronous or asynchronous respectively.

When only thin sensors are used the decisions cannot be made locally. As shown in if the signal copies are coherent and synchronous the synchronized signal fusion method will be used. Otherwise as shown conceptually in the fusion center will conduct post synchronization to compensate the time frequency and phase offsets among signal copies and the asynchronous signal fusion method will be used.

Referring to in synchronous signal fusion if it is assumed that the carrier frequencies and timings among signal copies are synchronous in time and frequency and the Doppler effect is negligible then the received signal at the lsensor as for 1 2 . . . when s t x is the SOI x is a vector of unknown parameters which can be estimated by BSC or SET with well known a priori art h t is the channel impulse response including the receiver gain is the convolution operation and n t is AWGN.

The SOI can be received along various channels to a predetermined number L by corresponding slave sensors to the predetermined number L . A means for synchronization according to well known a priori art can be employed to provide that the SOI copies to the predetermined number L are synchronous and coherent when transmitted to and received by the master or fusion center .

The distributed signal copies SOI copies to L can be combined by finding the best set of filters g t l 1 2 . . . L such that the combined signal

Optimization methods such as maximum ratio combining and beam forming can be used to calculate g t . For example in the embodiment shown in the filtered SOI copies to L can be combined in a mixer .

The SNR of the combined signal can be further improved by using the post synchronization to compensate phase offsets among signal copies to L to achieve the coherent signal combining.

Asynchronous signal fusion can be employed when the distributed signal copies are not coherent and synchronous. In this case there exist not only the parameter offsets between the transmitting and receiving signals but also the offsets among all distributed sensors and due to the differences in local oscillators sampling clocks channels Doppler effects etc.

As was the case with synchronous signal fusion the SOI can be received along various channels to a predetermined number L by corresponding slave sensors to the predetermined number L . The SOI copies to the predetermined number L are synchronous and coherent when transmitted to and received by the master or fusion center .

Denoting fas the carrier frequency offset between the lsignal copy and the reference which can be selected as sensor as the carrier phase offset between the lsignal copy and the reference and as the carrier frequency offset between the lsignal copy and the reference the offsets can be compensated with post synchronization in a means for post synchronization within fusion center without physically synchronizing the sensors or estimating the offsets in sensors locally . Well known a prior art can be used to estimate the offset in an offsets estimator within fusion center . A straight forward solution is to find the best estimates of f and such that

The goal of combining the distributed local signal copies is to enhance the SNR. Under the ideal conditions the processing gain of L will be achieved. Although the raw signal fusion occupies more transmission bandwidth compared with the decision fusion method the former provides faithful local information without compression so that the fusion performance is better. It is remarkable that only a very short signal snapshot is collected in the local sensors and and transmitted to the fusion center and the probability P r H used in the decision fusion is not needed in this approach.

The operation process and components for the fusion methods is shown in and also the flow charts of . The fusion or processing center master chooses or selects an initial cluster of sensors slaves distributed around the SOI and broadcasts a request to the sensors for collecting a snapshot of the SOI .

Available sensors as shown in receive the request from the fusion sensor along channel respond along channel to the master request and scan the SOI in the given frequency range. After finding the SOI the sensors collect a short timeframe of data snapshots signal copies in distributed locations with time stamps .

The snapshots of local signal copies or the information obtained from local signal copies can be routed or transmitted via channel directly to the fusion center as time stamped packets through the existing communication network so the order of the packets is not important and multiple receiving channels in the fusion center are not necessary. The fusion center processes all inputs before sending the next request . The inputs can be delivered either as the raw analytic signal samples along channel or they can be routed or transmitted via channel after hard soft decisions are made locally by the sensors .

The fusion center processing all inputs can perform various functions in a coarse signal estimation module for coarse signal classification in a channel analysis unit for coarse channel analysis in an emitter localization module for coarse emitter localization. The fusion center in an optimal clustering module can optimize the cluster or clusters to minimize interference channel distortion and multiple users and maximize the signal to noise ratio. Well known a priori art can be used for optimizing the cluster.

The fusion center combines the multiple distributed inputs in a fusion module to yield a single output along routes and for signal exploitation. If the inputs are local hard soft decisions a hard soft decision fusion method can be used and the output will be the global decision of the signal estimation. If the inputs are raw data of synchronous signal copies the synchronous signal fusion method can be used to form a combined signal. If the inputs before fusion module are raw data of asynchronous signal copies asynchronous raw signal fusion method can be applied to yield a combined signal. The fusion output for the combined signal is a decision which is a group of parameters and signal format related to spectrum modulation and other desired signal parameters and identities. If the inputs are a mix of raw data and decisions both raw signal and decision fusion methods will be used appropriately to calculate the meta global decision.

The fusion center can pass the multiple signal copies to an emitter localization module . Many a priori art techniques can be applied such as Received Signal Strength Difference Time of Arrival Angle of Arrival Time Difference of Arrival Frequency Difference of Arrival etc to determine the localization of the signals. The goal of distributed emitter localization is to average the localization results provided by local sensors in order to minimized the localization error. Therefore low cost and low accurate sensors can be used. The multiple signal copies can also be sent along channel to a classification module which provides for determining at least the modulation methods used for the signals.

After the signals are classified and localized they can be sent to a decision module in which a global decision can be made concerning the signals.

The global decision can be outputted from the fusion center to the SEU to a spectrum mapping module for spectrum mapping and to an exploitation module for spectrum monitoring and regulation. The spectrum map is used for spectrum monitoring such as detecting unused spectrum identifying primary users classifying adversaries detecting interferences etc.

The various processing results from the fusion center can be routed or transmitted along channel for storage in data storage module . Also the processing results from the SEU can be routed or transmitted along channel for storage in data storage module . Signal information from the SEU can also be routed or transmitted along channel to the distributed sensors to provide updated instructions for operation and optimizing the communication network .

Multiple fusion centers may be used for a massively or multi distributed sensor network to form a system of systems for spectrum exploitation. The global decisions from the fusion centers can be further fused to form a meta global decision. As shown for example in the sensor network can include one or more individual single sensors together with at least one cluster either or and their corresponding sensors and respectively. In the case of the sensor network of one or more individual sensors and cluster the sensors transmit or route their signals to fusion center which receives signals from sensors within cluster . The one or more single sensors can also route or transmit their signals to fusion center which is included in the cluster . Then fusion center can communicate with the SEU .

In an alternative embodiment one or more individual single sensors can be combined with cluster . In this instance all sensors of cluster route or transmit their signals and sensor transmit its local decision to fusion center which is outside of cluster . Fusion center in turn communicates with SEU .

In yet another alternative embodiment one or more individual single sensors can be combined with both clusters and in the arrangement as shown in . In this instance the sensors of cluster route or transmit their signals to fusion center which the sensors of cluster route or transmit their signals to fusion center . The one or more individual sensors can route or transmit their signals to either fusion center or fusion center . Fusion centers and can each communicate with SEU .

Other preferred alternative embodiments employing additional combinations of cluster types and with or without one or more individual single sensors can be employed.
