Service providers and device manufacturers e.g. wireless cellular etc. are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by for example providing compelling services. Service providers and device manufacturers are also continually challenged by content providers to deliver new ways for consumers to experience content. One area of interest to service providers device manufacturers and content providers is providing a more realistic experience for consumers when consuming content. For example device manufacturers have developed devices e.g. televisions projectors mobile phones etc. that are able to present multimedia content e.g. movies television programming etc. to consumers such that the consumers visualize the content in three dimensions. Further certain movie theaters may present movies that consumers perceive in three dimensions in addition to tactile interactions with the consumers such as vibrations and or sprays of fluids e.g. air water etc. . Additionally manufacturers have developed devices that consumers may use to interact with the presentation of content that simulate real world devices. For example many video games are associated with special devices such as rifles golf clubs motion sensing controllers that simulate one or more real world devices that are represented in the game. Content providers have similarly developed content to interact with the simulated devices. However to experience such perceived increase in realism consumers must for example purchase specialized equipment e.g. three dimensional compatible displays simulated devices etc. or go to specialized theaters that have specially formatted movies and or specially configured equipment. Yet even with the specialized equipment the content does not use the reality around the user and does not interact with the user personally. For example when a user is participating with a game even if participating with a device that simulates a real world device the user is not psychologically immersed into the game. The user still understands the difference between playing the game and the real world outside of the game. Thus the user is not psychologically immersed into the content at least in part because the content is not interacting with everyday devices associated with the user. Therefore the consumer is not fully immersed in the content. Accordingly service providers device manufacturers and content providers face significant challenges in immersing consumers in content that interacts with consumers personally using everyday devices associated with the consumers.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for providing immersive interaction via everyday devices based on one or more immersive interaction events.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for providing immersive interaction via everyday devices based on one or more immersive interaction events are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Despite these advances users still understand that such sensory feedback is not real. Users understand that the perceived three dimensions associated with a display are merely an illusion. For increased realism that includes for example tactile feedback users still must go to specially equipped movie theaters to experience the three dimensional movies with the additional sensory feedback. Such movie theater settings take away from the users experiences because the users must experience the content with the other users in the theater. Thus the experience is not personal. The experience does not interact with the users individual spaces. Thus the users are not fully immersed into the experience provided by the content.

Further when consuming certain types of content the content may be associated with one or more devices specifically made for the content to interact with the content. However because the devices are specially made for the content the devices often only work with the content and have no other use. Even further some devices are intended to simulate real world devices such as game controllers that are in the shape of a guitar or rifle. Although the devices are visually similar the visual similarity is the extent of the similarities and the devices have no other functionality beyond being associated with the presentation of content. For example the devices do not represent everyday devices that have functionality that is not specific to the presentation of content. Thus although the users may be able to use devices that are visually similar to real world devices the devices are imitating the users do not experience a full psychological relationship with the content through the device. There is no psychological relationship between the user and the device because for example the user is using a device specifically made for the content rather than a device that may be used in the real world independently from the presentation of the content or that the user uses on a daily basis. Accordingly service providers and device manufacturers face significant challenges in fully immersing users in presentations of content. There are significant challenges that must be overcome to personalize user s experiences associated with consuming content while limiting the additional specialized equipment necessary to achieve such personalized experiences.

To address these problems a system of introduces the capability to provide immersive interaction via everyday devices based on one or more immersive interaction events. The system enables content e.g. a movie a song a television program a computer game a video etc. to interact with a user. The system provides for the control of one or more devices associated with a user and or associated with an environment associated with a user via one or more control signals sent via one or more protocols. The one or more control signals are associated with one or more immersive interaction events within the content. The devices may represent any type of everyday device is that able to accept one or more control signals via the one or more protocols. The devices may be everyday devices that are otherwise unrelated to the presentation of the content such that the devices have functionality beyond functionality associated with presenting the content. However the term everyday device does not require that the device is used every day. By way of example an everyday device that has functionality beyond functionality associated with presenting content may be a washing machine a dishwasher a microwave oven a toaster a radio a clock etc. In one embodiment the one or more devices may include devices that present the content but otherwise have functionality unrelated to presenting the content. By way of example the devices may have various different components that may be otherwise unrelated to presenting the content and may be controlled based on the one or more commands and or control signals. For instance modern mobile phones have increased functionality beyond merely making phone calls such that the mobile phones may now present content such as movies videos music and the like. However functionality of the mobile phones such as the call functionality is still unrelated to the functionality of presenting the content. The protocols may be for example Bluetooth WLAN radio or any other protocol discussed herein e.g. one or more protocols discussed with respect to the communication network . Thus the system enables the ability to detect one or more devices that are not specifically configured or associated with the presentation of content or use one or more other components in a device that is presenting content but are otherwise unrelated to the presentation of the content and immerse the devices into the presentation of content. By immersing the devices into the presentation of content the system provides the ability to immerse the user into the presentation of the content by associating the content with the devices surrounding the user.

In one embodiment content presented by one or more devices may include for example metadata associated with one or more immersive interaction events. In one embodiment content presented by one or more devices may include for example explicit code instructions that are created dynamically and dependent on the devices within the system based on one or more immersive interaction events. The system may determine the one or more immersive interaction events based on the presence of the metadata within the content and or the explicit code. The system may further process the immersive interaction events to determine what devices within the system are compatible with the immersive interaction events. Based on the presence of one or more compatible devices within the system the system may transmit one or more control signals to the devices using one or more protocols to cause the devices to perform the functionality and or action associated with the metadata explicit code and or immersive interaction event within the content. Accordingly the system may immerse the devices within the content based on the immersive interaction events and a determination of what devices are associated with such events.

The system may further immerse the content into the one or more devices to create a symbiotic relationship between the content and the one or more everyday devices. The system allows for the transmittal and or retrieval and display of information from the content to one or more user interfaces on the devices. The users of the devices may then interact with one or more representations of the content of the displays of the devices to interact with the content. Thus the users may use their everyday devices to interact with the content to create a fully immersed experience. By way of example interacting with the native user interfaces of a device allows a user to interface with one or more representations of the content and thereby interact with the content. Because the users are interacting with the user interfaces of their everyday devices the users become fully immersed in the content.

By way of example while playing a movie on a DVD player connected to a television one or more actions one or more functions and or one or more characteristics may occur within the movie that are associated with a mobile phone represented in the movie. For instance a character within the movie may receive a phone call on their mobile phone and their mobile phone may ring. The system provides the capability to cause a mobile phone associated with a user watching the movie to receive a phone call and therefore have their mobile phone ring at the same time the mobile phone rings in the movie. The system further allows the mobile phone of the user to display information regarding the call that corresponds to the information within the movie. For example if the character Robert Morris is calling a character in the movie the user s device may display that the incoming call is from Robert Morris. Further if the user subsequently looks at his contacts application he may see an entry associated with the character Robert Morris. Thus the system allows for a personalized experience for a user enjoying content by immersing the user into the content using one or more everyday devices associated with the user that otherwise are not associated with presenting the content and have functionality beyond presenting the content. For instance in the above example where the DVD player and the television are presenting the movie the mobile phone is an everyday device that is used for other actions and or other functions besides presenting the movie. Thus when the user receives a phone call on the mobile phone the user will treat the phone call as any other phone call and perceive the phone call as being part of the real world rather than associated with the virtual world of the movie.

The system may further create multiple immersion levels or nested immersion levels where levels of content may be immersed within other levels of content. Thus the system may immerse a user into multiple levels of virtual reality through the immersion of a device in multiple levels of content. By way of example while experiencing content associated with walking through a virtual simulation of a city e.g. New York that is related to one level of immersion a user may execute an augmented reality application. The system may immerse the user and the augmented reality application such that the application is immersed within the virtual simulation of the city. Thus although the user is not actually in the city but is instead within a virtual simulation of the city the augmented reality application is immersed within the virtual simulation and respond as if actually present in the city. Thus the user may be fully immersed within the experience or content of the virtual simulation by being able to interact with the augmented reality application. The same experience may be achieved with for example multiple games that are immersed within different levels. For instance one level of immersion may have the user and the device within a zero gravity world based on certain content e.g. a video game virtual world etc. . The second level of immersion may have a computer game that responds as if being played in the zero gravity world in response to the first level of immersion. Further the various levels of immersion may be oblivious to each other by the immersion service executing the immersion levels independently.

By way of another example the devices that are immersed within the content may be thought of as more than an everyday device but can be considered a device that a user uses on a daily basis to gain extra sensory perception of their surrounding environment or extend their senses. The system allows content to interact with these devices and distort the extra senses that these devices provide to the user to immerse the user in a virtual world. The system further allows for multiple levels of immersion to even further augment and or distort senses of the user received through the devices. By way of example a user may be playing a video game on their device. The video game may be related to for instance a flight simulation. Within the video game the user may be traveling at a high rate of speed e.g. Mach 1 . If the user executes a second application such as another game the system may execute the second application as if the second application is executed within the virtual world created by the first application. Thus the extra senses gained by the second application may be relative to the conditions or immersion caused by the first application. For example the second application may detect that the user and or the device is traveling at a high rate of speed as if the user and or device are being put in high gravitational force conditions. Thus the system allows for nested immersion experiences. Accordingly as discussed below each immersion experience can be a standalone immersion experience or be a nested immersion experience in one or more immersion experiences. For instance reality may be considered as dimension and an immersive reality may be considered as dimension through dimension N where N represents the number of nested immersion experiences.

Further where the system provides for nested a immersion experience by combining immersion experiences the system provides for the ability for the immersion experiences to interact using the normal communication and or interfacing channels. Thus an immersed state can be provided to third party applications through the normal platform interfaces. By way of example where location is involved in immersion experiences the third party application may receive location information although constituting immersed location information from the regular platform that provides location information in an immersed device such as for example the GPS. Thus because the third party applications receive immersion information from the normal platforms associated with the information the third party applications may be unaware of the immersion experience.

By way of another example a user may be using their mobile phone to present content such as watching a movie on their mobile phone. The presentation of the movie on the mobile phone may otherwise not normally interface or use other components of the phone such as the ringer. However the system provides the ability to detect of one or more immersive interaction events within the presentation of the movie and to interface with the ringer on the mobile phone such that for example when a mobile phone rings within the movie the ringer of the actual mobile phone used to present the movie also rings. The ringer may ring by the system determining the one or more immersive interaction events within the content determining one or more controls signals associated immersive interaction event and the ringer within the mobile phone and executing the one or more control signals upon the ringing in the presentation of the movie.

The system allows for the configuration of any type of device that is compatible with or one or more controls signals and or protocols used to transmit the control signals. The system further allows for the association with any number of devices that may or may not be associated with control signals specific to specific content. Thus although a user may know the devices that are compatible with one or more controls signals and or protocols the user is unaware of the immersive interaction events within the content and the specific devices that the system will interact with. The resulting surprise effect adds to the realism of the presentation of the content and aids in immersing the user into the content. Further different environments may be associated with different devices. Thus the experience realized in one environment may be different than the experience realized in a different environment based on the different associated devices. For instance a user that brings a movie to a friends house which is associated with different devices than the user s house will experience a different immersion associated with the content based on the different devices. Under this approach the system allows for non standardized experiences associated with the content. Thus unlike certain movie theaters that provide a standardized experience associated with for example a three dimensional movie in addition to extra sensory feedback e.g. tactile feedback the system allows for non standardized experiences that may vary based on the number and type of devices that are associated by way of the system with the presentation of the content.

Further the same type of devices with different feature may provide different immersion experiences. For example an advanced mobile phone may have many features that content may interact with to immerse the user of the advanced mobile phone into the content. A less advanced mobile phone may have a limited number of extra features or no extra features that prevent the less advanced mobile phone from becoming fully immersed into the content. For instance an advanced mobile phone may include location determination functionality e.g. GPS while the less advanced mobile phone may not. Accordingly the advanced mobile phone can display its location while the less advanced mobile phone cannot Thus the advanced mobile phone can immerse the user within the content in part by displaying a virtual location of the user and the advanced mobile phone. However the less advanced mobile phone cannot immerse the user within the content by displaying a virtual location. Thus different types of devices e.g. mobile phone dishwasher microwave oven light switch etc. can provide different immersion experiences as well as different devices within the same type of device e.g. different mobile phones with different functionality etc. can similarly provide different immersion experiences based on the features the different devices within the same type of device support.

The system further enables the ability to insert one or more representations of one the content into the device one or more other devices or a combination thereof. The one or more devices may then be used to interact with the content. The one or more devices may be associated personally with a user. Thus the interactions between the content and the devices immerse the user in the content. Further the system enables to ability to augment the experiences associated with a user s device that is otherwise unrelated to the presentation of content or one or more components of a device that are otherwise unrelated to the presentation of the content to immerse the user in a presentation of the content. The immersion may be based at least in part on the combination of information associated with the content with information that is native to the user s device. Such native information may be information that was present on the device prior to the device being associated with the content by the system . Such a combination makes the user unable to perceive what information on the device is native to the device and what information is based on the content to further immerse the user in the content. The system further allows for the ability to interact with a virtual environment created by the content using the user s existing device that may otherwise be unrelated to the presentation of the content. Such interactions may be based on the same functions associated with the device based on interactions the user would perform in the real world yet the functions instead interact with a virtual world created by the content. Such an enablement allows the user to bring the content into their devices to enhance a psychological immersion experience of the user within the content. In one embodiment the system allows for content to query information from the immersed devices e.g. the everyday device to further the immersion experience. The queried information obtained from the immersed devices may then be used and or incorporated into the content. By way of example an immersed device may include an ambient light sensor. The system allows for the content to query the device for the value of the ambient light. Based on this information the system allows for an augmentation of the content based on the ambient light value from the immersed device. For instance a virtual world skyline could be created to match the light coming through the window at the location the user is viewing the content which is based on the value obtained from the ambient light sensor. By providing the ability for content to obtain information from the immersed devices the system further allows for the immersion of a user into content according to the characteristics of the surroundings of the user.

As shown in the system comprises user equipment UE collectively referred to as UE having connectivity to an immersion service via a communication network . By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network a wireless network a telephony network or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth near field communication NFC Internet Protocol IP data casting digital radio television broadcasting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UE is any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device mobile communication device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

The UE may include one or more applications collectively referred to as applications . The applications may be any type of application such as one or more gaming applications one or more multimedia applications e.g. movie player music player etc. and the like. In one embodiment an application may interface with the immersion service for associating the UE with the presentation of content. The application may also interact with the immersion service to effectuate one or more events between the content and the UE as discussed in detail below. Thus in one embodiment the UE may act as one or more devices immersed within the content. The UE may also act as one or more devices that present the content.

The system may also include a host device that has connectivity to the UE and the immersion service through the communication network . Although illustrated as one device in the system may include one or more host devices . In one embodiment the host device has connectivity directly to the UE through one or more wired and or wireless connections. The host device may be associated with presenting the content to the user. By way of example the host device may be a DVD player that plays a movie a gaming console that plays a game etc. The host device may also include a combination of devices that are used for presenting content to a user. For example the host devices may be a DVD player in combination with a television and stereo equipment for presenting both visual and audio content to the user. In one embodiment the host device may be a UE that is used to present content to a user. For example the UE may be presenting content such as a game or a movie and one or more other devices within the system may be immersed within the content. In one embodiment the host device may present streamed content that is streamed from for example one or more services and or content providers discussed below. By way of example the content may be presented as streamed content using the Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld DVB H format. The host device may present the streamed content signal and the UE may be immersed into the streamed content. In one example the streamed content may be presented as content broadcasted on a real world broadcasting channel or station e.g. TV radio internet radio . Further in one embodiment the content that a UE and or user is immersed into may further cause other content to be streamed to the immersed UE . By way of example where the content in which a UE is immersed into is a massively multiplayer online role playing game MMORPG the content may cause other content such as television programming broadcasted on a real world broadcasting channel to be streamed to the immersed UE Thus a user of the UE may be immersed in an immersion experience created by the content e.g. the MMORPG but be experiencing real world content e.g. the television programming through the immersed UE . In such an embodiment the user is effectively experiencing immersed real world content.

The system may also include one or more immersed devices collectively referred to as immersed devices that have connectivity to the UE the immersion service and the host device through the communication network . In one embodiment the immersed devices may be directly connected to the host device through one or more wired and or wireless connections. The immersed devices may be any type of device that can interact with the host device the UE and the immersion service . By way of example the immersed devices may be a light light switch a washing machine a fan a microwave oven a wrist watch a refrigerator a dishwasher etc. The immersed devices may interact with the host device the immersion service and the UE via any type of protocol such as Bluetooth WLAN radio etc. or any other protocol described herein with respect to for example the communication network . In one embodiment the UE may represent an immersed device by way of the UE being immersed within the presentation of content. Thus the UE may in one embodiment represent a specific type of immersed device . In one embodiment the UE or any immersed device may also represent the host device . By way of example a UE may present content such as a movie and thus correspond to a host device. The UE may also be immersed within the content based on immersive interaction events determined by the system within the content. For example one or more components associated with the UE may be associated with presenting the content. One or more other components associated with the UE may otherwise not be related to presenting the content but may be controlled based generally on the content such as the ringer of a mobile phone being controlled by one or more control signals based on one or more immersive interaction events within the content.

In one embodiment one or more representations of content may be combined with one or more immersed devices such that the content may be inserted into the devices. Accordingly the one or more immersed devices may interact with the content by receiving information from the content and sending one or more responses back to the content through one or more user interactions with the content. By way of example an immersed device may be a washing machine. The content may include one or more immersive interaction events associated with the washing machine. Based on the one or more control signals determined based on the immersive interaction events within the content the washing machine may respond with one or more responses that interact with the content such as when the content is an instructional video that interacts with one or more actions at the washing machine.

The UE may also have connectivity to a services platform through the communication network . The services platform may include one or more services collectively referred to as services . The services platform may provide one or more services to the UE the immersion service the content providers and the host device . The services may be associated with gaming services multimedia services social networking services etc. In one embodiment one or more services may be associated with one or more functions associated with the immersion service .

The UE may also have connectivity to one or more content providers collectively referred to as content providers through the communication network . The content providers may provide content to the UE the immersion service the services of the services platform and the host device . The content may be any type of content such as content associated with the presentation of content to a user from a host device to an immersed device and or UE .

The immersion service may enable the control over one or more devices associated with a user based on the determination of one or more immersive interaction events associated with content presented to the user. Although illustrated as a separate component of the system in the immersion service and or any one or more of the functions of the immersion service may be embodied in one or more of the elements of the system . By way of example in one embodiment the immersion service may be embodied in a host device that executes the presentation of content. In one embodiment the immersion service may be embodied in one or more immersed devices including one or more UE and or in one or more services . However the immersion service may also be a distinct element of the system that interacts with any of the other elements of the system .

The immersion service enables content to interact with an environment associated with a user. The immersion service processes content presented at a device to determine one or more immersive interaction events. The device that presents the content may be for example a host device and or a UE that act as for example a movie player an audio player etc. The one or more other devices may include one or more UE including the UE presenting the content and or one or more immersed devices . The content may include for example one or more movies one or more videos one or more television programs one or more songs one or more games etc. The immersion service further determines a one or more control signals for controlling the device and or one or more other devices to cause the one or more immersive interaction events and or b one or more protocols for transmitting the one or more control signals. As discussed above the protocols may be for example Bluetooth WLAN radio or any other protocol discussed herein. The immersion service further causes a transmission of the control signals to the device and or the one or more other devices to immerse the devices within the presentation of the content. The control over the devices causes the users that are associated with the devices to become immersed in the presented content thereby attaining a more realistic experience. The immersion service includes one or more application programming interfaces API for associating one or more actions one or more functions and or one or more characteristics in the content presented by the device with the device and or the one or more other devices. The API of the immersion service further allows the content to initiate one or more events on the device and or the one or more other devices as well as listen and receive responses to the events from the device and or the one or more other devices.

The immersion service determines the supported control signals the supported protocols or a combination thereof between a device that presents content e.g. a host device and the device itself e.g. one or more other components on the device and or one or more other devices that may be controlled based on the content e.g. the UE the immersed devices . The immersion service may perform such a determination when initially associated with an environment upon receiving information associated with a presentation of content periodically regardless of receiving information associated with a presentation of content on demand or a combination thereof. Upon determining the control signals and protocols associated with the host device and the immersed devices the immersion service may configure any environment for a more personalized experience.

The immersion service further determines virtual devices represented within the presentation of the content. The one or more virtual devices correspond to the UE and or the immersed devices in the real world. By way of example the content may be associated with a movie and a scene during the movie may have lights turn on. Thus the lights or a light switch associated with the lights represents a virtual device associated with the content. The content may include one or more actions functions and or characteristics associated with the virtual devices. The immersion service may cause a synchronization of the actions the functions the characteristics or a combination thereof of the one or more virtual devices with an execution of one or more control signals at the device and or the one or more other devices such that the virtual devices in the content are synchronized with the immersed devices e.g. immersed devices and or UE in the real world.

In one embodiment a device immersed within the content may have the content inserted into the device. The immersion service may control the insertion of the content into the device. The device may then be used to interact with the content. The immersion service may then determine one or more interactions the content and the one or more devices. The interactions allow the content to interact with the device and allow the device to interact with the content by responding to one or more immersive interaction events within the content. The immersion service may process the one or more interactions.

In one embodiment the immersion service may cause a combination of data from the content with data native to the one or more devices such that the data from the content is indistinguishable from data native to the devices. Under this approach a user cannot tell what is real e.g. native to the device and what is virtual e.g. data from the content . Thus the user is fully immersed into the content using the user s own everyday device. By way of example data from the content is displayed alongside data native to the device within the user interface of the device. Accordingly when the user views the user interfaces such as a contacts user interface the user cannot tell what contacts are native to the device and therefore native to the real world and what contacts are native to the content and therefore native to the virtual world associated with the content.

In one embodiment the immersion service may further cause a generation of one or more user interfaces at the immersed devices for presenting information generated by the content the one or more engines generating the content or a combination thereof based on the controls signals. The immersion service by causing a generation of the user interfaces may reproduce the user interfaces normally experienced with the devices such that the interactions between the user and the device based on the generated user interfaces are indistinguishable from interactions between the user and user interfaces native to the device. In other words the user is unable to determine whether the user is interacting with information pertaining to the real world on the device or information pertaining to the virtual world associated with content. This achieves a psychological immersion associated with the content and makes the immersion personalized to the user by using the user s own device.

In one embodiment an immersed device may request information from the content based on one or more immersive interaction events and or responses to one or more immersive interaction events. By way of example an immersed device may send a message to the host device presenting the content to request information to augment within the user interface of the immersed device . The requested information may then be transmitted to the immersed device and be displayed on a user interface associated with the immersed device . When the association between an immersed device and the content ends any augmentation of the immersed device may end such that the device returns to its original state before the association. By way of example where the content is a movie played by a DVD player when the movie stops the association between the DVD player and the immersed device may end which may result in the augmentation of the immersed device ending. Accordingly any information that the immersed device may have retrieved or had access to from the content may be lost such that the augmentation is ended. In one embodiment although the connection between a host device and for example an immersed device may end the immersion service may still be in communication with the immersed device to cause the immersed device to end the augmentation of the information within the immersed device

In one embodiment the immersive interaction events and or control signals sent to the device and or the one or more other devices may be associated with the content in such a way as to generate advertisements related to the content. By way of example where the content represents a movie one or more product placements associated with the movie may be associated with one or more commands directed to one or more devices. For example a device that may be controlled by the immersion service based on the content may be a refrigerator. Thus when a product is presented in the movie such as when a beverage brand is included in the movie the beverage brand may automatically have their product associated with the refrigerator such as having the product placed in an electronic shopping list associated with the refrigerator.

By way of example the UE the immersion service the services platform the content providers the host device and the immersed device communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

The device module determines the devices associated with a presentation of content. The device module determines the one or more host devices that present content to a user. In one embodiment as discussed above the immersion service may be embodied in the host device . In which case the device module does not need to determine the host device associated with presenting content to a user. The device module also determines one or more other devices that may be controlled by the host device such as one or more UE the host device itself and or one or more immersed devices . The device module may determine the one or more other devices via any method for detecting devices. By way of example the device module may determine the one or more supported protocols and or supported control signals between the host device and the one or more other devices to determine the associated devices. Thus the method for determining the devices may be based on the one or more protocols used for transmitting information between the devices.

The API module provides the link between the host device and one or more other devices that are controlled by the host device based on the immersive interaction events within the content. The API module provides interfaces to the host device the content presented on the host device one or more engines generating the content or a combination thereof for performing one or more interactions between the host device and the one or more other devices. In one embodiment the API module may provide interfaces to the various components of the host device presenting the content such that the content may access one or more other components of the host device to control based on the commands in the content. The API module interfaces with the host device for performing transactions on the one or more devices as well as providing interfaces for listening for and receiving responses from the one or more devices. In one embodiment the API module interfaces with one or more applications located on the UE when one or more of the UE are controlled by the content. The one or more applications on the UE similarly receive and send information pertaining to the UE to the immersion service via the API module . The applications may initiate one or more actions one or more functions one or more characteristics or a combination thereof associated with commands from the content at the UE . The applications may also receive one or more responses to commands from one or more other applications at the UE in response to the commands. The applications also may track the one or more transactions between the content and the other devices to determine what controls performed at the other devices relate to the content and what controls performed at the devices relate to native controls and or native information. In which case the applications may determine whether the other devices should respond to the controls based on the native responses of the devices or based on the responses according to the content.

The event module processes the content presented to a user to determine one or more immersive interaction events associated with the content. The event module further correlates the one or more immersive interaction events to one or more control signals and or one or more protocols associated with transmitting the control signals to one or more other devices or one or more components of the immersed device. In one embodiment the event module synchronizes one or more actions one or more functions one or more characteristics or a combination thereof associated with one or more virtual devices with an execution of the control signal at one or more immersed devices associated with the immersion service based on the content. The event module performs the synchronization such that the virtual device and the one or more immersed devices are synchronized thereby making the action the function and or the characteristic of the virtual device and the real device occur at the same time. The synchronization therefore causes the perception to the user that the user s device is immersed within the content and therefore immerses the user in the content.

The information module performs the functions of transmitting and tracking information that is passed to one or more devices when one or more devices are immersed within the content and or when one or more representations of the content are immersed within the devices. As discussed above information associated with the content may be combined with information that is native to one or more immersed devices . Accordingly the information module tracks the information that is transmitted between the one or more immersed devices and the host device presenting the content and or the immersion service . In one embodiment the information module transmits information to the one or more devices controlled by the immersion service as the devices request the information. In one embodiment the information module transmits all of the information in one transmission such that the device has all of the information needed to immerse the device in the virtual world associated with the content as discussed in detail below.

In one embodiment upon dissociation between the immersed device and a host device the immersed device no longer is able to communicate with the host device presenting the content. Accordingly the pathways used by the immersed device to retrieve information from the content no longer exist. Thus the augmentation of the immersed device with virtual information from the content combined with native information to the device ends and the immersed device no longer presents the virtual information. In one embodiment the immersion service may issue one or more commands to the one or more devices to delete the transmitted information. In such an embodiment although a connection between a host device and a controlled device may be lost the connection between the immersed device and the immersion service may remain such that the immersion service may continue transmitting commands to the immersed device.

In one embodiment the user interface module causes a combination information from the virtual environment of the content presented by the host device with the native information of the immersed device . The user interface module may cause the combination of information by for example interfacing with one or more applications associated with the immersed device that generate the user interfaces at the immersed device

In step the immersion service processes content presented at a device to determine one or more immersive interaction events. The content can represent any type of content such as movies videos music television programs etc. The device that presents the content may be considered a host device . By way of example a movie may be played by a DVD player and the DVD player may be considered the host device . The movie may include one or more interactive immersive events associated with immersing one or more devices into the content. In one embodiment the DVD player may process the information related to the movie to extract the information pertaining to the immersive interaction events within the information associated with the movie. In such an embodiment the immersion service may be embodied in the DVD player. In one embodiment the information pertaining to the movie may be transmitted over the communication network to the immersion service which may then process the information associated with the movie to determine the one or more immersive interaction events. The immersive interaction events may be for immersing one or more devices into the content. The one or more devices may be any device that may be controlled by the content based on the one or more control signals. By way of example the one or more devices may be the UE and or the immersed devices or even the host device where one or more other components are controlled by the commands. By way of specific examples the one or more immersed devices may be a microwave oven a dishwasher a washing machine a refrigerator a light switch a wrist watch a computer a UE or any device that is able to communicate with the immersion service and or the host device via one or more protocols e.g. Bluetooth .

In step the immersion service determines a one or more control signals for controlling the device one or more other devices or a combination thereof to cause at least in part the one or more immersive interaction events b one or more protocols for transmitting the one or more control signals or c a combination thereof. The one or more controls signals may represent the one or more signals that are associated with the one or more devices that are controlled that effectuate the immersion of the one or more devices within the content. The one or more protocols are the protocols that are used to exchange the information pertaining to the one or more control signals at the one or more controlled devices. Based on this step for example the immersion service is able to process the content presented by the host device and determine one or more control signals that may be transmitted to one or more devices that are associated with the immersion service for providing a more personalized experience when presenting the content. Because the immersion service is able to determine the control signals and or the protocols that the immersion service is able to interface with real world devices that may otherwise be unrelated to presenting the content and interface with these devices so that the devices present some type of information whether audio visual tactile or a combination thereof related to the content to immerse the user associated with the devices into the content. Accordingly a user does not need to obtain specialty equipment or travel to a service provider e.g. movie theater to be presented with a personalized experience that immerses the user in the content. Rather the immersion service may simply use the everyday devices within the environment of the user to immerse the devices and the user into the presented content.

In step the immersion service causes at least in part a transmission of the one or more control signals to the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof. By transmitting the one or more control signals to the device e.g. various other components of the device presenting the content that may for example otherwise be unrelated to presenting the content or the one or more other devices the immersion service immerses the one or more devices into the content to immerse the user associated with the presentation of the content into the content.

In step the immersion service causes at least in part a querying of the one or more other devices the device or a combination thereof for one or more capabilities one or more supported control signals one or more supported protocols or a combination thereof. The immersion service causes the querying to determine the environment associated with the device that presents the content and one or more other devices that may be controlled by the content. In one embodiment the immersion service may cause the querying once during an initial setup of the immersion service with respect to a device presenting the content e.g. host device . Thus for example upon the immersion service detecting a new host device the immersion service may cause a query for supported control signals and or supported protocols. In one embodiment the immersion service may cause the querying once upon the initial playback of content. Thus for example upon a host device presenting specific content for the first time such as the first time the host device plays a specific movie the immersion service may cause a querying for supported control signals and or supported protocols. In one embodiment the immersion service may cause the querying continuously regardless of whether content is being presented or not to determine the supported control signals and or supported protocols and any changes to the supported control signals and or supported protocols that may occur over time. In one embodiment the immersion service may cause the querying upon command such as from a host device from one or more other devices e.g. UE and or immersed devices or based on one or more services .

By causing the querying for supported control signals and supported protocols the immersion service may be constantly aware of the capabilities of the host device and the one or more other devices to determine what immersive interaction events associated with the content are supported by the host device and the one or more other devices. Thus in step the immersion service determines the one or more controls signals the one or more protocols or a combination thereof used to control the one or more other devices according to the content based at least in part on the one or more supported control signals the one or more supported protocols or a combination thereof. Accordingly the immersion service can determine the immersive interaction events that are associated with the content that are supported by the host device and the one or more other devices. If no devices are present that are supported by the immersive interaction events within the content the immersion service allows for the presentation of the content without immersing any device. If there are a large number of devices that may be controlled based on the supported control signals and the supported protocols the immersion service controls the devices based on the immersive interaction events in the content.

In step the immersion service determines one or more virtual devices presented in the content and cause at least in part a simulation of one or more actions one or more functions one or more characteristics or a combination thereof associated with the one or more virtual devices at the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof based at least in part on the one or more control signals. The one or more virtual devices may correspond to any of the devices that are associated with the immersion service . However the virtual devices are virtual because they exist in the content. By way of example a movie may include a scene associated with a light switch such as where a character in the movie turns off lights using the light switch. Accordingly the virtual device is the virtual light switch in the movie. The virtual devices may correspond to one or more devices controlled by the immersion service . For example a light switch associated with the real world may be able to communicate with the immersion service based on a supported control signal and or a supported protocol. The immersion service will make an association between the virtual light switch and the real world light switch such that when the movie comes to a point where there is a action function or characteristic associated with the virtual light switch the immersion service causes the real world light switch to simulate the action function and or characteristic associated with the virtual light switch. Accordingly the user associated with the presentation of the content such as the movie is immersed in the content by having a light switch associated with the real world simulate events associated with the virtual light switch in the movie. By way of example during a horror movie where a villain turns of the lights the immersion service may turn off the lights in the real world associated with the user based on commands in the content and the association of the virtual lights and the real world lights.

In step the immersion service causes at least in part a synchronization of the one or more actions the one or more functions the one or more characteristics or a combination thereof of the one or more virtual devices with an execution of the one or more control signals at the device e.g. at the one or more other components of the device that are now controlled by the commands the one or more other devices or a combination thereof e.g. the UE and or the immersed devices or a combination thereof. The immersion service causes the synchronization such that the user perceives the action the function and or the characteristic associated with the virtual device and the controlled device at the same time so that the user for example feels as if they are part of the content rather than simply viewing the content.

In one embodiment the interaction between the content and one or more controlled devices may be more involved than merely causing an action function and or characteristic associated with a virtual device occur at the same time as a real device. The interaction may involve multiple interactions that cause content to become immersed in the device such that the user can for example interact with the content through the device. is a flowchart of a process for inserting content into the one or more devices according to one embodiment. In one embodiment the immersion service performs the process and is implemented in for instance a chip set including a processor and a memory as shown in .

In step the immersion service causes at least in part an insertion of one or more representations of the content into the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof. The insertion causes the content to be inserted into the one or more devices to become associated with the content such that the devices are able to interact with the content. By way of example content may be inserted into the UE based on the immersion service . Accordingly the functions that may be normally be performed by the UE such as receiving communications e.g. phone calls text messages multimedia messages emails etc. may now be performed associated with the content or the real world. For instance the user may still receive telephone calls from users not associated with the content. However the user may also receive telephone calls from one or more virtual characters associated with the content. In such a case if the content is associated with a game executed by a gaming console as the host device the user may now receive phone calls from one or more non players characters associated with the game content.

To effectuate the above in step the immersion service determines one or more interactions between the one or more representations of the content and the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof. The one or more interactions may be associated with the immersive interaction events initiating actions functions and or characteristics associated with the one or more controlled devices. The one or more interactions may also be associated with the host device receiving interactive responses to the initiated actions functions and or characteristics from the one or more controlled devices or the host device itself when one or more components of the host device are controlled . The transactions may also be associated with the one or more controlled devices initiating actions functions and or characteristics associated with the one or more controlled devices associated with the content and or one or more engines generating the content. Thus the host device and the one or more controlled devices may exchange information associated with immersing a user into content presented to the user to develop a more personalized experience for the user. In step the immersion service processes the one or more interactions associated with the content immersed within the devices in a symbiotic relationship to determine the immersive interaction events. The determined immersive interaction events may then be used to determine one or more additional control signals that may be used for interactions between the immersed device and the host device.

By way of example where the host device is associated with a gaming console executing a game and one or the one or more other devices is a UE the interactions between the one or more representations of the content and the device allow for phone calls and or text messages between the virtual game world and the real word such as between one or more non player characters associated with the game and the user associated with the UE navigating through the virtual world using one or more navigation applications on the UE browsing information associated with the content through a virtual Internet associated with the content looking up non player characters in a contacts application on the UE associating calendar applications on the UE with one or more events associated with the virtual world in the game associating lists of activities to perform on the UE with one or more activities associated with the virtual world in the game and or making notes specific to the virtual world in the game. Accordingly based on the process a user may use a device that has functionality beyond merely presenting content to interact with the content. By using a device that a user may already have that is not necessarily associated with the presentation of the content the user may achieve a personalized experience with the content without having to purchase specialty equipment. Also by interacting with a device such as a UE that the user may interact with on a daily basis the user perceives even more of an immersion into the content.

In step the immersion service causes at least in part a combination of virtual information associated with the content with native information associated with the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof at one or more user interfaces associated with the device the one or more other devices or a combination thereof based at least in part on the one or more immersive interaction events. The content may include one or more immersive interaction events that cause the immersion service to transmit information to the immersed device associated with virtual information from the content. In response the immersed device may present the information on one or more user interfaces associated with the device as if the transmitted information is information native to the device rather than from the content. By way of example virtual information associated with one or more contacts may be transmitted to the immersed device based on an immersive interaction event associated with the content. The transmitted content may then be presented in the user interfaces associated with the device. Thus when the user of the immersed device opens an application that displays contacts for example one or more of the contacts may be virtual contacts from the content. In one embodiment an immersive interaction event may instead for example interact with the immersed device such that information is not transmitted to the immersed device until the device performs an action. For example when a user of the immersed device opens an application associated with displaying contacts the immersed device determines that an application is being started that will include information from the content. The immersed device therefore may then request virtual information from the host device presenting the content and or from the immersion service . Upon receiving the virtual information the immersed device may display the information within the user interface associated with the application for presenting the contacts. Where the device and or the one or more other devices is a UE the native information may represent for example contacts in a contacts application bookmarks in a browser application calendar events in a calendar application or any other information that may be found on a UE . The virtual information may similarly be one or more contacts one or more bookmarks one or more calendar events etc. that are all associated with the virtual world associated with content.

The information may be transmitted to the device and or the one or more other devices as needed the information may be transmitted to the device and or the one or more other devices upon an representation of the device being associated with the content or a combination thereof. By way of example the immersion service may detect an execution of a contacts application on a UE based on one or more notifications received from the UE in response to the execution of the contacts application. The immersion service may request basic information regarding the contacts associated with the content from the host device . The basic information may include for example only a name and or a picture that may be viewed within a top menu of the contacts application. The host device may then pass the contacts information to the immersion service which may then pass the contacts information to the UE . The contacts application at the UE may then augment native data at the UE with the information provided from the content to combine the virtual contacts information with the native contacts information. When the user of the UE views contacts as provided by the contacts applications the contacts will include native contacts associated with the real world and one or more virtual contacts associated with the content. Accordingly the user interface associated with the contacts will look identical to the user interface associated with the native contacts application of the UE such that the user is unable to determine what contacts are native contacts and what contacts are virtual contacts. Alternatively the UE e.g. the immersed device may detect the execution of an application that may request information associated with the content. The UE may then request the information that will be used by the application from the immersion service and or the host device to be displayed on the user interface of the UE . The requested information may then augment the information already on the UE that is associated with the application By way of another example all of the information pertaining to the virtual contacts or any other information associated with the content may be transmitted to the UE upon the contacts application initially being executed at the UE . By way of another example all of the information pertaining to the virtual world associated with the content may be transmitted to the UE upon an association between the UE and a host device associated with presenting the content.

As one alternative embodiment the immersion service may override native user interfaces on the one or more immersed devices with one or more user interfaces generated by the immersion service that look identical to the native user interfaces. In one embodiment the immersion service may merge user interfaces to merge the native information and the information from the content. If the user selects one of the virtual contacts for additional information a routing of information may occur such that the immersion service requests the specific information associated with the virtual contact from the content and the specific information is passed to the UE

In step the immersion service causes at least in part a modification of the content an interaction with the content or a combination thereof based at least in part on the one or more interactions the one to more immersive interaction events or a combination thereof. Such interactions may be for example responses associated with interactions involving phone calls and or text messages between a virtual game world and the real word such as between one or more non player characters associated with the game and the user associated with the UE navigating through the virtual world using one or more navigation applications on the UE browsing information associated with the content through a virtual Internet associated with the content looking up non player characters in a contacts application on the UE associating calendar applications on the UE with one or more events associated with the virtual world in the game associating lists of activities to perform on the UE with one or more activities associated with the virtual world in the game and or making notes specific to the virtual world in the game as discussed above.

By way of example a user may be viewing a movie presented by a DVD player acting as a host device. The DVD player may be controlling a mobile phone while presenting the content. A scene in the movie may include a virtual character directing the user to call a friend and tell the friend that the friendship is over. The scene may correspond with one or more commands that direct the mobile phone to listen for or detect one or more phone calls to a friend listed as a contact in the mobile phone. If the user uses the mobile phone to call the friend and performs the actions requested by the virtual character the mobile phone may then respond to the DVD player with one or more responses indicating that the call was performed. In which case the virtual character may respond based on the one or more responses from the mobile phone indicating the virtual character s approval of the user. If the user does not perform the action requested by the virtual character the virtual character may respond differently such as disparaging the user for not listening to instructions. Accordingly the user is immersed in the content by being able to directly interact with the content. Because the user is using a device not otherwise associated with the presentation of the content e.g. the mobile phone the user feels even more immersed in the content.

As illustrated in a UE may be associated with a user interface of a calendar application that as illustrated in the exploded view of user interface includes appointments and . As discussed above the UE may also be associated with content presented on another device e.g. host device such that information from the content may be presented on the UE . By way of example appointments and may be native appointments associated with the UE prior to the UE becoming associated with the content. However appointment may be associated with a virtual appointment from the content such as an appointment with a non player character in a game. As illustrated in the exploded view the various appointments and are formatted identically and are indistinguishable except for the information they present. Thus for example there is no way for a user of the UE to determine that the appointment is associated with a virtual character from the content based on the user interface . The seamless integration of the appointment with the appointments and immerses the user of the UE into the content.

As illustrated in a UE may be associated with a user interface of a messaging application that as illustrated in the exploded view of user interface includes messages and . As discussed above the UE may also be associated with content presented on another device e.g. host device such that information from the content may be presented on the UE . By way of example messages and may be native messages associated with the UE prior to the UE becoming associated with the content. However message may be associated with a virtual message from within the content such as a message from a non player character in a game. As illustrated in the exploded view the various messages and are formatted identically and are indistinguishable except for the information they present. Thus for example there is no way for a user of the UE to determine that the message is associated with a virtual character from the content based on the user interface . The seamless integration of the message with the messages and immerses the user of the UE into the content.

As illustrated in a UE may be associated with a user interface of a telephone application that as illustrated in the exploded view of user interface an incoming call from Bradley Murphy. In one embodiment Bradley Murphy may correspond to a virtual character included within the content. However a transaction between the content and the UE results in the user interface corresponding to a virtual call from the virtual character Bradley Murphy. Because the application looks identical as the application would look if the UE was receiving a call from a real person and not a virtual character there is no way for a user of the UE to determine that the user interface is associated with a virtual character from the content based. The seamless integration of the user interface with within the UE immerses the user of the UE into the content.

As illustrated in a UE may be associated with a user interface of a communications application that as illustrated in the exploded view of user interface includes missed calls and . As discussed above the UE may also be associated with content presented on another device e.g. host device such that information from the content may be presented on the UE . By way of example missed calls and may be native missed calls associated with the UE prior to the UE becoming associated with the content. However missed call may be associated with a virtual character from within the content such as a missed call from a non player character in a game. As illustrated in the exploded view the various messages and are formatted identically and are indistinguishable except for the information they present. Thus for example there is no way for a user of the UE to determine that the missed call is associated with a virtual character from the content based on the user interface . The seamless integration of the missed call with the missed calls and immerses the user of the UE into the content.

As illustrated in the UE may be associated with a user interface which is illustrated in the exploded view that me be associated with a navigation application . The navigation application may be a native application on the UE but currently displaying information associated with content presented from a host device. Thus the user interface may allow a user to navigate through a virtual world using the UE that is otherwise unrelated to presenting the content to the user.

As illustrated in one example of an immersed device may be a microwave oven . The microwave oven may include a user interface that based on one or more immersive interaction events associated with the presentation of content may present a message associated with the content such as TIME FOR POPCORN As an example such a message may be based on the beginning of the playback of a movie associated with a host device. Further illustrates another example of an immersed device such as a refrigerator . The refrigerator may include a user interface that based on one or more immersive interaction events associated with content presented by a host device that has interfaced with the refrigerator may display a message associated with an event within the content. For example the content may be a movie that includes a character that may enjoy a drink at some point during the movie. The drink may be G s Soda Pop. At the time the character enjoys the drink a control signal may be sent to the refrigerator to add G s Soda Pop to a grocery list e.g. Morn s Shopping List . In which the control signal may be a form of advertising that is included in the content.

As illustrated in an immersed device such as a washing machine dryer combination may have a representation inserted into the content to have the content control the washing machine dryer combination . By way of example the content may represent an instructional video for describing how to use the washing machine dryer combination . The content may include a scene describing how to set the wash temperature for the washing machine. The scene may include a control signal that is issued to the washing machine to prompt the user to enter for example a wash temperature as illustrated by indicator . Once the user sets a wash temperature the washing machine may issue a response to the control signal that corresponds to for example a response indicating that the wash temperature was set. Upon a host device that is presenting the content receiving the response the content may be advanced to the next scene that describes for example how to set the water level. The scene may include a control signal that is issued to the washing machine to prompt the user to for example enter a water level associated with a wash as illustrated by indicator . Once the user sets a water level the washing machine may issue a response to the control signal prompting the user to enter a water level that corresponds to for example a response indicating that the water level was set.

The signals transmitted over network link and other networks through communications interface carry information to and from computer system . Computer system can send and receive information including program code through the networks among others through network link and communications interface . In an example using the Internet a server host transmits program code for a particular application requested by a message sent from computer through Internet ISP equipment local network and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor as it is received or may be stored in memory or in storage device or any other non volatile storage for later execution or both. In this manner computer system may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA one or more controllers or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing immersive interaction via everyday devices based on one or more immersive interaction events. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to provide immersive interaction via everyday devices based on one or more immersive interaction events. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device may be but not limited to a single memory CD DVD ROM RAM EEPROM optical storage magnetic disk storage flash memory storage or any other non volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.

An optionally incorporated SIM card carries for instance important information such as the cellular phone number the carrier supplying service subscription details and security information. The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile terminal settings.
