title: Interface for sharing posts about a live online event among users of a social networking system
abstract: An external system (e.g., a website) is associated with an event and includes an interface that allows users to interact with streams of content associated with a social networking system. The interface allows a user to provide posts about the event via the interface, where the posts are displayed in the interface and also in a social networking interface on social networking system in connection with the user and other users associated with that user. The user can view, via the interface on the external system, posts from all users that are provided via the interface (e.g., everyone watching the event), thereby increasing the likelihood that the posts are relevant to the event. The user can also view, via the interface, posts from users associated with the user via the social networking system (e.g., friends of the user), regardless of where those are posted.

The present application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 646 838 filed on Dec. 23 2009 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 997 006 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to media presentation and more particularly to an interface for sharing posts about a live online event among users of a social networking system.

Social networking systems include social utilities that track and enable connections between users including people businesses and other entities . In particular social networking systems allow users to communicate information more efficiently and to associate themselves with other users thus creating a web of connections among the users of the social networking system. Users commonly share information with one another via the social networking system. A user can post text and content e.g. photos videos music links or any other type of digital or other content that can be posted on the Internet or a combination of both and can post comments relating to other users and their posts. These types of user posts or news stories can be displayed to users in a feed or stream of content either on a social networking website or elsewhere .

Posts and related comments by users sharing information on the social networking system sometimes tend toward particular topics or current events. When a noteworthy event has occurred or is in progress many of the posts on the social networking system will be directed toward this event or related topics. A user interested in this event may be interested in reading the posts of other users directly relating to the event many times in conjunction with concurrently watching or attending the event e.g. the Super Bowl the Oscars the presidential inauguration etc. . Yet in a social networking system posts related to a particular event are typically mixed in with a variety of unrelated content and can therefore be lost in the shuffle or difficult to follow.

Technology today allows many events to be captured and viewed on television the Internet etc. These broadcast accounts of events e.g. via video audio text description etc. can be followed by users on television websites mobile devices and so forth. A user can easily follow the broadcast of an event of interest while the event is actually happening or being broadcast. However to share this event with other users of a social networking system the user has to do so separately from following the event itself. Using means that are not associated with the event to post about the event may result in the user s post not being read by others until the post is stale and the event has ended or has moved on to a new topic. There is no easy way for the user to simultaneously follow an event outside a social networking system while interacting about the event in real time with other users of a social networking system or other users following the event in general . There is also no mechanism for capturing and using these interactions back in the social networking system.

Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for receiving and displaying posts related to and concurrent with an event or the presentation of an event in a case where the event is not broadcast or presented live . Embodiments of the invention also provide for the receipt and display of additional content that may be unrelated to the event. A user can make posts and share comments with others using an interface associated with an event. These users can be users of the social networking system but they do not need to be.

The interface for receiving and displaying posts related to the event may be provided on an external system e.g. a third party website or other system that is separate or distinct from the social networking system . In such an embodiment the external system receives posts related to an event entered into the interface by users which may be displayed in the interface as a stream of posts. The interface may also display in the stream or in a separate stream in the same or a different interface a stream of posts made by users on a social networking system which have been input into the social networking system rather than the external interface e.g. status updates by users of the social networking system entered into the social networking system . These multiple streams can be viewed by the user in the interface of the external system. The viewing user s posts can be incorporated into any of these streams. The stream of posts from the social networking system displayed to the viewing user may also be limited to posts from users with whom the viewing user has a connection in the social networking system e.g. the user s friends or connections .

In this way in one embodiment an external interface provides the dual streams to a viewer 1 a stream of posts about a particular event entered into the external interface by people concurrently following that event and 2 a stream of posts entered into a social networking system interface and received from the social networking system by the external interface. These posts are not necessarily related to the event and may be filtered to limit the stream of posts only to posts made by the viewing user s connections in the social networking system.

Moreover many social networking systems display feeds or streams populated by posts made by users of the social networking system. Embodiments of the invention allow posts made by users of a social networking system through an external interface e.g. posts related to a particular event to be integrated into the streams on the social networking system. In this way a user can communicate posts about a particular event made on an external system to the social networking system as the user is following the event without needing to log into the social networking system and providing the posts directly to that system.

An illustrative embodiment of the above described invention would where Sam a user of a social networking system is viewing a live streaming video of the Pipeline Masters surf content. Sam would be able to input posts about the contest into an external interface integrated into pipelinemasters.com. That external interface would display a stream of all posts input into the external interface on pipelinemasters.com by other viewers of the event for other users of the interface to view. At the same time the external interface would display a separate stream containing posts of all of Sam s connections in the social networking system. Finally all of Sam s posts entered through the external interface on pipelinemasters.com would also be displayed to Sam and his connections on the social networking website associated with the social networking system.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and then add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein the term connection refers to any user whether an individual or other entity of the social networking system to whom another user has formed a connection association or relationship via the social networking system connections may sometimes also be referred to as friends . Connections may be added explicitly by a user or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . Connections in a social networking system can be one or two way connections. For example if Bob and Joe are both users and connected to each other in the social networking system Bob and Joe have a two way connection. If Bob is interested in learning more information about Joe but there is not a reciprocal connection a one way connection may be formed with Bob being connected to Joe but Joe not being connected to Bob. The connection between users may be a direct connection however some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections. The social networking system keeps a record of information for each user and the connections among the users. The record of users and their connections in the social networking system may be called a social graph. As used herein a social network is a collection of other users to whom a user is connected in the social networking system. A social networking system is the collection of hardware and software that implements a service that allows a collection of users e.g. a social network to communicate and interact with one another.

The social networking system can be a social networking website as described in some examples below but can also be implemented in other ways such as with an application that obtains information about a user s profile from the social networking system using e.g. application programming interfaces APIs . The external system can be any system that is not a part of the social networking system. The external system can be a website e.g. a third party website separate or distinct from the social networking website or hosted on or using a separate machine server subnetwork URL domain etc. but could also be implemented in other manners. A social networking system can also be implemented as one of several features of another website network or system. In such cases the social networking system may simply add a social component to a website with other features and services. The external system can have one or more interfaces for receiving and displaying posts by users or streams of user posts referred to here as external interfaces which can be managed or provided by the social networking system or the external system. The social networking system can has have one or more interfaces for receiving and displaying posts by users or streams of user posts referred to here as social networking interfaces which are managed provided by the social networking system.

The client devices comprise one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via the network . For example the client devices may be desktop computers laptop computers smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities. The client devices are configured to communicate via network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems.

The social networking system comprises a computing system that allows users to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. The social networking system can comprise any entity that provides social networking services communication services dating services and so forth social networking systems do require a website to operate . For example the social networking system can comprise a social networking website that allows one or more users at the client devices to communicate with one another via the website. In one instance the user associated with the client device may communicate with the user associated with another of the client devices via a social networking website that offers the user an opportunity to connect with one or more other users e.g. social network friends .

Systems outside of the social networking system called external systems can receive or access information available in the social networking system . Users of the external system can be users of a social networking system . The external system can access information from the social networking system using for example an API provided by or associated with the social networking system . The social networking system can also provide information e.g. streams of content from users of the system to the external system interface. The external system may use the information obtained from the social networking system for various purposes e.g. for display on an interface on the external system or may simply allow the information to be displayed by the social networking system on an interface on the external system.

The social networking system stores user profiles in the user profile store . Profiles contain information about users of a social networking system such as biographic demographic work experience educational history hobbies or interests location and the like. The user profile store can also store information regarding a user s privacy settings that indicate which other users can view the user s information e.g. everyone friends only friends of friends certain groups of friends etc. . The user can designate certain information as private while other information is public e.g. access to his profile photo for all users but access to other photos only for friends or particular groups of friends . The user can define privacy settings in advance which can be stored in the store and can be adjusted later if desired. The user can also define one or more settings in real time or as needed. For example a user might post a status update on the social networking system and select a setting of post to everyone on live feed. In this case that update can be included in the live feed on the interface of the external system . Similarly the user might post content on the external system and can select privacy settings for that type of content. Thus each user s posts can be displayed in accordance with the privacy settings of those users e.g. displayed only to certain users displayed only on certain external websites etc. .

The social networking system further stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store . The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies educational history and so forth. Additionally the social networking system includes user defined connections between different users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example these user defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed. The connection store thus stores all connection formed by users within the social networking system.

The social networking system also provides a social networking interface with which users can interact described in more detail regarding . The interface allows a user to post content e.g. videos photos links text etc. . For example the user might post a status update indicating that the user is going on a trip this weekend to the Grand Canyon. This post may then be displayed to a number of other users such as the poster s connections e.g. friends in a stream of content called a stream news feed or a live feed. This content stream communicates information that may be relevant to each particular user of the social networking system. Where the social networking system is a social networking website the stories can be presented to a user via one or more web pages of the social networking website for example in each user s home page or news feed page.

Other types of content can also be included in the stream of posts. For example the social networking system can store information related to user actions on and or off the social networking system and these actions can then be reported in the stream of posts. The actions taken by users are recorded in the action log e.g. a database of entries in which an entry is added for each action . After an amount of time the action log will become populated with a number of entries and thus will contain a very rich set of data about the actions of the users. This data can be analyzed and filtered to identify trends and relationships in the actions of the users as well as affinities between the users and various objects. The news content relating to actions taken by users might notify the user that another user associated with him posted new photos commented on something added a connection to another user or otherwise took an action that could be of interest to the user. The content can provide a quick summary e.g. a few lines regarding that particular action taken by the other user which is incorporated into the stream of posts provided to the user. Thus each user is provided with a stream of posts comprising one or a few lines of text content e.g. photos videos hyperlinks music etc. user comments advertising and any other type of content capable of being posted on the Internet or a combination of these items .

As stated above the external interface on the external system can be provided by and managed by either the external system itself or by the social networking system . In embodiments in which the external system manages the external interface the external system includes the modules shown in that operate as described below. In embodiments in which the social networking system manages the external interface the external system may not have certain of the components shown in and the actions described below for these external system modules may be performed by the correspondingly named modules in the social networking system .

Referring now to the modules of the external system illustrated in the user interface module provides displays an interface on an external system as a forum for receiving and displaying posts related to an event. In embodiments in which the social networking system manages the interface on the external system the user interface module of the social networking system can provide or can operate with module to provide this interface for the external system . The event can be a live event and streaming media content regarding this event can be provided alongside or in association with the interface. The external interface can be any type of user interface such as a graphical user interface GUI or a web based user interface WUI . Where the external system is website the event can be a live online event displayed on a web page as streaming content. A web based user interface can be provided for this streaming event. The event can be a historical or noteworthy event such as a presidential election or inauguration. For example the event might be live streaming news coverage of the presidential inauguration provided in a window on a web page of a news website such as CNN.com. However the interface can be associated with any type of an event such as a sporting event a musical concert a news item or any other event e.g. live televised broadcast etc . The interface is described in more detail below regarding .

The post receiving module receives posts provided in the interface by users. In embodiments in which the social networking system manages the external interface the post receiving module of the social networking system can receive or can operate with the module to receive the posts in the manner described below for module . The interface can include a post field into which a particular user can insert one or a few lines of text. For example a user watching a sporting event might insert into the post field of the interface associated with that event a post such as What an amazing play he just made In some embodiments the particular user is not limited to providing lines of text in the interface but can attach or otherwise provide other items including photos videos links event or calendar items etc. The particular user can also comment on other user s posts or indicate that he likes dislikes a user s post e.g. by selecting a like dislike link a thumbs up down icon or in other similar ways .

The post receiving module not only receives a post related to the event entered into the interface on the external system by the particular user in one embodiment but the module also receives a number of other posts related the event entered into the interface by other users. In some embodiments however there is no post receiving module in the system or the module represents simply the interface itself into which posts are entered. Where the interface is associated with a live event the interface can receive posts on the event from many users e.g. thousands or millions as the event is occurring. Since the interface may be provided on the external system in association with the streaming data associated with the event the users can enter posts as the event is happening without having to rely on a separate location for entering posts. Where the external system is a website displaying a live streaming event the user can enter posts directly into the web page without having the move to a separate web page for post entering e.g. a web page of a social networking website .

The post receiving module can also receive a stream of posts from the social networking system . The posts are generated by the social networking system based on actions of one or more users of the social networking system. For example the action can include the user s entry of a post or status update into a social networking interface the user s posting of a photo or video the user s forming of a new connection to another user the user s joining of a fan club for a product or business the user s posting of or subscribing to a new event the user s using of an application the user s tagging of another user in a photo video and any other action that can be performed by a user of a social networking system e.g. actions on the social network actions on third party sites elsewhere on the Internet actions at physical locations etc. . As explained above the social networking system can provide a live feed or news feed of content to users of the system . This stream of content includes stories about various users including their posts comments status updates news about their actions etc. Typically a user receives on the social networking system a feed of information about other users with whom he is connected in the social network e.g. friends of the user . This stream of posts that is provided to the users on the social networking system can also be provided for display on the external interface.

The post receiving module can receive posts or the stream of posts from the social networking system in a number of ways. In one embodiment the social networking system comprises an API interface that other entities such as websites or client applications can access. The external system can call one or more of these APIs and retrieve information about a user entering posts into the external system interface. The term API refers to sets of technologies that allow entities such as websites to interact using Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP JAVASCRIPT and other technologies. For example the social networking website FACEBOOK has incorporated into its platform an open stream API that allows users and other entities including external systems to read and interact with streams of social network content anywhere. Where the API is an open stream API the external system can receive streams of data from the social networking system e.g. a live feed of content regarding the user s social network friends . External systems can directly access a stream of social network content associated with a given user on behalf of that user and can then display the content in the manner most relevant for the user experience e.g. by filtering remixing or displaying the stream in different manners . Using this open stream API users can also publish back into the stream add comments provide likes dislikes and otherwise interact with the with any stream item through any interface that publishes to the stream. In other embodiments no APIs are necessary for the external system to receive and display the stream and the external system has and needs no additional data about the stream the posts or the user connections. For example where the social networking system manages the external interface the social networking system can display or deliver the stream of posts to the external interface. In this case an API is not used for accessing the stream that is displayed in the interface.

For displaying a user s social network content when the user is accessing the external system the user may be required to log into an account associated with the social networking system or may otherwise be asked to provide identifying information. The user may be able to log in or provide information without leaving the external system e.g. without having to navigate to a social networking website . This log in or information providing step may be required in order for the external interface to receive or display the stream or in embodiments in which APIs are used this step may be required for the external system to be able to call the APIs or otherwise access the social network information. In some embodiments the social networking system asks for the user for approval for providing of his information to the external interface. The user can also give approval in advance such as an approval on the social networking system for any display of or access of his content by external systems or by certain defined external systems e.g. all news websites or a list of specific approved websites .

Similarly the user can give approval to provide only certain information which may be governed by privacy settings. In some embodiments this pre approval data by the user can be stored by the social networking system for streamlining or avoiding the log in process for future events that the user views. In other embodiments the user s log in or other identifying data can be stored by the external system in the social network data store . Where the pre approval data is stored by the social networking system the social network data store may be absent from the external system . In some embodiments one or more universal web identity systems can be used in providing streams of posts on the external system . These types systems can provide standard mechanisms for authenticating users by allowing users to log into different services using a universal digital identity e.g. OpenID . In some cases these systems allow users to connect to their social networking identities or accounts e.g. including profile friends privacy settings applications etc. via third party systems or websites e.g. FACEBOOK Connect . In this manner such a universal ID system can be used on the external system to allow to access social networking information while viewing a live online event.

The stream of posts received by module can be the same stream displayed on the social networking system in the social networking interface. However the stream received or provided on the external system can also differ. In one embodiment the user can apply one or more filters to view only certain of the content from the social networking system . For example the user can view content relating only to certain subgroups of friends. The user can also view only content entered into a particular field on the social networking website e.g. content entered into a particular fan site which could be more relevant to the event on the external system . The user can also filter the posts to include only posts relating to the event e.g. a filter by key word searching by entry into particular fields or by another manner of distinguishing between posts on different topics . Similarly the user can elect to view only posts from his connections that were entered into the external interface. The module can continue to receive the stream of posts from the social networking system as the event is occurring and during the entire event. In some embodiments the module receives the stream of posts for a certain period of time e.g. 10 minutes 30 minutes an hour two hours etc. before and or after the event for a pre and post discussion of the event.

The incorporation module incorporates posts from the user into the stream of other posts entered into the external interface and into the stream of posts received from the social networking system . As the user continues to post into the interface of the external system the module continues to incorporate the posts into these streams of content. In other embodiments the external system does not include an incorporation module and instead the user s posts are included with the stream of posts from the social networking system or the incorporation module of the social networking system manages or operates with module to manage the incorporation.

The display module displays the stream of content which may include the user s own posts on the external system or other location where the streams are displayed . In other embodiments the display module of the social networking system manages or operates with module to manage the display on the external system or elsewhere . In one embodiment the user can view two different streams of content. First the user can view a stream of posts entered into the external interface associated with an event. These posts are likely related to the event since they are made concurrently with the event and in some cases in the same interface that is broadcasting the event. Second the user can view a stream of posts from a social networking system of which the user is a member. These posts may or may not be related to the event since some of them are provided in an interface separate from the event e.g. on a social networking website . This stream of posts provided to the user can be limited to content entered by the user s connections e.g. friends of the user . In this manner the user can have a conversation with his social network connections while viewing the event. One or more of the user s connections may also be viewing the event and may be entering posts via the external system interface. Thus in some embodiments the stream of posts from the user s connections may be limited to posts entered in the external interface so those posts will likely be relevant to the event. In one embodiment the posts by the user s connections can be displayed both in the general stream of posts about the event e.g. the first stream described above and the stream of posts originating from the social networking system .

The streaming content can be displayed in a number of different ways. In one embodiment the external interface includes one or more views or viewing means e.g. tabs buttons icons etc. the user can select to view information. For example the interface can provide a general or everyone watching tab that the user can select to view the stream of all posts entered via the external interface. The external interface can also provide a connections or a friends tab that the user can select to view the stream of posts filtered to show only his connections friends posts. This friends tab stream can include posts entered by the user s connections in the external interface in the social networking interface or in both. In this embodiment the two tabs allow a user to switch between viewing the two streams. Other mechanisms can also be used for allowing users to select between the streams. In other embodiments the two streams are provided simultaneously e.g. side by side on the external system . In further embodiments only one stream is provided or additional streams beyond the two streams are provided e.g. different streams of content relating to a user s particular social network groups . Posts from any of these streams may also be displayed in other arrangements and may also be ordered in different ways e.g. relevance chronological etc. .

In some embodiments the user can view these streams of content as he is viewing the event. The posts can be updated in real time so the posts are always up to date. In this manner posts remain relevant to what is occurring in the event. In some embodiments the external system provides the streams of content associated with the event to the social network data store for storage. The event content itself may also be made available for storage in the content store . When this content is stored users can view the event and associated streams of content at a later time. In other embodiments no storage takes place making the social network data store and the content store unnecessary.

The post delivery module manages the delivery of content from the external system to the social networking system . The post delivery module provides the social networking system with posts users make through the external system interface. In other embodiments the post delivery module is absent from the system and the social networking system has access to the posts directly e.g. using module or . These posts can be provided accessed in real time as they are entered into the interface. These posts can then be included in a stream of posts or news feed displayed on the social networking system . In this manner the user s connections friends that are accessing the social networking system can be immediately appraised of posts the user makes while viewing and posting about an event on an external system . The user s connections friends can also respond to or comment on the user s posts via the social networking interface. These responses and or comments can be displayed to the user in the stream on the external interface.

One or more mechanisms can be used to identify from where a given post originated. In one embodiment an icon a link or some other identifier is included with certain posts that denotes whether that post originated on the social networking system or the external system . For example the identifier can indicate that certain of the posts that a user is viewing on the social networking system were entered on an external interface of an external system . The identifier can also provide information about the particular live event with which the posts are associated e.g. identifying the live event providing the time date of the live event and other data about the event . In another embodiment the identifier or icon includes text or a small image. The identifier can also provide sponsorship data or an advertisement associated with the live event. For example posts on the external system relating to a live event can be displayed on the social networking system with information from a sponsor of that live event e.g. Brought to you by Audi .

Referring now to the modules of the social networking system illustrated in a user interface module provides the social networking interface for receiving posts by social networking system users. The module also manages communications between the social networking system and the external system . In some embodiments the module also provides the external interface for receiving and displaying posts related to an event as described above regarding module . The user interface module receives a request from an external system to provide a particular user a stream of posts e.g. posts made or other actions taken on the social networking system . In some embodiments the external system requests that the social networking system send the content to the external system or otherwise provide access to the content. In some embodiments the request is made through an API. The request can also include identifying information or log in data for the user for whom the content is being requested. In other embodiments no request is received by the social networking system . The system simply provides the information without request. The request may also be prompted by a user logging to the external interface using his social networking login credentials clicking on a friends tab or otherwise interacting with the external interface and so forth.

The social networking system can also include a post cache for storing posts by users entered on the social networking interface and or the external interface. In one embodiment when a user s connections post content in either interface some or all of these posts or data regarding these posts can be stored in the post cache until the user requests a stream of content from his connections e.g. by clicking on a friends tab on the external interface by clicking on a live feed link in the social networking system by refreshing a web page etc. . In another embodiment all or part of the posts from a user s connections can be dynamically generated provided by the social networking system when the user requests a stream of content from his connections. The stream of posts by connections of a given user e.g. shown via the friends tab will be unique to that user. The stream can include posts by the user s connections in the social networking interface in the external interface or in both. In a further embodiment the post cache stores posts entered on the external interface for providing a global stream of content to users when users request a stream from everyone watching the event e.g. by clicking on an everyone tab on the external interface . The stream provided via the everyone tab can include anyone on the external system posting via the external interface or can include only users having accounts with or otherwise registered with the social networking system e.g. by prompting users to log in to or sign up with the social networking system to post content . Since this global stream is not unique to any particular user it can be shared amongst users. The global stream of posts will be updated more frequently since it includes a larger set of users and so caching the global stream allows for more efficient streaming of content and focus of rendering resources etc. Similarly since updates occur less frequently to the friends tab stream more resources can be focused on the global stream. In some embodiments all or part of the post cache can be associated with the external system or can otherwise be located outside of the social networking system . In further embodiments some or all of the posts for the friends tab and everyone tab may be stored in content store of the external system .

The post delivery module manages the delivery of content to the external system from the social networking system . The post delivery delivery module provides to the external system the requested stream of posts for display to the user on the external interface. In some embodiments the module is an API that provides the content by providing access to the content via the API. In other embodiments the module itself accesses the external interface and displays the content. The content may also be delivered or accessed according to the user s privacy settings or sharing settings authorizations. In some embodiments the module receives a request to provide for a particular user a stream of posts entered into the social networking interface by the user s connections and the module can the providing of this request stream of posts for display to the particular user in the external interface.

The post receiving module can access or receive posts entered into the external system interface. Specifically the module accesses receives a post related to an event entered into the interface on the external system by a user. As explained above in one embodiment the post delivery module of the external system provides user posts to the social networking system as these posts are entered into the external system interface. The module receives these provided posts. In other embodiments the module itself accesses the posts or receives the posts via the external interface. In some embodiments the module also receives via the social networking interface posts by users of the social networking system.

The incorporation module incorporates the posts accessed received from the external system into a stream of posts on the social networking system . Thus content provided to the user and or his connections on the social networking system can include posts the user made on the external system.

The display module displays posts accessed received from the external system to the user and or his connections on the social networking system . Users accessing the social networking system can thus view posts made on the external system interface by their social networking system connections and may also respond to these posts using the social networking system interface . In embodiments in which the social networking system manages the external interface the module provides for display via the external interface posts from users of the external system.

Below the posts field is the stream of posts displayed in the interface . In this embodiment each post in the stream is associated with a user by other identifying information such as a photo a time entered etc. In other embodiments posts can be associated with users by other information or can be completely anonymous the existence and nature of identifying information can also be left up to the user . There is also provided a comment link that a first user can click on to open up a box below a second user s post. The first user can use this box to make a comment about the second user s post. The third comment from the top in provides an example of a post with additional comments. The box provides a comments field for users to input comments on other posts.

Immediately below the posts field are two tabs. The first tab is an everyone watching tab and the second tab is a friends tab . The user can click on the first tab to view the stream of posts by those using the external interface associated with the event e.g. all posts entered into the post field whether the viewing user knows the poster or not . The user can also click on the second tab to switch the stream of posts made by his connections on the social networking system whether they relate to the event or not and whether they were entered into the post field of the external interface or via an interface on the social networking system in this case the FACEBOOK website .

The system incorporates posts received from either or both of these sources into the interface on the external system into one or more streams of posts content . The external interface then displays for the user one or more streams of posts. As explained above multiple streams can be viewed independently. In some embodiments the user can click on tabs for viewing different streams of content or the streams can be provided simultaneously.

With and the method is illustrated in a flowchart for clarification and ease of presentation. However many of these steps are occurring constantly and concurrently. For example a number of users are entering post at one time into the external interface and into the social networking interface. A number of streams of content are being displayed to many users on both systems at a time. Similarly the systems can constantly and simultaneously be sending receiving accessing content from each other for display.

While various embodiments have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. For example any of the elements associated with the dynamically selected media presentation may employ any of the desired functionality set forth hereinabove. Thus the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments.

Embodiments of this invention may also include a computer readable storage medium having embodied thereon a program the program being executable by a processor for performing a method as described herein for providing dynamically selected media content to a user of an electronic device in a social network environment.
