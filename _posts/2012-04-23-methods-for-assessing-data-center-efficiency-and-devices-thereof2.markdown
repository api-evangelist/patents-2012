This application claims the benefit of Indian Patent Application Filing No. 4602 CHE 2011 filed Dec. 27 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This technology generally relates to methods and devices for assessing the efficiency of a data center and more particularly for determining information technology device and infrastructure utilization information including power utilization in order to generate a value for at least one efficiency metric for the data center.

As data centers become larger and more numerous efficient operation is desirable particularly to reduce energy utilization and associated cost which is a substantial portion of the operational cost of a data center. In order to assess and quantify energy utilization a power usage effectiveness PUE index and its inverse the data center infrastructure efficiency DCIE are two standard efficiency metrics used by data center administrators which consider the power utilization of the information technology IT infrastructure as compared to the total power utilization of the data center.

In order to determine the power utilization of the IT infrastructure including servers switches and storage devices hardware devices such as power meters can be disposed proximate each server device each server rack or between the incoming power supply and the IT infrastructure for example. However monitoring using a plurality of meters requires additional cost to obtain install and maintain the meters additional space which is often at a premium in the data center to locate the meters and an additional mechanism for aggregating displaying and or analyzing the output of the meters such as in the event calculation of an efficiency metric value is desired. In an implementation in which a location exists allowing one meter or relatively few meters to isolate the power utilization of the IT infrastructure or portions thereof the resulting data will lack the granularity required to effectively analyze the IT devices and make decisions to improve the efficiency of the data center.

Software monitoring applications running in the background on each of a plurality of IT devices have also been developed to determine power utilization and communicate the information such as to a central monitoring station. However the agent software applications require additional cost to obtain install and maintain and additional processing cycles of the IT devices when operational which is not desirable.

A method for assessing efficiency of a data center includes querying with a data center efficiency assessment apparatus based on a system management protocol each of a plurality of IT devices to obtain utilization information. A power rating value is obtained at the data center efficiency assessment apparatus for each of the plurality of IT devices. An IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices is generated with the data center efficiency assessment apparatus based on the utilization information for the plurality of IT devices and the power rating values. A value for at least one efficiency metric is generated and output with the data center efficiency assessment apparatus based on the IT power consumption value.

A non transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for assessing efficiency of a data center comprising machine executable code which when executed by at least one processor causes the processor to perform steps including querying based on a system management protocol each of a plurality of IT devices to obtain utilization information. A power rating value is obtained for each of the plurality of IT devices. An IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices is generated based on the utilization information for the plurality of IT devices and the power rating values. A value for at least one efficiency metric is generated and output based on the IT power consumption value.

A data center efficiency assessment apparatus including one or more processors a memory coupled to the one or more processors which are configured to execute programmed instructions stored in the memory including querying based on a system management protocol each of a plurality of IT devices to obtain utilization information. A power rating value is obtained for each of the plurality of IT devices. An IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices is generated based on the utilization information for the plurality of IT devices and the power rating values. A value for at least one efficiency metric is generated and output based on the IT power consumption value.

This technology provides a number of advantages including providing more efficient and accurate methods and devices to assess energy utilization of a data center without the cost and additional infrastructure of power meters and in an agent less deployment without sacrificing granularity of the IT device energy utilization information. With this technology a data center efficiency assessment apparatus communicates with each IT device to obtain utilization information including a percentage utilization of a central processing unit for example. The power utilization of each IT device is generated based on the utilization information and a power rating value for the IT device such as a nameplate power rating established by a vendor of the IT device. Thereby the power utilization of each IT device and associated IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices is based on actual operational characteristics of the IT devices providing for the generation of more accurate efficiency metric values and associated improved assessment of the IT infrastructure and data center energy utilization.

An exemplary method for assessing efficiency of a data center will now be described with reference to . In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus queries based on a system management protocol at least a subset and preferably all of the plurality of IT devices and to obtain utilization information.

The system management protocol can facilitate interfacing with hardware of the IT devices and including CPUs and and or one or more operating system services such as through an operating system application programming interface API for example. The system management protocol utilized by the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can be a Web based enterprise management WBEM protocol a Windows management instrumentation WMI protocol and or a simple network management protocol SNMP for example. Preferably any IT devices and implementing privilege levels are configured to provide administrator privileged for example to the data center efficiency assessment apparatus and the IT devices and further have enabled one or more system management protocols if a system management protocol is not enabled by default. The obtained utilization information for the IT devices and can include workload activity idle state memory utilization disk utilization link utilization and or any other performance information and preferably includes a value for the percentage of utilization of each CPU and for each of the IT devices and . Optionally the data center efficiency assessment apparatus stores the obtained utilization information in the memory .

The operation of the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can be managed by interaction with an administrator interface. In one example parameters selectable by an administrator using the interface can include which IT devices and to monitor which type s of utilization information to monitor and or the frequency with which the data center efficiency assessment apparatus queries the IT devices and .

In order to establish the IT device inventory and appropriately direct the queries in one example the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can discover one or more of the IT devices and based on input to the administrator interface of LAN subnet information for example. Optionally an administrator of the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can input through an administrator interface IT device and information such as host device name manufacturer model storage capacity processing capacity operating system technical specifications and or network address.

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus obtains a power rating value for each of the plurality of IT devices and . In one example a power rating value is obtained from a database in memory as previously stored as associated with each of a plurality of manufacturers and or models of IT devices and or any other identifier of an IT device and for example. Accordingly once inventoried as discussed above information for each IT device and stored in memory can be mapped to a respective power rating value based on the manufacturer and or model information or any other identifying information for example. Preferably the power rating values are based on nameplate power rating values established by a vendor of each IT device and .

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus generates an IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices and based on the utilization information for each of the IT devices and obtained in step and the power rating values for each of the IT devices and obtained in step . In one example the value for the percentage of utilization of each CPU and utilized to generate the IT power consumption value is based on a current value for each IT device and as obtained in step . In another example the value for the percentage of utilization of each CPU and utilized to generate the IT power consumption value is based on an average of a plurality of values for each IT device and previously and currently obtained by a plurality of prior queries in step as stored in the memory . In this example an administrator can input using an administrator interface the time period to be used by the data center efficiency assessment apparatus to calculate the average percentage of utilization of each CPU and . Alternatively the average percentage of utilization of each CPU and can be calculated by default based on all of percentage of utilization values of each CPU and stored in the memory .

Accordingly in this example IT power consumption value is generated based on a summation of the multiplication of the value for the percentage of utilization of each CPU and and the respective power rating value for each IT device and . Because the nameplate power rating value assumes peak utilization the resulting IT power consumption value for the plurality of IT devices and will be relatively accurately determined by effectively reducing the power rating value for each IT device and according to utilization of the IT device and represented by the value for the percentage of utilization of the CPU and for each IT device and .

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus obtains a total power consumption value for the data center . In one example the total power consumption value is obtained by a power meter and communicated to the data center efficiency assessment apparatus over LAN or obtained by a display on the meter and input manually through the administrator interface.

In another example a non IT device power consumption value is obtained which includes utilization information including power utilization for a plurality of non IT devices of the data center including lighting equipment heating equipment cooling equipment switchgear racks monitors and or power supply equipment. The non IT device power consumption value can be obtained by administrator input through the interface of the non IT device inventory and associated power rating for each non IT device and or device type for example. In this example the data center efficiency assessment apparatus obtains the total power consumption value based on a summation of the non IT device power consumption value and the IT power consumption value.

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus generates a value for at least one efficiency metric. In one example the efficiency metric is a power usage effectiveness PUE metric which is generated by dividing the total power consumption value by the IT power consumption value. In another example the efficiency metric is a data center infrastructure efficiency DCIE metric which is generated by dividing the IT power consumption value by the total power consumption value. In other examples the efficiency metric is any non standard metric resulting from a repeatable calculation so as to provide relative comparison to historical data regarding the efficiency of the data center and or IT infrastructure. Accordingly values for such efficiency metrics are advantageously generated based on more accurate data of power utilization of the IT infrastructure calculated based on measured CPU utilization and nameplate power rating values established by vendors of the IT devices and without installing an agent on a plurality of IT devices and and without installing any power meters configured to isolate power utilization of one or more IT devices and .

In one example the data center efficiency assessment apparatus is optionally configured to display a dashboard including efficiency information for the data center such as the exemplary dashboard shown in in order to provide an administrator of the data center with a graphical representation of the power utilization of various of the IT and non IT devices as well as the generated values for the efficiency metric s . A server listing is shown on the dashboard including a name or unique identifier of each server device included in this exemplary assessment of the data center . A percentage CPU utilization listing is shown on the dashboard as including a percentage value associated with each of the server devices of the server listing . Thereby an administrator of the data center can be better informed regarding server devices utilization and can make a more effective decision regarding IT infrastructure inventory to mitigate such issues as server sprawl and ineffective power utilization.

The dashboard further includes a non IT device power consumption value and an IT device power consumption value generated by the data center efficiency assessment apparatus as described above. The dashboard includes a graphical representation of the PUE generated by dividing the IT device power consumption value by the total power consumption value calculated as a summation of the non IT device power consumption value and the IT device power consumption value . The dashboard is shown in for exemplary purposes only and any other report that is graphical and or textual can be generated by the data center efficiency assessment apparatus to include IT device and inventory performance information utilization information and or efficiency metric values for example.

Additionally the dashboard includes a cost listing associated with data center and IT devices such as blade servers rack servers and storage servers in this example. In order to calculate the associated cost an administrator can input to the data center efficiency assessment apparatus through an administrator interface the cost per kilowatt hour kWh of power supplied to the data center . Accordingly the cost listing includes energy cost over a specified period of time for infrastructure of a data center based on the power usage values obtained in step and or input by an administrator and the cost of supplied power.

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus optionally identifies one of a plurality of maturity levels such as those shown in for example based on the value of efficiency metric generated in step such as a PUE value. Exemplary maturity levels including standard advanced optimized and orchestrated are shown in although any number and identification of maturity levels can be utilized.

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus optionally generates one or more recommendations for improving the efficiency metric value generated at step such as a PUE value based on the maturity level identified in step . In the example shown in the data center has a PUE value of 2.74 and therefore the data center efficiency assessment apparatus will identify the standard maturity level . Based on the identification of the standard maturity level and or the PUE value the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can optionally make several recommendation such as removal of underutilized server devices upgrading server devices to rack mounted server devices upgrading server devices to include external storage increasing the internal storage of one or more server devices increasing virtualization upgrading cooling devices upgrading lighting devices and increasing the efficiency of one or more uninterruptable power supplies UPS for example although any number and type of recommendations can be generated.

In step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus optionally generates a projected return on investment ROI for implementing one or more of the recommendations generated in step . For example based on an identification of the manufacturer model and or technical specifications of one or more server devices the data center efficiency assessment apparatus may recommend at step converting one or more legacy server devices to one or more rack mounted server devices. Based on established values as stored in the memory and or values input by an administrator using an administrator interface for the nameplate power rating of the rack mounted server devices and the value for the percentage CPU utilization of the legacy devices obtained at step the data center efficiency assessment apparatus can determine the projected cost savings over a specified time period. With the projected cost savings an administrator can make an informed decision regarding whether the investment required to upgrade to rack mounted server devices is an appropriate action to take to improve the value of the efficiency metric for the respective data center . While the above example is described with respect to a recommendation to upgrade server devices to rack mounted server devices an ROI can be calculated for any number and type of recommendations generated in step .

Accordingly as illustrated and described with the examples herein this technology provides more effective methods and devices for assessing efficiency of a data center particularly with respect to energy efficiency and power utilization. The technology provides an integrated tool for assessing IT infrastructure including IT device inventory performance utilization energy efficiency and operational cost as well as overall data center efficiency as represented by a generated value for one or more efficiency metrics. With this technology data center administrators can better understand based on data obtained and generated without the operational costs of power meters and a software agents installed on each IT device and without sacrificing granularity the energy efficiency maturity level of the respective data center in order to identify and implement strategies to operate the data center more efficiently and reduce power consumption and associated cost.
