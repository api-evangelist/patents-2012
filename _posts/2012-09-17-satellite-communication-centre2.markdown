This application is a United States National Stage Application of and claims the benefit pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Patent Application Serial No. PCT GB2012 052289 filed on Sep. 17 2012 which claims priority to and the benefit of Great Britain Application No. 1116053.8 filed on Sep. 16 2011 both which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

This invention relates generally to the field of communications units. In particular it relates to satellite communications centres which provide converged data video voice telecommunication computing broadband and or satellite capabilities. The invention is suited for use with transportable units or fixed structures which may be land based or water based. It is particularly but not exclusively suited for use with mobile communications centres such as those used by emergency and response organisations for example command and control units or incident response units.

When an incident occurs such as a natural disaster terrorist attack or social disorder those responsible for dealing with the situation require communications links in order to manage and deal with the incident effectively. Temporary and often mobile command centres may be set up to provide a centralised communications hub or command post.

Mobile command centres may be used by organisations such as the emergency services counter terrorist agencies police and government departments and even private sector companies and sporting organisations depending upon the circumstances. In recent times satellite broadband communications have proved extremely useful in conjunction with mobile Incident Command Units ICUs or Mobile Satellite Communications Centres MSCCs as they may be known.

It is often advantageous to set up such ICUs within vehicles so that they may be easily transported to the desired location although portable cabins trailers welfare units and temporary accommodation units may also be fitted out as ICUs. Typically ICU vehicles feature satellite broadband communications PBX voice solutions allowing different types of mobile phones and radio to communicate with each other independent GSM networks in case main GSM networks collapse under the pressure of a major event wireless capabilities and real time video. Mast mounted or rapidly deployable dual thermal and or optical cameras may also be provided along with COFDM body worn cameras.

Combined with the use of wireless laptops access to Virtual Private Networks emergency databases gazetteers mapping the Internet and aerial and satellite imagery these technologies provide ICUs with huge command and communications capabilities and provide solutions which are sufficiently resilient to cope with the kinds of communications overload and failures that often occur during major emergencies.

The provision of satellite broadband and wireless technologies can be particularly advantageous within an ICU because it provides a greater secure data voice and video capacity than was previously possible using conventional technologies. Satellite broadband can be deployed anywhere anytime from temporary mobile or fixed locations. The ICU is able to communicate swiftly and effectively with devices and or staff located remotely from the incident for example staff located at organisational headquarters. Each unit may also be configured to communicate with other communications units providing interoperable and multi agency capabilities.

As a result the suite of integrated communications solutions provided in an ICU vehicle provides commanders and managers with the ability to access accurate information in real time from a wide variety of different applications. The satellite communications enable command and control vehicles to receive and transmit data from all responders and emergency teams to achieve a common operational picture of the incident. Combining this with wireless networks personnel using PDAs laptops mobile phone and data terminals are able to access tactical plans live video streaming or information from strategic emergency planning software. The range can be extended using self powered rapidly deployable MESH wireless nodes.

However although the large and diverse array of devices provided on such ICUs offer advantageous technical abilities the large variety of devices can pose a problem for the staff who have to manage control and monitor them. Typically each device must be managed independently of the other devices. There is no simple centralised means of coordinating the activities of the various devices and so the operator must frequently switch between a potentially large number of devices in order to monitor their operational status. This slows the operator down during a potentially time pressured emergency or incident and complicates the role of the operator.

A similar difficulty arises in respect of communication centres provided on or in marine based units such as ships. Modern watercraft often carry sophisticated communications technologies including satellite capabilities. As explained above the number and variety of devices provided in conjunction with such communications centres can make the technology difficult to use because the operator must be proficient with at using each individual device and needs to repeatedly switch between a potentially large number of devices as and when required.

US 2007 0149120 A1 Money discloses a system for establishing and maintaining communications across disparate networks comprising a satellite dish and control unit. The control unit comprises a network management server and a satellite alignment component. However the arrangement disclosed in Money does not offer a mechanism for reducing the effort time and expertise required to interact with and control each of the devices individually.

Thus in accordance with the present invention there is provided a computer implemented system and method as claimed herein.

The invention is suitable for managing and or monitoring a plurality of devices provided in conjunction with a communications centre carried in or on a unit. The system is arranged and configured to permit a user to monitor manipulate or manage the plurality of devices via a consolidated interface. The communications unit may be mobile or transportable.

The invention provides the user with a simplified centralised mechanism for managing the devices associated with the unit. In one sense the invention provides the operator with a dashboard style interface which presents a consolidated view of the plurality of devices. The user can more easily view monitor and or manage the devices via an integrated interface rather than considering each device individually or consecutively thus saving time and effort for the operator who no longer needs to switch between individual and often technically very different device interfaces in order to coordinate the unit s activities.

For the sake of clarity it should be noted that the term interface is not limited in this context to meaning simply a graphical user interface or visual presentation mechanism. While the invention does provide a visual representation to the user this is only one aspect of the technical contribution made by the system and corresponding method. Rather the invention can be thought of as a management or facilitation solution which enables the effective coordination of separate and possibly otherwise incompatible elements such that their functionalities can be utilised in a new and advantageous manner.

In effect the invention provides a layer of abstraction between the user and the various hardware software components such that the user is able to survey and harness the functionality of the components without being distracted or impeded by low level device specific details.

The system provides a consolidated interface to enable a user to monitor manipulate or manage the plurality of devices via the interface.

The plurality of devices may include a satellite support mechanism supporting satellite related equipment provided in association with the unit. The satellite related equipment may be a satellite dish or antenna.

The system may comprise a satellite controller component arranged and configured to enable a user to manipulate and or re orientate the satellite support mechanism via the interface. Thus the satellite controller may be used to physically re orientate or reconfigure the satellite equipment. For example such that the satellite dish points in a different direction and or is tilted at a different angle.

A variety of users may be able to access and or view the devices via the integrated interface. For example a manager in a remotely located headquarters or a service provider at a remote office may log into the system in addition to or alternatively to an operator sitting in the unit. This provides the advantage that data is shared amongst and available to all the parties who need it.

The communications unit may be a vehicle. The unit may be land based or water based such as a ship or boat for example . The unit may be a self propelling vehicle such as an automotive vehicle e.g. a truck. Alternatively the unit may be a trailer welfare unit or a portable accommodation unit.

In some embodiments of the invention the vehicle may be an emergency response vehicle such as an ambulance a police vehicle a counter terrorist unit a fire rescue response vehicle or the like. Alternatively the unit may be a non motorised unit. The unit may be configured for use as a command centre or communications centre. The invention is not intended to be limited in respect of the type of unit with which it is used.

The plurality of devices may further include a telecommunication device a mechanical device and or a computing device. For example the plurality of devices may include a telephone a meteorological device a compass and or a camera.

Preferably the user is able to monitor manipulate or manage the plurality of devices via the consolidated interface from a remote location relative to the unit.

Preferably the system comprises at least one monitoring component arranged and configured to assess the current status of each or at least some of the plurality of devices. Preferably the current status pertains to the orientation position or operational state of the respective devices. For example the operational state may be on off transmitting etc. The position and or orientation may relate to the physical configuration of the device for example the position or configuration of an antenna or satellite dish.

Preferably the system comprises a presentation device for presenting the consolidated interface to the user. The presentation device may be a screen computer monitor or other graphical display device.

Preferably the system comprises at least one monitoring component configured to control or adapt the status of at least one of the plurality of devices. The monitoring component may comprise a hardware device and or software component.

Preferably the consolidated interface comprises a representation of the current status of each device as assessed by the monitoring component. The representation may be an icon or other graphical representation of the device. The representation may be colour coded to illustrate or indicate the operational status of the device for example the device may be represented in green if switched on or in red if switched off. Other visual means may be used to reflect or indicate the operational status of the device e.g. the icon may flash if a problem is detected with a particular device.

Beneficially the consolidated interface comprises a navigation tool such as a navigation bar. The navigation bar may comprise at least one icon representing a page to which the user can navigate. The page may present information relating to the activity and or functionality of at least one of the plurality of monitored devices.

Preferably the monitoring component comprises at least one software component and the system further comprises a microprocessor arranged and configured to execute the at least one software component.

Preferably the at least one monitoring component is arranged and configured to receive data from the device and or send data to the device.

Preferably the at least one monitoring component is arranged and configured to detect whether data is being transmitted across a communications channel.

Preferably the system further comprises a backup independent network capability and or battery backup component. For example it may comprise a 3G network capability or other technology suited for this purpose. This provides the advantage that even in the event of power loss to the vehicle unit the system can still be contacted e.g. by a support organisation for diagnostic and repair purposes. For example problems such as satellite link failure can be investigated and corrected even when the main means of contacting the monitored plurality of devices for remote support has failed.

Beneficially the system may be arranged and configured to store data received from the plurality of devices and automatically upload said data to an alternative location. This data may be video voice or other data. For example the data gathered from the devices may be transferred to a server for back up purposes. The server may be located remotely from the communications unit. The transfer of the data may be performed upon command by a user or at a predetermined time or at scheduled intervals. This feature provides the advantage that the data can be stored automatically thus simplifying the role of the personnel operating the unit and ensuring that the back up task is not over looked.

Also in accordance with the present invention there is provided a corresponding computer implemented method for managing or monitoring a plurality of devices provided in conjunction with a unit the method comprising the step of permitting a user to monitor the plurality of devices via a consolidated interface.

The plurality of devices comprises a satellite support mechanism supporting satellite related equipment provided in association with the unit.

The method also includes the step of providing a satellite controller component arranged and configured to enable a user to manipulate and or re orientate the satellite support mechanism via the interface.

The unit may be a mobile communications unit. Additionally or alternatively it may be a vehicle. The unit may be land based or water based such as a ship or boat for example . The unit may be an emergency response vehicle such as an ambulance or police vehicle. Alternatively it may be non motorised. It may be a trailer welfare unit or the like. The unit may be an incident command unit.

Additionally the method may further comprise the step of providing at least one hardware or software component configured to control or adapt the status of at least one of the plurality of devices.

These and other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiment described herein.

An exemplary embodiment is now described in relation to an incident control unit. However it should be noted that the invention may also be implemented in a variety of other contexts for example it may be installed on a boat to provide an improved mechanism for monitoring and or interacting with the boat s diverse pieces of equipment.

Major incidents such as disasters and terrorist attacks often affect wide geographical areas and last for a significant length of time. These factors can place huge demands on emergency response management organisations and their resources whether those organisations are working alone or in partnership with other agencies. Within such high pressure environments it is crucial that clear command communications are established and maintained within a very short space of time from the arrival of the emergency services.

In such circumstances a control communications unit ICU such as that of is provided with communications facilities for management of such incidents. Such units provide command post infrastructure via converged communications broadband internet fax intranet voice and video data and other wireless capabilities .

Turning to a illustrative embodiment of the invention is shown. A typical mobile communications unit is illustrated having a variety of devices provided thereon. The unit is a vehicle provided with satellite broadband and wireless communications capabilities. The exterior of the illustrative vehicle shown in is provided with

In addition body worn cameras having remote transmission facilities may be worn by field personnel as shown in . These devices may utilize a variety of transmission standards including COFDM wireless GSM and 3G to suit the purpose and levels of resilience required.

Other items of equipment may be provided in addition to those shown in the illustrative embodiment. The type and number of devices provided will be chosen in accordance with the operator s needs.

The present invention provides a common user interface such that an operator user can control and monitor the various technology devices via a centralised mechanism. It does this by employing various software and hardware integrators utilising existing Application Programming Interfaces API where available and interface grooming where required. Thus the invention is arranged to provide a consolidated view of the various devices to the user at the front end whilst communicating with the devices at the back end .

The system employs backend or server side daemonised processes which are invisible to the user for continuous monitoring and control of hardware devices this software also provides the API for the front end software to interface with.

The front end of the system is the user interface and runs within an internet browser application. The front end relies on the backend software to provide data for display to accept commands from the user and to effect changes upon hardware devices.

In use the user is provided with various functional components which enable the user to perform various tasks in respect of the devices. These functionalities will now be described.

An overview of this feature is shown as a flowchart in . An example screen shot of the system status page is shown in .

This component provides an overview of the status of the devices provided on the vehicle and enables detailed device interrogation of the associated devices. Devices are shown as icons or representation displayed on a screen. The icons may be colour coded to reflect the operational status of a device . For example if a particular item of equipment is switched on and functioning normally it may be shown as a green icon. Alternatively if it is powered off or there is a problem with the device it may be represented in red. This provides the advantage amongst others that the operator can see quickly and easily and identify at a glance which devices are functional and which need attention. The operator does not need to interrogate each device individually in order to monitor assess and manage the plurality of devices.

The system status page displays a visual overview of all monitored vehicle systems and features providing a Dashboard like status of the vehicle. This feature can interrogate a wide variety of technologies by appropriate methods automatically updating status information for many devices. This information can be made available to suitably authenticated parties at remote locations. This can be presented as a home page which provides an overview of the various devices provided on the vehicle as shown in . Other information such as alert information or test result information may also be displayed.

The interface also comprises a navigation bar which is used to alert the user to any device related activity which may have occurred in respect of applications or devices. For example if an application is running in the background any change in application or device status is brought to the user s attention via this feature. The navigation bar includes icons representing functional groupings of the various devices. Each icon represents a page which the user can navigate to the page then showing detail relating to the activity of a particular device or group of devices. The icons are colour coded to indicate the status of the device e.g. green for on and may pulse or flash if a change in status has occurred. For example if a device or group of devices has suddenly lost power the icon representing the page relating to this device in the navigation bar may pulse red which will attract the user s attention. The user can then select the appropriate interface page relating to the device s to find out more information relating to the activity. The user may then interrogate the device or investigate further and take any necessary remedial action. For example if the system is indicating that there has been some activity relating to a telephone device e.g. a change in status or a problem relating to that piece of equipment the user can click on the phones icon in the navigation bar to jump to the phones page which will show more detailed information relating to the status of the telephone device s .

As well as providing immediate diagnostic information and rectification advice for known classes of issues the status page aids in rapid support call identification of faults and their remedies this increases first time fix rates improves pre site visit information and leads to improved up time where the vehicle is in full operational capability.

The backend software for the system status feature makes use of specific technologies to leverage information about a device. Most devices respond to standard network based interrogation and this is the baseline method used in the exemplary embodiment. The ability to extend this baseline to account for specific devices or protocols has been a significant principle in the development of the present invention.

The backend software for the status feature forms part of the core software of the invention. Other system features depend on this software component usually invisibly but the system status feature displays these results to the user as a system overview.

This component shows a view of all video sources associated with the vehicle along with display outputs and current setup. It provides

The screen selector is a software interface to video signal switching and distribution systems. It presents to the user a clear and concise control that is tailored to the specific vehicle setup and has been developed in direct response to user operator requirements. This control can be extended to suitable connected devices outside the vehicle enabling the display on external screens to be manipulated during outside briefing etc.

The screen selector feature interfaces with a video distribution system providing control commands and reading status information. The user interface is tailored to the devices available and visually indicates the connectivity information. This device may be provided as a hardware module although the skilled addressee will understand that it could alternatively be developed as software only providing the host has a suitable interface available such as RS422.

This component serves as the vehicle s telephone and radio call control centre. An example screen shot of the call connect page is shown in . This page would be arrived at after the user has clicked on the phones icon in the navigation bar .

The call connect component enables patching to multiple devices such that for example radio based communications can be patched through to mobile or land line telephone devices. The functionality of this feature includes 

The call connect page is the voice call centre for the inventive system. It is the call connect feature that enables a vehicle to serve as the single point of contact for command centre headquarters field personnel and other agencies in any scenario. During an incident it is crucial that vital information is passed to command centres. If desired the call connect facility may be configured for administration by a remote operator freeing the vehicular operators for other tasks.

The call connect feature provides a user interface to a Private Branch Exchange PBX device. Connectivity information is collected from the PBX and displayed as an operator interface to the user. Call commands are sent to the PBX to instigate changes such as placing or connecting calls. In essence an operator is able to patch incoming calls from one type of technology through to another type of technology. Multiple conference calls are also capable of being operated simultaneously.

This enables the user to control of the satellite system easily via the clickable icons buttons displayed on the screen. An example of the satellite control page is shown in and can be jumped to by the user by clicking on the satellite icon in the navigation bar .

This feature brings a software interface from the satellite controller to the user s command position . There is one button to deploy and connect one button to stow the receiver. Added benefits from this feature are a clear signal strength indication and an orientation feature which shows the antenna azimuth and any blind spots from other hardware on the vehicle roofline. Thus the satellite equipment can be easily reconfigured and or positioned by the user via the interface.

This feature significantly aids the user by ensuring that the satellite platform has no obstructions and therefore clear line of sight to lock on.

Satellite communication systems are core hardware within an ICU. This feature reflects this importance providing ease of use and control.

The details of the satellite connection conditions monitored by this feature can be made available to remote support staff this can be invaluable for diagnosis of connectivity issues.

The system also comprises a 3G network capability and battery backup. Therefore even in the event of total vehicle power loss the system can be contacted e.g. by a support organisation for the purpose of diagnostics and possible remote repair. This enables the diagnosis and identification of the cause of problems such as satellite link failure even when the main means of contacting the vehicle equipment for remote support has failed.

An overview of this component is shown as a flowchart in . Examples screen shots of the basic power control screen and advanced power control screen are shown in respectively.

This components enables the user to control the startup shutdown and power mode of vehicle systems. Functionality includes

Power is the bedrock for all installed technologies. Bringing systems into action and switching them out of action must be handled correctly. This feature makes changing power states a simple and robust process. With full control of power states users are able to safely command the vehicle into specific modes of operation. This then enables offline tasks to be performed without the requirement to monitor and revisit the vehicle after scheduled tasks have been completed. As the incorrect shutdown of vehicle operating systems can be a cause of device failure this feature greatly reduces the risk of such failures and the associated down times where the vehicle is not in full operational capacity.

The power control feature of the invention is designed to provide software automation of hardware devices as a set of dependant items. Instead of many separate devices being controlled individually this feature presents a single system that operates in distinct modes. Traversal between modes is conducted in an orderly fashion based on the dependencies between devices.

The common element to all devices in this respect is power which this feature controls by a power distribution switching unit. Many devices require specific actions to be performed before power is disconnected and this software component orchestrates prerequisites invisibly to the user. Thus the various tasks can be performed sequentially in the order required. The usual prerequisite is an operating system shutdown.

The system comprises a control box having a front panel. The front panel features illuminated push buttons grouped as follows.

A group of three buttons which can be used to command the system to set the power state of the equipment under control and via button illumination to observe which power state the equipment is in. Each button is used to command a transition 

Another illuminated button is used to indicate whether the system itself is powered on and whether the monitoring software is running correctly. The button can also be used to power on the system itself and to reboot it in the case that the software within has stopped operating or to initiate a power up of the system if it has been completely shut down. The action of the button is enabled or disabled by a separate watchdog timer circuit which is powered by an auxiliary power output from the system and also acts upon the receipt of a regular series of timed pulses from another GPIO general purpose input output output on the system that is toggled by a routine running within the monitoring software. In the normal running condition the pulse will regularly reset the timer and the circuit causes the button to light up a steady green. In this condition the button has no effect on the system. If the pulse train stops being sent and the system output remains in either a high or low state for too long i.e. the software is no longer running the timer will cause the button to light up red indicating a system fault and also enable the button which can then be used to power the system off and on again to see if this rectifies the fault condition. If there is no illumination then this indicates that the system is powered down. In this condition the button is also enabled and can be used to initiate power up of the system. Thus in summary if the light is green then the system is functioning as expected and pressing the button has no effect if the light is red then something is amiss with the system and the button can reset it if the light is off then the button can be used to power up the system.

The advanced power control page displays icons representing each individual device to allow the user to manually control each separate power source. Each icon allows the option of on off or reboot for each device. By clicking on the basic controls page the user will return to the screen shown in .

Therefore the invention provides a management tool which interfaces with various forms of known devices. This managerial solution is not provided in US2007 149120 A1 Money described above although it could be used in conjunction with the system described in Money to consolidate all of the individual elements and present information and control in a centralised form thus enhancing the usability of the system s devices and saving time and effort for the user. This centralised information and control would then be accessible from any networked computer via a web browser.

In this sense the invention serves as an umbrella over the existing products and systems to allow the relevant information and control to be easily accessible to the operator without the need to interface with lots of individual systems. The invention does not replace these systems devices which can still function independently in the case that the invention fails.

For example with respect to the satellite control page the invention interfaces with an existing satellite system. The satellite can still be deployed by the controller that is provided by the satellite manufacturer. The invention takes only the information and control buttons that are needed for day to day operational tasks and displays them in a simplistic form to the user alongside the information from the other devices e.g. power weather status etc.
