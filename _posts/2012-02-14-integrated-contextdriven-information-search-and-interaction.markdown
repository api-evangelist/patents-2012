With the ubiquity of computing devices such as laptop computers computing pads and tablets and powerful smartphones among others and widely available high speed computer networks access to information is easier than ever. However the hidden cost of this ease of access to information is the abundance of irrelevant information and the difficulty of finding useful information. Additionally when people discuss a subject their collaboration process and interaction often may be disconnected from the major sources of information about the topic discussed. For example when two people discuss an article from a news source such as CNN Cable News Network they may do so using particular software applications such as e mail SBN and the like but when they actually access the CNN web page their discussion and collaborative experience is not present on the CNN web page.

File data and application software may be stored on servers such as Microsoft s SharePoint server and be made accessible to multiple users. However as the amount of data files and directories quickly multiply over time especially in an enterprise environment finding useful and relevant information may become a time consuming challenge. Therefore providing accurate context based information which is relevant to what the user is currently viewing or working on can be highly valuable.

In some embodiments a user of the web page may install integrated SBN functionality in his browser to allow automatic or manually initiated automatic search for and presentation of relevant information about the content of the web page and or about the web page itself. In these embodiments the integrated SBN functionality is available only on the client computing device of the user. In other embodiments the SBN integrated functionality may be built in to the web server for example using a scripting language such as JavaScript and be available to all users of the web pages served by the web server.

In various embodiments activating SBN functionality for example by selecting SBN button an additional pane is opened by the integration software module in the same web page while in other embodiments a new SBN window may be opened which is related to the current web page. In other embodiments the user may select how he wants the SBN information to be presented by setting appropriate options on the browser and or plug in interface.

In operation in various embodiments the users opens a webpage to browse information on a particular web site. Depending on user settings and or integrated SBN configuration an integrated SBN interface is presented to the user. In some embodiments this integrated SBN interface may have the form of a pane within current webpage or may take the form of a separate window. In some embodiments the integrated SBN interface may take a form of a scrolling information ribbon in some area of the computer screen such as the bottom edge. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many other user interfaces are possible without departing from the spirit of the present disclosures. Regardless of the SBN user interface the integrated SBN interface is related to and or aware of the current webpage via data and or metadata associated with the current webpage.

In some embodiments the user may select content of the current web page which may include text images links icons or other content and then click on SBN button to launch an automatic search for information by the integrated SBN from various sources such as SBN databases the Web social networking sites like Facebook and Linkedin and any other computer accessible sources of data available. In some embodiments activating SBN button may result in using other methods instead of or in addition to search to retrieve relevant information about current content such as fetching pre associated information for example by using an index to an existing database table without performing a search. In other embodiments hovering the cursor over content triggers search and fetch of relevant information by the integrated SBN for simultaneous display to the user.

In various embodiments the integrated SBN the relevant information includes saved conversations or discussions between the user and other users or between other users from the SBN databases and or platforms. For example selecting content on the current web page may trigger SBN to search and display a conversation supplemental content on a related subject in the supplemental information pane . Similarly SBN may search other social networking sites and the web to present articles in articles section and social networking content in social networking section .

The search results provided by the integrated SBN may include text and images. For example a search based on a selected content cat may return results that typically include textual data and some images of cats. In various embodiments the search function of the integrated SBN component searches the web for images using commercial search engines such as Google and Yahoo . Search engine API may be used to filter search results according to intellectual property rights such as copyright and trademark. As such the SBN search functionality makes it unnecessary for the user to perform a separate search to obtain supplemental information.

In various embodiments the user may go through a setup process to specify the type format and scope of searches to be performed. For example a user may specify the search to cover social network sites only SBN database only text only images only conversations only and the like or any combination thereof. In some embodiments the user may also select advanced search options in the setup process to view additional search parameters and settings to be used as criteria to further restrict the search. For example in the advanced search settings the user may include or exclude a date range a particular source image size image format and the like.

In some embodiments metadata may be used by the integrated SBN to search sort group categorize or otherwise organize search results for presentation to the user via pane . The metadata may be obtained from various sources such as the webpage source code third party databases associated with the web page owner and the like. Secondary metadata may also be obtained from a preliminary search on the search subject.

The supplemental information about the company may be presented in the supplemental content section and include prior idea exchanges and conversations saved on SBN databases social networking posts regarding the company blogs and web news among others.

Similarly if link is selected for the particular webpage the supplemental information found and presented will be most relevant to the general subject or contents of the webpage. The general subject of the webpage may include a project or product by the owner for example a company of the webpage a technology employed by the owner in its products services offered by the owner and the like. The contents of the webpage may include particular news blogs about a related industry white papers founders biographical information and the like. The supplemental information about the webpage may be presented in the supplemental content section and include prior idea exchanges and conversations saved on SBN databases social networking posts regarding the company blogs and web news among others.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many other types of custom links may be configured for the integrated SBN in a webpage or website without departing from the spirit of the present disclosures. For example a Competition custom search link may be used to search and present information from various external and or SBN sources related to the competitors of a company owner of the web page.

In some embodiments the URL in URL field may be used to search source code of webpage to find various metadata not explicitly visible on the webpage. For example the full company name Sales Force may be found embedded in a script tag within the source code. The full company name may then be used to search for and present information relevant to the company.

In various embodiments a user viewing webpage may be interested in exchanging views and ideas with another user about selected content . The user may start a written conversation with the other user without leaving the webpage or using another application program such as email or IM. In some embodiments the user may select the content click on SBN button and be presented with a dialog box from which the user may select the other user to request commencement of the conversation. Conversation may then take place in substantially real time on the same webpage providing full context of the conversation. In some embodiments once the other user is notified of the request a copy of the same webpage is opened for the other user to allow the conversation to take place in the same context for both users. A record of the conversation may be stored by the integrated SBN for future reference and use. Supplemental information may also be automatically presented to the users to enrich and further inform their conversation.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many other arrangements may be utilized to allow an in context integrated conversation as described above between users without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. For example a separate dialog window may be opened to carry out the written conversation while still displaying the same webpage and recording the conversation. In another embodiment an audio visual or multi media exchange may be arranged between the users hosted in the webpage or in a separate window while still integrated and having shared data with the SBN and or the webpage. In some embodiments a speech recognition module may convert the spoken conversation to written text for easy transmission and use in documents and or future searches.

Custom software cartridge is associated with an existing plugin component on a target webpage to modify the behavior of the plugin in particular ways according to the behaviors and rules embedded in the custom software cartridge. For example a cartridge may be defined to change the color or other attributes such as font of text associated with a particular area such as a side pane of the browser window in which the text is displayed. As such the custom software cartridge may be viewed as a dynamic behavior supplement or modifier to the existing plugin on the target webpage. That is the custom software cartridge may be provided by a party different from the developer of the plugin component and may be applied withdrawn or changed dynamically after the deployment and installation of the plugin component thus providing a mechanism for altering the behavior of the plugin component without having to redesign and redeploy the plugin component.

The supplemental behavior provided by the custom software cartridge is not limited to changes to text and may include any functionality which can be implemented by a client side script. In various embodiments such functionality may include communicating with a server side script downloading files presenting a user interface on the target webpage accessing a database acquiring user input playing multimedia files and the like.

In operation in various embodiments the user of SBN site uses cartridge creation webpage to define the behavior of custom software cartridge and specify the list of websites to which the cartridge is applied. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different user interfaces may be used for defining the behavior of custom software cartridge . For example a scripting language may be entered by user to fully define how the cartridge will behave once associated with a plugin component on a target webpage. In other embodiments the user may select one of multiple predefined cartridges to add certain desired behavior to the plugin. While in other various embodiments the user may be presented with an interface which helps the user define the cartridge behavior requirements and or logic he wants in a simplified manner and a backend script translates the user s requirements and logic into a working script embedded in the cartridge.

In still other various embodiments the custom software cartridge may dynamically download and or associate other custom cartridges to perform other predefined functions when associated with the plugin component. For example the user may associate a first custom software cartridge with a plugin component to perform play find and play a video on a selected keyword. The first custom software cartridge may then employ the services of two other custom software cartridges one to search for the keyword and find a related video and another one to download an browser hosted media player to play the video while the first custom software manages the overall high level process.

Once the custom software cartridge has been defined and the list of target web sites or web pages to which the cartridge will be applied has been specified the same or a different user may use a local machine a client device to visit one of the target websites webpages. In various embodiments the existing SBN plugin component for example SBN button of may capture the domain name of the hosting website and communicate the name with the SBN website to determine whether a custom cartridge is available for the target webpage. In various embodiments the applicable custom software cartridges for a particular target website are determined based on a combination of an ID of the plugin component and the domain name of the target website. This way the same target website may be visited by two different users each user having a different plugin component on his local machine and provide a different experiences for each of the two users due to the use of different cartridges. This arrangement may be advantageous because it allows two different subscribers for example two different companies to the SBN organization to define different custom cartridges for the same target website thus providing a different custom experience for their respective users when visiting the same target website.

In some embodiments a standard directory URL or similar location specification is used to store the custom software cartridges. The standard storage location for the custom software cartridges is searched to find any cartridges applicable to a particular website in response to a plugin component inquiry from the particular website. If such cartridge is found the rules or behaviors defined thereby are applied for example by downloading a client side script segment to the user s local client machine to be applied to the target website on the local machine. Therefore the user s experience in visiting a target website is customized only on the user s local machine. Other users visiting the same target website may have a different experience depending on the plugin component and the cartridges applied to their local machines.

In various embodiments a user associated with an organization which created custom software cartridge visiting the target website at URL may use particular functions provided by the custom cartridge to enhance his experience perform tasks and or access information not readily available on the target website. For example a user who works at a shoe manufacturing company may use a public search website such as Google to find out what their competitors are doing. A custom software cartridge may be designed by the shoe manufacturing company to highlight their main competitors names for example by making text bold or appear in all capitals in the search results or in the sponsored links area. This way the user can easily spot links related to their competitors. Other software cartridges may be designed to offer different functions at different times for the same website allowing dynamic selection of various behaviors by users without altering the plugin components or the target websites.

Using custom software cartridges allows some control of the plugin components behaviors by third parties distinct from the developers of the plugin components providing more customization opportunities for subscribers or customers of SBN services.
