This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT Application No. PCT US2012 054354 filed Sep. 10 2012 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 535 589 filed Sep. 16 2011.

The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium ROMK channel Kir1.1 see e.g. Ho K. et al. Nature 1993 362 6415 p. 31 8.1 2 and Shuck M. E. et al. J Biol Chem 1994 269 39 p. 24261 70 is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney thick ascending loop of Henle TALH and cortical collecting duct CCD see Hebert S. C. et al. Physiol Rev 2005 85 1 p. 319 713 . At the TALH ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na K 2Clco transporter the rate determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride sensitive sodium channel see Reinalter S. C. et al. Acta Physiol Scand 2004 181 4 p. 513 21 and Wang W. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 2004 13 5 p. 549 55 . Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors are predicted to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities i.e. hypo or hyperkalemia new onset of diabetes dyslipidemia over the currently used clinical agents see Lifton R. P. A. G. Gharavi and D. S. Geller Cell 2001 104 4 p. 545 56 . Human genetics Ji W. et al. Nat Genet 2008 40 5 p. 592 9 and Tobin M. D. et al. Hypertension 2008 51 6 p. 1658 64 and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents see Lorenz J. N. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37871 80 and Lu M. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37881 7 support these expectations. To our knowledge the first small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis L. M. et al. 7.1 Mol Pharmacol 2009 76 5 p. 1094 1103.

As used herein except if noted otherwise alkyl is intended to include both branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Commonly used abbreviations for alkyl groups are used throughout the specification. For example the term Calkyl or C Calkyl means linear or branched chain alkyl groups including all isomers having the specified number of carbon atoms and includes all of the hexyl and pentyl isomers as well as n iso sec and tert butyl butyl s butyl i butyl t butyl Bu butyl n and i propyl Pr propyl ethyl Et and methyl Me .

 Cycloalkyl is a cyclized alkyl ring having the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The cycloalkyl ring may be substituted on any available carbon which results in the creation of a stable structure including the ring carbon which serves as the point of attachment to the rest of the molecule.

In some instances the number of substituents which may be optionally present on a moiety is specified for example but not limited to 1 to 3 of F fluoro . For example an alkyl group that can be optionally substituted with 1 3 of F includes but is not limited to CH CHF CHF CF CHCH CH CHF CH CHF CHF CHF CHCF CHF CHF CH CH CH CF CH CH CF CH CH CF CH and CH CF as appropriate for the defined number of carbon atoms for the given alkyl group.

Halo or halogen refers to F fluoro Cl chloro Br bromo and I iodo . In one embodiment halogens are F and Cl.

The term heteroaryl alone or in combination means six membered aromatic rings containing one to four nitrogen atoms benzofused six membered aromatic rings containing one to three nitrogen atoms five membered aromatic rings containing one oxygen one nitrogen or one sulfur atom benzofused five membered aromatic rings containing one oxygen one nitrogen or one sulfur atom five membered aromatic rings containing two heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen nitrogen and sulfur and benzofused derivatives of such rings five membered aromatic rings containing three nitrogen atoms and benzofused derivatives thereof a tetrazolyl ring a thiazinyl ring or coumarinyl. Examples of such ring systems are furanyl thienyl pyrrolyl pyridinyl pyrimidinyl indolyl quinolinyl isoquinolinyl imidazolyl triazinyl thiazolyl isothiazolyl pyridazinyl pyrazolyl oxazolyl isoxazolyl benzothienyl quinazolinyl and quinoxalinyl.

Unless expressly depicted or described otherwise variables depicted in a structural formula with a floating bond such as each of substituents R R Rand R are permitted on any available carbon atom in the ring to which each is attached.

The present invention encompasses all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have R configuration or S configuration. When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention it is understood that both the R and S configurations of the chiral carbon and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof are embraced within the Formula. Similarly when a compound name is recited without a chiral designation for a chiral carbon it is understood that both the R and S configurations of the chiral carbon and hence individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof are embraced by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.

The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers for example mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in all ratios. Thus enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out if desired by separation of a mixture by customary methods for example by chromatography or crystallization by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized if necessary with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers as well as salts solvates including hydrates and solvated salts of such racemates enantiomers diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.

Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment e.g. Formula I or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the formula or embodiment including salts thereof particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

In the compounds of Formula I the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example different isotopic forms of hydrogen H include protium H and deuterium H . Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages such as increasing in vivo half life or reducing dosage requirements or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically enriched reagents and or intermediates.

When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically acceptable salts in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention for example as alkali metal salts alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts potassium salts calcium salts magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as for example ethylamine ethanolamine triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups i.e. groups which can be protonated can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as for example but not limited to salts with hydrogen chloride hydrogen bromide phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid benzenesulfonic acid methanesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid naphthalenedisulfonic acids oxalic acid acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid tartaric acid lactic acid salicylic acid benzoic acid formic acid propionic acid pivalic acid diethylacetic acid malonic acid succinic acid pimelic acid fumaric acid maleic acid malic acid sulfaminic acid phenylpropionic acid gluconic acid ascorbic acid isonicotinic acid citric acid adipic acid etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes in addition to the salt forms mentioned inner salts or betaines zwitterions . Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which owing to low physiological compatibility are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used for example as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Furthermore compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and or one or more crystalline forms and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water i.e. a hydrate or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention along with un solvated and anhydrous forms.

Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid or COOdepending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modifications include but are not limited to Calkyl esters and Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.

Accordingly the compounds within the generic structural formulas embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts all possible stereoisomers and tautomers physical forms e.g. amorphous and crystalline forms solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms as well as the salts thereof pro drug forms thereof and salts of pro drug forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

The compounds of Formula I according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK and are therefore useful as diuretic and or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore the compounds are useful for treatment or prophylaxis of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly an object of the instant invention is to provide a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a ROMK inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula I can be examined for example in any of the activity assays described below. Another object is to provide a method for causing diuresis natriuresis or both comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof.

Due to their activity as diuretics and natriuretic agents this invention further provides the use of compounds of Formula I in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension heart failure both acute and chronic also known as congestive heart failure and or other conditions resulting from excessive salt and water retention. Compounds of Formula I are useful for treating both primary essential and secondary hypertension. Hypertensive conditions include but are not limited to systolic hypertension isolated systolic hypertension diastolic hypertension isolated diastolic hypertension renovascular hypertension endocrine disorder hypertension including hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma malignant hypertension resistant hypertension hypertension in obesity diabetes metabolic syndrome hypertension in heart failure hypertension in pregnancy and accelerated hypertension and prehypertension associated with any of these conditions. It further includes the use of the compounds of Formula I in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH cardiovascular disease diabetes endothelial dysfunction diastolic dysfunction stable and unstable angina pectoris thromboses restenosis myocardial infarction stroke cardiac insufficiency pulmonary hypertonia atherosclerosis hepatic cirrhosis ascitis pre eclampsia cerebral edema nephropathy nephrotic syndrome acute and chronic kidney insufficiency hypercalcemia Dent s disease Meniere s disease edetamous states and other conditions for which a diuretic would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention can be administered to a patient having or at risk of having one or more conditions for which a diuretic would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.

In general compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which when tested have an ICof 5 M or less preferably 1 M or less and more preferably 0.25 M or less in at least one of the following assays 1 the RbEfflux Assay 2 the Thallium Flux Assay 3 the Electrophysiology Assay. These assays are described in more detail further below.

The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is as is customary to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated and also on the sex age weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient including a course of therapy lasting days months years or the life of the patient.

In general a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg kg preferably 0.001 to 30 mg kg in particular 0.001 to 10 mg kg in each case mg per kg of bodyweight is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or in particular when larger amounts are administered can be divided into several for example two three or four individual doses and may be for example but not limited to 0.1 mg 0.25 mg 0.5 mg 0.75 mg 1 mg 1.25 mg 2 mg 2.5 mg 5 mg 10 mg 20 mg 40 mg 50 mg 75 mg 100 mg etc. on a daily basis. In some cases depending on the individual response it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.

The term patient includes animals preferably mammals and especially humans who use the instant active agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long term complications from a disease or medical condition.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment of hypertension and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention and reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.

In the methods of treatment of this invention the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as for example orally parenterally or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections intravenous intramuscular intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills tablets or capsules.

Accordingly this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For oral use the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills tablets troches lozenges aqueous or oily suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions hard or soft capsules or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents flavoring agents coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate sodium carbonate lactose mannitol calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents for example corn starch or alginic acid binding agents for example starch gelatin or acacia and lubricating agents for example magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc.

Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives for example wetting agents stabilizers emulsifiers dispersants preservatives sweeteners colorants flavorings aromatizers thickeners diluents buffer substances solvents solubilizers agents for achieving a depot effect salts for altering the osmotic pressure coating agents or antioxidants.

Oral immediate release and time controlled release dosage forms may be employed as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.

Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol PEGs and ethanol or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil for example arachis oil olive oil sesame oil or coconut oil or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent for example beeswax hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents for example glycerol propylene glycol sorbitol or sucrose.

The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier is comprised of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Furthermore a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting ROMK for causing diuresis and or natriuresis and or for treating preventing or reducing the risk for any of the medical conditions described herein in dosage amounts described herein.

The amount of active compound of Formula I and or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be for example but not limited to from 0.1 to 200 mg preferably from 0.1 to 50 mg per dose on a free acid free base weight basis but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition and potency of the active ingredient it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid free base weight basis.

The compounds of Formula I inhibit ROMK. On account of this property apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on ROMK is intended and also for diagnostic purposes for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.

One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. The additional active agent or agents is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent or agents that is active in the body including pro drugs that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration which is different from the compound of Formula I and also includes free acid free base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents when such forms are sold commercially or are otherwise chemically possible. Generally any suitable additional active agent or agents including but not limited to anti hypertensive agents additional diuretics anti atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound anti diabetic agents and or anti obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation a fixed dose drug combination or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents co administration of the separate active agents . Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors e.g alacepril benazepril captopril ceronapril cilazapril delapril enalapril enalaprilat fosinopril imidapril lisinopril moveltipril perindopril quinapril ramipril spirapril temocapril or trandolapril angiotensin II receptor antagonists also known as angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs e.g. losartan i.e. COZAAR valsartan candesartan olmesartan telmesartan eprosartan irbesartan and any of these drugs used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide such as HYZAAR diuretics e.g. hydrochlorothiazide HCTZ potassium sparing diuretics such as amiloride HCl spironolactone epleranone triamterene each with or without HCTZ neutral endopeptidase inhibitors e.g. thiorphan and phosphoramidon aldosterone antagonists aldosterone synthase inhibitors renin inhibitors e.g. urea derivatives of di and tri peptides See U.S. Pat.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased made from known procedures or as otherwise illustrated.

Compounds of the formula I are prepared in a variety of ways as exemplified by the examples below. Some frequently applied routes to the compounds of the formula I are described by the Schemes below.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased made from known procedures or as otherwise illustrated. The Ar group shown in the below schemes is a substituted aromatic or substituted heterocyclic group as previously defined. The A group shown in the schemes is O OH halogen OS O R OP O R OR or SRwhere Ris Calkyl or Ar. Z is B Z . X is OH NHor SH. n is 0 or 1. r represents a reduction step.

The preparation of the compounds I1 and I2 is detailed in Scheme 1. Treatment of the electrophile 1 1 such as aryl halide or trifluoromethanesulfonate with 1 Boc piperazine 1 2 or similar olefin metal catalyzed coupling conditions such as standard Heck conditions including trans dichlorobis tri o tolylphosphine palladium II and triethylamine affords the olefin product 1 3. The Boc protecting group Greene T. Wuts P. G. M. John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York N.Y. 1991 of 1 3 can be removed under acidic conditions such as with TFA or HCl. Alternatively the piperazine may be protected with another protecting group such as Cbz and subsequently removed by hydrogenolysis. Subsequent alkylation of 1 4 with an electrophile 1 5 examples include alkyl halides mesylates trifluoromethanesulfonates etc. or aldehydes in the presence of appropriate base such as triethylamine or reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride gives rise to compounds I1. The olefin of I1 can be reduced to the corresponding saturated alkyl compound with standard reducing conditions such as heterogenous palladium hydrogenation to yield I2.

Additionally compounds of formulas I3 and I4 can also be prepared by the sequence detailed in Scheme 2. Treatment previously described intermediate 1 4 with the appropriate electrophile 2 1 such as carboxylic acid or ester under standard amide bond forming conditions such as EDC HOBt triethylamine gives rise to I3. Alternatively the piperazine may be protected with another protecting group such as Cbz. Similarly the olefin may be reduced to the saturated alkyl compound using standard reducing conditions such as heterogenous palladium hydrogenation to yield I4.

The preparation of compounds of formulas I5 and I6 begins with the addition of the alkylmetal species generated from trimethylsilylacetylene 3 1 such as the alkyllithium generated from treatment with n butyllithium to commercially available tert butyl 4 piperidone 1 carboxylate 3 2 to produce the alcohol 3 3 Scheme 3 . The Boc group can be removed under acidic conditions to afford piperidine 3 4 which can then be coupled to electrophile 3 5 via standard amide bond forming conditions described above in Scheme 2. The resulting terminal alkyne 3 6 can then undergo metal catalyzed cross coupling such as Sonogashira conditions with the appropriate aryl or heteroaryl halide trifluoromethanesulfonate phosphonate or other reactive intermediate to furnish I 5. Reduction or partial reduction of the alkyne in I 5 such as under heterogeneous metal catalysed hydrogenation can provide I 6.

The related piperidines I 7 can be prepared following the method detailed in Scheme 4. Treatment of 3 3 as described above in Scheme 3 with the appropriate aryl or heteroaryl halide trifluoromethanesulfonate phosphonate or other reactive intermediate under metal catalyzed cross coupling such as Sonogashira conditions affords 4 1. The Boc group can be removed under acidic conditions to afford piperidine 4 2 which can then be coupled to electrophile 4 3 examples include alkyl halides mesylates trifluoromethanesulfonates etc. or aldehydes in the presence of appropriate base such as triethylamine or reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to furnish piperidine 4 4. Reduction or partial reduction of the alkyne in 4 4 such as under heterogeneous metal catalysed hydrogenation can provide I 7.

Piperidines I 8 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 5. Treatment of the heteroatom containing piperidines 5 1 such as thio amino hydroxyl thiomethyl amino methyl or hydroxylmethyl with a heteroaryl halide trifluoromethanesulfonate phosphonate or other reactive intermediate under the appropriate metal catalyzed or base conditions such as Ullman coupling palladium or copper catalysis or triethylamine or cesium carbonate provides the piperazines 5 2. The Boc group can be removed under acidic conditions to afford piperidine 5 3 which can then be coupled to electrophile 5 4 examples include alkyl halides mesylates trifluoromethanesulfonates etc. or aldehydes in the presence of appropriate base such as triethylamine or reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to furnish piperidine I 8.

Alternatively piperadines I 9 containing an amide linkage can be prepared starting from intermediate 5 1. Coupling of 5 1 with appropriate electrophiles 3 5 via standard amide bond forming conditions can be carried out as described above in Scheme 2 to furnish I 9.

Several assays may be used to measure functional inhibition of the ROMK channel by compounds of the instant invention. One primary assay that can be used is a functional Rbefflux assay that measures the ability of ROMK to permeate Rb in the absence or presence of test compound. Under control conditions cells loaded with Rb and incubated in Rb free medium display a time dependent efflux of the isotope the rate of which depends on number of functional channels. When cells are incubated in the presence of a channel inhibitor efflux of Rb is prevented in a concentration dependent manner and ICvalues of inhibition by compounds can be accurately determined. This assay has been established with cell lines expressing either human rat or dog ROMK channels and can operate in 96 or 384 well format. Importantly the human rat and dog Rb efflux assays can be carried out in the presence of up to 100 serum allowing therefore an accurate estimation of the effect of protein binding on the inhibitory activity of compounds of interest. Another ROMK functional assay makes use of the ability of thallium to permeate through open ROMK channels and increase the fluorescence of a dye previously loaded into the cells. Under control conditions cells loaded with dye and exposed to thallium containing medium display a time dependent increase in fluorescence the rate of which depends on number of functional channels. When cells are incubated in the presence of a channel inhibitor the increase in fluorescence is attenuated in a concentration dependent manner and ICvalues of inhibition by compounds can be accurately determined. This assay has been established with cell lines expressing either human or rat ROMK channels and operates in 384 well format. Another assay for evaluation of the compounds of the instant invention and for evaluation of mechanism of action of compounds of Formula I relies on the measurement of the electrical current that is generated as potassium permeates through the channel. For these electrophysiological experiments three different platforms IonWorks QPatch or manual patch clamp are used depending on the experimental protocol under consideration. IonWorks operates in a 384 well format and allows accurate determination of ICvalues for inhibitors. Examples of compounds of the present invention listed above all had potencies of at least 1 M or lower in one or more of the three assays described herein.

The following Thallium Flux Assay and or the Rb Efflux Assay were performed on the final product compounds in the Examples.

HEK293 cells stably expressing hROMK hK1.1 were grown at 37 C. in a 10 COhumidified incubator in complete growth media Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with non essential amino acids Penicillin Streptomycin Glutamine G418 and FBS. At 80 confluency media was aspirated from the flask and rinsed with 10 ml Calcium Magnesium free PBS. 5 ml of 1 trypsin prepared in Ca Mg Free PBS was added to T 225 flask and flask returned to 37 C. COincubator for 2 3 minutes. To dislodge the cell the side of the flask was gently banged by hand. Cells were completely triturated and then transferred to 25 ml complete media and centrifuged at 1 500 rpm for 6 min followed by resuspension in complete growth media and cell concentration determined. For typical re seeding 4E6 cells T 225 flask attained 80 confluency in 4 days. Under ideal growth conditions and appropriate tissue culture practices this cell line was stable for 40 45 passages.

The ROMK channel functional thallium flux assay was performed in 384 wells using the FLIPR Tetra instrument. HEK hKir1.1 cells were seeded in Poly D Lysine microplates and kept in a 37 C. 10 COincubator overnight. On the day of the experiment the growth media was replaced with the FluxOR reagent loading buffer and incubated protected from light at ambient temperature 23 25 C. for 90 min. The loading buffer was replaced with assay buffer test compound followed by 30 min incubation at ambient temperature where the Thallium Potassium stimulant was added to the microplate.

The fluorescence intensity of wells containing 3 M of a standard control ROMK inhibitor of the present invention was used to define the ROMK sensitive component of thallium flux. Fluorescence in the presence of test compounds was normalized to control values to provide fluorescence change. ICvalues represented the concentration of compound that inhibits 50 of the ROMK thallium flux signal.

Normally a control compound was included to support that the assay was giving consistent results compared to previous measurements although the control was not required to obtain the results for the test compounds. The control was any compound of Formula I of the present invention preferably with an ICpotency of less than 1 M in this assay. Alternatively the control was another compound outside the scope of Formula I that had an ICpotency in this assay of less than 1

Cells were incubated in 37 C. 10 COincubator overnight. On the day of the experiment the media was removed and cells washed with low K assay buffer. Rb efflux was initiated after addition of assay buffer test compound followed by 35 min incubation at room temperature. ROMK sensitive component of efflux was defined in the presence of 10 mM BaCl. Assay buffer was removed and transferred to a plate and cells were solubilized in the presence of SDS. Radioactivity associated with assay and cell plate was determined.

Radioactivity associated with the assay plate was normalized to the total radioactivity assay cell plates to provide efflux under each condition. efflux in the presence of 10 mM BaClwas subtracted from each experimental point to provide the ROMK sensitive component of Rb efflux. In the absence of test compound this number corresponded to 100 control efflux. ICvalues represented the concentration of compound that inhibits 50 of ROMK efflux. Normally a control compound was included to support that the assay was giving consistent results compared to previous measurements although the control is not required to obtain results for the test compounds. The control was any compound of Formula I of the present invention preferably with an ICpotency of less than 1 M in this assay or the control was another compound outside the scope of Formula I that has an ICpotency in this assay of less than 1 M.
