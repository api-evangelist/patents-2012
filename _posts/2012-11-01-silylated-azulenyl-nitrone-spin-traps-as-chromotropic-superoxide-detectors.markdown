Increasing evidence of involvement of superoxide radical anion O. as a mediator of various pathological diseases and its importance in physiological processes led to the development of methods for detecting superoxide radical anion over the past decades. By far the most commonly used probes include cyclic nitrones hydroethidine nitro blue tetrazolium and other chemiluminescent and fluorescent species have received a criticism for various reasons.To overcome the existing problem associated with these probes an effective approach a selective mechanism based colorimetric detection of superoxide anion has been developed by using a novel silylated azulenyl nitrone spin trap. The synthesized nitrones were found to trap superoxide anion and hence can be the potential biomarkers for superoxide production.

Role of Free Radicals in Various Diseases

Oxidative stresses due to free radicals have been implicated in various pathological conditions. The involvement of free radicals in disease is triggered by various factors such as genetic environmental and disturbance of metabolic systems. Free radicals produced in mitochondria are widely believed to be the major cause of manifestation of a pro oxidative shift in the plasma thiol disulfide redox state which impairs glucose tolerance. These conditions are generally observed in cancerand diabetes.As in the other cases the enhanced activity of NAD P H oxidase and xanthine oxidase are the major cause of ROS generation derived from superoxide anion. These conditions are normally observed in chronic inflammationand ischemia reperfusion injury respectively.

An alteration of cellular thiol disulfide redox state as a result of oxidative stress has been found in many cancer cells. Damage to DNA occurs due to free radical induced permanent modification of genetic materials thereby leading to cell mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. An increased level of DNA damage has also been found in tumors which suggests the involvement of oxidative stress in the etiology of cancer. If DNA is severely damaged then affected cells are selectively eliminated by the process called apoptosis. Apoptosis a normal biological process is a programmed cell death that destroys the damaged cells that could otherwise cause a threat to the integrity of organisms by leading to many morphological changes.However uncontrolled apoptosis can lead to the destruction of healthy cells.The consequences of DNA damage are arrest or induction of transcription induction of signal transcription pathways genomic instability and replication error all of them are associated with carcinogenesis.The formation of the DNA oxidation product 8 oxo 7 hydro 29 deoxyguanosine 8 oxo dG has been studied most extensively as a potential biomarker of carcinogenesis because it is easily detectable. 8 oxo dG was first detected in urine by Shigenaga et alTobacco smoking is one of the sources of carcinogenic reactive oxygen species.

Free radicals are also involved in diabetes mellitus.Hyperglycemia is the common characteristic of both type 1 diabetes mellitus insulin dependent and type 2 diabetes mellitus non insulin dependent . Hyperglycemia is the condition in which an excessive amount of glucose is circulated in the blood plasma. Increased glucose levels are shown to increase the production of free radicals from various sources. The major site of superoxide anion formation in diabetes is mitochondrial complex IIwhich is different from the sites mitochondrial complex I and the ubiquinone complex III that generate superoxide anion under normal conditions. Glucose auto oxidation has been shown to produce superoxide anion in diabetic patientsThe advanced glycation end AGE products are the result of glucose oxidation which interact with specific cell surface binding proteins with subsequent generation of ROS.The increased level of ROS may cause the development of diabetic complications such as accelerated atherosclerosisand other vascular pathologies.

Various inflammatory diseases are associated with the elevated production of ROS.Atherosclerosis is one of the chronic inflammatory diseases that is characterized by hardening and thickening of the arterial walls that develop in the inner coat.In the presence of hyperlipidemia oxidative stress may activate the genes that induce an inflammatory response to the vascular endothelium. The injured endothelial cells then stimulate the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the arterial walls which bind oxidized low density lipoprotein LDL resulting in abnormal macrophages that subsequently undergo apoptosis. The massive apoptosis of macrophages causes the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.Moreover experimental data shows that hypertension may cause an intensification of atherosclerosis.

A role for oxidative stress in hypertension has been supported by the study of an animal model by Vaziri et alvia in vivo glutathione depletion. Similarly a potential causative role for oxidative stress is also found in patients with essential hypertension.The mechanism that seems to contribute to hypertension is increased generation of superoxide anion in the vessel wall followed by the formation of peroxinitrite anion which in turn increases vasoconstriction.In vivo studies in animals demonstrated that angiotensin II is the main factor that is involved in the oxidative stress that leads to a chronic high blood pressure.

It is suggested that oxidative stress is also involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. Among the other organs brain and nervous tissue suffer more oxidative damages. The reason for this is the large amount of oxygen consumption in a relatively small tissue mass brain and a high content of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids. Brain has a high iron contentthat can be released as ions during brain injury and these ions are capable of catalyzing free radical reactions resulting in HO. formation which thereby accelerates lipid peroxidation and autoxidation of neurotransmitters.

Alzheimer s disease AD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of higher cognitive functions and extensive neuronal loss. Two pathological features found in AD patients are the accumulation of amyloid plagues amyloid peptide in the brain and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads.A progressive cerebral accumulation of amyloid peptide is the major event in the development of Alzheimer s disease. This accumulation causes neurofibrillary damage in neurons neurotransmitter defects and neuronal death. These phenomena are the major cause of loss of cognitive functions.The evidence of increased lipid peroxidation and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids content increased protein and DNA oxidation increased formation of 4 hydroxynonenal product of lipid peroxidaiton in AD ventricular fluids the presence of advanced glycation end products malondialdehyde nitrotyrosine and peroxynitrite in neurofibrillary tangles supports the involvement of oxidative stress in the brains of Alzheimer s disease brain victims.The significant amount of lipid peroxidation has been implicated by the increased level of 4 hydroxynonenal in the postmortem cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer s disease patients.Individuals with Down s syndrome have been shown to develop Alzheimer s disease as they get older.Down s syndrome is a genetic disease due to the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 that leads to mental retardation. There is evidence of overexpression of Cu ZnSOD in Down s syndrome that may result in increased production of hydrogen peroxide.Overproduction of Cu ZnSOD in transfected cells appears to promote increased lipid peroxidation.

Parkinson s disease PD is characterized by a problem in controlling movement that includes slow movement of foot and hand when they are at rest and muscle rigidity. PD is associated with a selective loss of neurons in a part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra.The cells of the substantia nigra produce dopamine a neurotransmitter chemical messenger between brain and nerve cells which communicates with cells in another region of the brain. It is believed that oxidative stress is an initiator of dopaminergic cell degeneration which is also associated with the presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and elsewhere based on the postmortem.Lewy bodies are small spherical proteins which affect the brain s normal functions and interrupt the action of important chemical messengers.

Similarly in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS motor neurons are the main targets affected in the motor cortex spinal cord and brain stemwhich leads to muscle tone impairment respiratory failure paralysis and often death. Multiple mutations are associated with familial ALS. Studies show that 20 of familial ALS patients carry mutations in the Cu ZnSOD gene suggesting the involvement of free radicals.One hypothesis concerning the etiology of ALS is that metals at the active sites of mutant Cu ZnSODs allow these enzymes to catalyse oxidation reactions via peroxynitrite generated nitrating species.Several lines of transgenic mice overexpressing mutant Cu ZnSOD have shown to develop a motor neuron disease whose pathology and mode of progression resemble familial ALS patients. Gurney Becker et al. used azulenyl nitrone AZN to suggest oxidative stress in SOD mutant transgenic mice.Recently Siddque s team discovered mutation in ubiquilin 2 gene in the brains and in the spinal cords of ALS victims.The mutant ubiquilin 2 gene causes the accumulation of damaged protein contributing several forms of ALS.

Other neurodegenerative diseases contributed to oxidative stress may include Huntington s disease multiple sclerosis neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosesand Friedreich s ataxia.

Injury to heart brain lungs intestine liver kidney and skeletal muscle resulting from ischemic reperfusion may present in a variety of clinical conditions such as organ transplantation stroke myocardial infractions and many other situations.On the basis of hospital discharge records 5 million patients 16.2 were diagnosed with ischemic cardiovascular events and such events were the major cause of death 38.7 in the United States.Occurrence of tissue damage is attributed to the large amount of ROS production during ischemia reperfusion.Under the ischemic condition oxygen deprivation xanthine dehydrogenase is converted into xanthine oxidase that utilizes oxygen which in turn depletes ATP leading to the accumulation of the purine catabolite hypoxanthine. Upon subsequent reperfusion reoxygenation xanthine oxidase uses the influx of oxygen to oxidize hypoxanthine into xanthine with rapid generation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide.Treatment with a synthetic SOD mimetic has been shown to attenuate tissue damage in a rat model of ischemia reperfusion injury.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a breathing disorder among adults characterized by an abnormal pause in breathing during sleep.The resulting repeated hypoxia and reoxygenation is similar event to the conditions of ischemia reperfusion. Untreated and severely affected individuals often develop cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease arterial hypertension and cerebrovascular diseasethat are associated with increased mortality.The involvement of free radicals in obstructive sleep apnea which could be the cause of the associated cardiovascular events has been implicated by the detection of increased production of superoxide anion from polymorphonuclear neutrophils in affected patients after exposure to various stumuli.

Most of the free radical mediated diseases such as neurodegenerative cardiovascular and some common forms of cancer increase with age. Aging is a process of progressive loss in the efficiency of physical and cognitive functions of an organism after the reproductive phase of life. The fact that free radicals cause deleterious damage to cells over time which results in aging was proposed by Harman et al.Several studies also support his theory by showing progressive generation of free radicals and almost exponential increases in accumulation of oxidatively damage proteins lipids and DNAs during aging.Mitochondria are the primary sites of generation of oxidants during the aging process. Much of the oxidized DNAs especially the nuclear DNA are repaired by the cell but the mitochondrial DNA receives only low repair activity.Over time the damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulates and slowly shuts down mitochondria causing cell to age and eventually die.

The objectives of this research are to design and synthesize various novel silylated azulenyl nitrones as spin traps for chromotropic detection of superoxide anion radical to study their chemical properties and to study their reaction with superoxide anion. Towards this aim the following nitrones were pursued.

Nitrones are known as good candidates to react with superoxide anion by spin trapping yielding detectable diamagnetic spin adducts. A silyl substituent a non polar oxophilic electropositive group has a strong propensity to react with an oxygen anion such as that which is present in a superoxide spin adduct. Hence the presence of a nearby silyl group in nitrone molecules is expected to confer distinctive reaction pathways with superoxide that are not available in traditional nitrones. Moreover due to colorimetric properties of azulene compounds the end products of the spin trapping would likely yield characteristically colored molecules. Hence the following silylated azulenyl nitrones 22 23 and 24 are putatively equipped specifically for superoxide anion detection by likely yielding characteristically colored end products with a characteristic UV VIS spectral profile upon reaction with superoxide anion.

Mitochondria are the major sites of superoxide production. To detect mitochondrial superoxide the chemical structure of compound 24 was modified by incorporation of a guanylhydrazone moiety. Since guanylhydrazones are protonated at physiological pH the attachment of this moiety to compound 24 is expected to increase the permeability of compound 25 into the mitochondrial membrane to reach sites of superoxide anion generation. The structure of compound 25 is given below 

Nitrones have been shown to exhibit an efficient antioxidant activity in vitro and likely in vivo by trapping reactive free radicals.Due to their spin trapping properties numerous nitrones have been developed for detecting superoxide anion in biological systems in assays that require ESR spectroscopy. Superoxide adducts thereby formed were found to be very unstable and this reduced persistence complicates their detection by ESR. The research project described here was to synthesize silylated azulenyl nitrones for superoxide detection that could selectively yield a characteristic product after the oxidation reaction with superoxide anion which could be detected by UV VIS and simple colorimetric techniques without using ESR spectroscopy.

The first synthetic effort in the preparation of ethylated azulenylsilane nitrone 22 involved four efficient steps starting from commercially available 3 hexyne as illustrated in scheme 1. Allenylsilane 27 was prepared in one step employing a metalation reaction according to the method reported in the literature.The metalation reaction was carried out by the addition of 3 hexyne to a cooled sec BuLi solution in THF and left for 3 hr which formed the monolithiated product. The metalation mixture was then silylated by treatment with excess tert butyldimethylsilylchloride at 70 C. and then left overnight at room temperature 10 . Danheiser and Becker reported the preparation of several azulenylsilanes via cyclization reaction between allenylsilanes and tropylium cations.Following the same protocol azulenylsilane 28 was synthesized by addition of 2.2 equiv. of tropylium tetrafluoroborate and 3.3 equiv. of poly 4 vinylpyridine in acetonitrile 53 which underwent 3 2 annulation involving rearrangement and cyclization. Attempted oxidation of the 1 ethyl and 3 methy group of azulene 28 by treatment with 4 equiv. of 2 3 dichloro 5 6 dicyanobenzoquinone DDQ failed to give the expected ketoaldehyde 29 . Instead the unexpected product ethyl aldehyde 30 in 53 yield and the by product alcohol 31 were obtained based on NMR data. It is obvious from the product that partial oxidation might have taken place due to steric hindrance of the silyl group and its substituents. It was possible to optimize the yield of ethylaldehyde 30 from 53 to 70 using only 2 equiv. of DDQ for oxidation reaction. In one attempt during the preparation of aldehyde 30 approximately 2.5 of bis aldehyde 32 was also recovered. Condensation of ethylaldehyde 30 with N tert butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 45 C. ethylated azulenylsilane nitrone 22 in 47 yield.

Synthetically bis aldehyde 32 was a desirable intermediate for the synthesis of other compounds. For example compound 32 would prove to be a useful precursor for the preparation of other nitrones that might have significance in trapping superoxide anion vide infra . Keeping this in mind efforts were made to synthesize 32 efficiently.

In an attempt to synthesize mononitrone 23 from the red aldehyde 32 readily available acetaldehyde 33 was used as the starting material. N tert butylimine 35 was prepared from addition of acetaldehyde to tert butylimine 34 at 0 C. without any solvent followed by distillation according to the modified method of Chancelas illustrated in scheme 2. The N tert butylimine 35 was then deprotonated with LDA and silyated by using TBDMSCl followed by repeated deprotonation with BuLi and methylation with iodomethane which afforded mono methylated silylimine 36 in a one pot process reported by Tietze.The methylated silylimine 36 is quite unstable and was easily hydrolyzed by washing through a silica gel column using petroleum ether and ethylacetate which gave aldehyde 37 . A Corey Fuchs reaction involving the treatment of aldehyde 37 with a mixture of triphenylphosphine and tetrabromomethane in CHClat 0 C. provided dibromoalkene 38 via a Wittig like reaction.

Subsequently treatment of dibromoalkene 38 with BuLi followed by exposure to iodomethane yielded alkynylsilane 39 via the generation of a bromoalkyne intermediate that formed in a process consisting of dehydrohalogenation and metal halogen exchange. A 3 2 annulation reaction between alkyneylsilane 39 and tropylium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile in the presence of excess poly 4 vinylpyridine resulted in formation of blue azulenylsilane 40 .Oxidation of two methyl groups of azulenylsilane 40 with four equivalents of DDQin the presence of acetone afforded bis aldehyde 32 which was converted into the ethylated azulenylsilane mononitrone 23 by reaction with two equivalents of N tert butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 45 C.

Unfortunately the reaction failed to give the expected product when nitrone 23 was treated with 4 equivalent of DMAD. Instead the intermediate product 43 was obtained illustrated in scheme 4 which was identified by NMR data. Failure to achieve the formation of triester 43 suggests that only one equivalent of DMAD had been consumed in a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction to afford cyaloaddition adduct 43 which thereafter failed to open the isoxazoline ring to rearrange to azomethine ylide before a second cycloaddition reaction with another equivalent of DMAD could occur.

The condensation reaction between aminofuran derivative 50 and N tert butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 45 C. afforded aminofuran nitrone 49.

With the successful synthesis of aminofuran nitrone an attempt was made to improve hydrophilicity by modifying compound 49 in order to detect superoxide generated in mitochondria. The incorporation of a guanylhydrazone moiety was sought as a means of increasing hydrophilicity. Since a guanylhydrazone is positively charged at physiological pH it may traverse across cellular membranes and therefore aid in the accumulation of nitrone into mitochondria.

Azulenylsilane dinitrone 55 was found to be a useful precursor for the synthesis of other nitrones which allowed incorporation of other substituents on either the 1 or 3 position via a cycloaddition approach vide infra . A simple condensation reaction between mononitrone 23 and three equivalents of N tert butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 45 C. yielded azulenylsilane dinitrone 55. It was also possible to prepare this dinitrone in 33 yield from bis aldehyde 32 by using five equivalent of N tert butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride as outlined in the scheme 8.

One of the possibilities to introduce an electron withdrawing cyano moiety to the azulenylsilane nitrone is a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition approach using dinitrone 55. Coates who has studied the regioselective cycloaddition between and cyclic nitrones with various alkene nitriles and alkyne nitriles demonstrated successful formation of cycloadducts using phenylpropiolonitrile.Using the same protocol isoxazoline nitrone 24 was prepared regio specifically from dinitrone 55 and phenylpropiolonitrile in benzene at 50 C. for 6 days scheme 9 .

Initially the product nitrone 24 was thought to undergo ring opening of the isoxazoline system to produce enamine derivative 56 on basis of an the earlier study.But such rearrangement was not observed in this case figure 14 .

Isoxazoline nitrone 24 seemed to be a promising agent for in vitro superoxide detection. However the drawback to this compound is that it is not a lipophilic cation

Aldehyde 61 was prepared in two steps as shown in scheme 11. According to the method reported by Wang cyanation of one terminal acetylene of 1 3 diethynylbenzene 62 using two equivalents of cuprous cyanide in the presence of TMSCl water and a catalytic amount of sodium iodide at 50 C. afforded nitrile derivative 63. The crucial factor in this cyanation process was the composition of solvent. Thus DMSO and a co solvent CHCN should be in the ratio of 3 1. Sonogashira coupling of compound 63 with 3 iodobenzaldehdein THF using tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium at room temperature for 24 hour provided 3 3 Formyl phenylethynyl phenyl propyne nitrile 61. Treatment of one equivalent of nitrile 61 with dinitrone 55 in benzene at 50 C. engendered 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition that provided adduct 64. A condensation reaction between compound 64 with aminoguanidine hydrochloride in the presence of triethylamine in pyridine at 45 C. afforded guanylhydrazone nitrone 25 scheme 12 .

Unfortunately nitrone 25 despite the presence of the polar guanylhydrazone is found to be poorly water soluble but could still be mitochondriotropic . Another possibility of making mitochondria targeted compounds involves the synthesis of salts of nitrones 65 and 66. The presence of the aldehyde group in compound 64 is ideal for such a purpose. Nitrone 65 could theoretically be prepared by treatment of aldehyde 64 with Girard s reagent as shown in figure 15. Alternatively transformation of aldehyde 64 into salt 66 could proceed in several steps as illustrated in figure 16. First a reduction reaction converts aldehyde 64 into the alcohol derivative which upon treatment with tosylchloride would give the corresponding tosylate congener. Subsequently Sreaction of the tosylate with triphenylphosphine would afford the potential mitochondriotropic phosphonium salt 66.

After the successful synthesis and characterization of several nitrones experiments were conducted to test the properties and potential diagnostic application of these novel nitrones for detecting superoxide radical anion.

The first attempt to detect superoxide involved reaction of nitrone 22 with potassium superoxide in the presence of 18 crown 6 in benzene at room temperatureNo reaction was observed when nitrone 22 was treated with a solution of one to five equivalents of potassium superoxide and one equivalent of crown ether dissolved in benzene. Thus the amounts of potassium superoxide and crown ether were increased to 5 equivalents. Still no product was observed. The result could be due to the fact that not enough superoxide radical anion was present because of poor solubility of potassium superoxide. Therefore 20 equivalents of potassium superoxide and crown ether were directly treated with nitrone 22. These conditions gave a product in very low yield which was impossible to identify. Finally nitrone 22 was directly treated using 6 equivalents of potassium superoxide. In this case oxidation reaction was conveniently followed by TLC by monitoring the appearance of a less polar orange product which was analyzed by H NMR spectroscopy. The product was identified as aldehyde 67 by observing the aldehyde proton signal and the up field shifting of the ethyl signal of the azulene ring.

Formation of a ketone from analogous reaction between a ketonitrones and potassium superoxide has been previously reported.Thus diphenylene N phenylnitrone 68 was treated with superoxide and ketone 69 was found as a major product as shown in figure 18. Interestingly aldehyde 67 was found to be very unstable because it decomposed while another orange product was started to appear as the reaction proceeded. Due to difficulty in purification identification of the second orange product was not possible. The H NMR data showed no aldehyde proton and a low resolution mass peak at MH of 663 was observed for this second orange product. The possible explanation could be that the aldehyde product is very liable to oxidation with superoxide anion and oxidized faster than nitrone 22 to form the second product.

On the basis of the above result expected aldehyde 67 was observed as an initial orange product which is supported by the proposed mechanism of oxidation of nitrone with superoxide figure 19 . Superoxide radical adds to nitrone 22 by radical addition to form intermediate nitroxide anion 70. Since silicon has high affinity towards oxygen intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the anionic oxygen on silicon gives rise to an unstable pentavalent intermediate71 which subsequently undergoes rearrangement by migrating the azulenyl group to the adjacent oxygen as an alkoxide ion departs. Finally collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate provides aldehyde 67. Such an oxidative desilylation process was initially described by Tamao and Kumada.

Information regarding the paramagnetic superoxide spin adduct an intermediate presumed to be formed from the reaction of nitrone 22 with superoxide anion remained unknown since ESR measurement was not available. However similar to the superoxide spin adducts of the conventional acyclic nitrones such a superoxide spin adduct would be expected to be highly unstable at room temperature. Grulke et al in his ESR spin trapping study of DMPO with metmyoglobin and hydrogen peroxide at varying temperature has found the nitrone peroxyl spin adduct unstable even at 0 C.

The detection of superoxide with azulenysilane mononitrone 23 was based on the previous method as described vida supra . Six equivalents of potassium superoxide were used as before. As mentioned earlier the previous reaction was monitored by observing an orange product on TLC. In this case the reaction mixture turned completely from green to orange in 90 min. Based on the previous mechanism it was expected to obtain the end product bis aldehyde 72. However H NMR spectral information of the orange end product indicated the loss of the silyl group and presence of only the mono aldehyde. The low resolution mass spectrum detected a MH of 448. Unfortunately it was not possible to purify enough for the NMR characterization. Hence the structure identification of end product remained unsolved. It is believed that the superoxide spin adduct that formed was unstable and fragmented into another compound rather than the expected one. The loss of the silyl group could result after rearrangement via a nucleophilic attack on silicon by a second superoxide anion since an excess of superoxide anion was used and due to the high affinity of silicon towards oxygen.

The unidentified end product from superoxide radical anion with nitrone 23 led us to synthesize an analogue the isoxazoline azulenylsilanenitrone 24 and test it for its possible utility in superoxide detection. Using the same method as described earlier superoxide was solubilized in benzene by employing in acrown ether. The only difference in this case was the use of three equivalents of potassium superoxide instead of six equivalents. The green reaction mixture was completely turned into orange solution. As in the previous case aldehyde product 73 was expected to be formed. But surprisingly NMR analysis showed the absence of an aldehydic proton and a molecular mass of 469 was detected which did not match with the aldehyde product. A high resolution mass spectrum of the major product was obtained and it was found to possess a molecular formula of CHNO. With HRMS and NMR spectral analyses the orange product was identified as amide 74.

The proposed mechanism for the formation of amide 74 from the spin trapping of superoxide radical anion by nitrone 24 is shown below. The addition of superoxide radical to the double bond of nitrone 24 leads to radical anion 75 which then suffers nucleophilic attack by the negatively charged oxygen on the silicon to give an intermediate with a six membered ring compound 76 .Then subsequent desilylation by migrating the azulenyl group to the adjacent oxygen atom transforms 76 into anion 77 in analogy to the work of Tamao and Kumada.Rearrangement involving a nucleophilic attack of the anionic oxygen on silicon leaves the negative charge on oxygen at the 2 position which in turn undergoes a nucleophilic attack on the nitrile moiety thus resulting in the six membered ring in compound 78. This step might also result in the rapid opening of the isoxazoline ring. Meanwhile oxygen radical may be reduced by disproportionation or reduced by ascorbic acid in a biological system to form the corresponding hydroxylamine. Dehydration followed by desilylation affords amide 74. In

addition to amide 74 a trace of orange compound 79 was also obtained which is identified by MS data 584 MH . The formation of 79 suggests a divergent mechanism that might have taken place in the reaction. Contrary to the first mechanism the second mechanism pathway might have involved addition of one molecule of superoxide anion followed by dehydration to give 79.

The UV vis ultra visible absorption spectrum and fluorescence of chromotropic amide 74 was measured in ethanol. As shown in figure 24 the UV vis is indicated by the blue signal which consists of two strong absorbances in the range of 250 400 nm and one weak absorbance in the range of 400 500 nm. The fluorescence signal indicated by red signal was obtained by irradiating at the excitation wavelength 390 nm as shown in the spectrum. The wavelength dependence of the intensity of emitted light has been recorded at 490 nm emission . The quantum yield of amide was measured at 2.7 . These results suggest that compound 74 has fluorescence and this probe may possibly be employed to detect superoxide anion in biological system by identifying its orange fluorescence. This in addition to its chromotropic behavior may bring an advantage over conventional cyclic nitrones which require ESR for superoxide detection.

One of the advantages of fluorescence detection is the possibility of real time monitoring of the oxidation process.

Guanylhydrazone nitrone 25 is a congener of nitrone 24. Incorporation of guanylhydrazone moiety may make it mitochondriotropic and thereby render it useful to detect superoxide anion present in the mitochondria. As expected nitrone 25 has also shown to trap superoxide efficiently in analogy to the other aforementioned nitrones. Using the same method as described for the other nitrones nitrone 40 turned into brownish orange upon reaction with potassium superoxide. The brownish orange end product was isolated and identified as amide 80 using low resolution mass spectrum MH 654 which is analogous to the end product 74. In addition to amide 80 a trace of another orange product was also observed which is identified as amide 81 MH 768 analogous to amide 79.

Since nitrone 25 was poorly water soluble its solubility in an aqueous systems was examined using solutol HS 15. Solutol HS 15 is a non ionic solubilizer and emulsifying agent produced from 1 mole of 12 hydroxystearic acids and 15 moles of ethylene oxide. It provides excellent solubility to poorly soluble lipophilic molecules in water and hence it is used for formulation of drugs in the pharmaceuticals industry.

In this experiment as expected solutol HS 15 was found to increase the solubility of nitrone 25 in water. To prepare the concentration of 0.64 mg ml of nitrone 25 in 3 7 solutol HS 15 1 saline solution 1 ml of solutol HS 15 was heated until it turned into a clear liquid and cooled to room temperature. Meanwhile 2.1 mg of nitrone 25 was crushed to a fine powder and dissolved in 1 ml of clear solutol HS 15. It was then diluted with 2.3 ml of 1 saline solution in water with frequent shaking and warming. It was then cool to room temperature to obtained green solution. The green solution was kept in a freezer and found to be stable. The aqueous formulation of nitrone 25 with solutol HS 15 is believed to be amenable for mitochondrial superoxide detection and other biological studies.

Superoxide radical anion generation and its reactions in biological systems have received considerable attention because of the involvement of superoxide in physiological process as well as in the pathogenesis of various diseases. In biomedical research it is important to characterize the specific free radical and its exact role in diseases which will allow investigators to design molecular or pharmacological approaches to prevent or ameliorate free radical mediated maladies. But the direct detection of biologically generated superoxide radical anion the identification of its sites of production and its quantification are of the major challenges. By their nature the inherent reactivity of most free radicals makes their direct in vivo detection impossible. Because of this difficulty various techniques based on an indirect detection of superoxide have been developed with some degree of success.

Thus techniques such as ESR with cyclic nitrone spin traps fluorescence chemiluminescence and cytochrome c reduction have been used to study in vitro and in vivo detection of superoxide radicals in hopes of gaining insight with regard to cellular metabolism and pathogenesis of diverse cytotoxic events but each exhibits potential pitfalls as well as advantages. The Fluoresence based technique using MitoSox red is considered as a simple and accurate method for estimation of biological superoxide and hence it has been widely used for this purpose. However it was found unreliable for intracellular detection because it does not detect superoxide specifically.

In a search for a more reliable selective and convenient method this research developed structurally diverse novel azulenylsilane nitrones. Structurally these novel nitrones are set up in such a way that they are specific for superoxide detection. For example a nitrone moiety and an adjacent silyl group react readily with radicals and oxygen anion respectively. Such nitrones can trap superoxide efficiently because superoxide is both radical and an oxygen anion. Moreover such nitrones allow chromotropic detection of superoxide by the virtue of their azulene core. Synthesis of dinitrone 55 has made it possible to design and synthesize other nitrone congeners with the incorporation of the electron withdrawing cyano group which yields a stable characteristically colored end product from its spin trapping reaction with superoxide. As expected 2 terbutyldimethylsilyl 1 ethyl 3 azulenylnitrone 22 2 tert butyldimethylsilyl 3 azulenecarboxaldehyde 1 1nitrone 23 2 tert butyldimethylsilyl 3 tert butylnitrone 1 2 tert butyl 4 cyano 5 phenyl azulenylisoxazoline 24 and mitochondria targeted 2 tert butyldimethylsilyl 1 5 3 aminoguanidinyl phenylethynyl phenyl 2 tert butyl 4 cyano 5 phenyl isoxazole 3 tert butylazulenylnitrone 25 have been shown to trap superoxide radical anion efficiently yielding UV VIS identifiable and even potentially fluorescence detectable orange products. The in vitro results suggest that the chromotropic detection of superoxide using these nitrones can be a promising method in contrast to other available methods. Further work involves synthesis of mitochondria targeted nitrones 65 and 66. Examination of superoxide reaction with nitrone 25 in biological systems encountered is underway. The in vivo detection of superoxide radical anion may provide additional information. Thus nitrone 25 may be mitochondriotropic and may have significant potential as a diagnostic tool for biological superoxide detection.

An unidentified orange product has been observed by H NMR that contained no tert butyl and methyl groups attached to silyl group. The compound has not been identified yet.

Based on the reported procedure 10 mg of mononitrone 23 0.0271 mmol was treated with 13.3 l dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 0.108 mmol 4 equiv. and dissolved in 0.2 ml of dichloromethane. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 11 hr. Evaporation followed by purification on column chromatography using 7 3 hexane ethylacetate gave 5 mg of purple product. However the purple compound is identified as an intermediate 43 based on H NMR and MS. Therefore the reaction is further stirred for 7 days at 35 C. but only the intermediate compound was recovered.

According to a modified method from Fowler given in the literature treatment of 3.4 mg of p formyl isocyanate 53 0.022 mmol with 12 mg of aminofuran adduct 50 0.022 mmol dissolved either 0.2 ml of benzene or toluene and heated at 90 C. for 7 days failed to show any product by TLC. The solvent was then removed by rotator evaporation. Recrystallized from ether gave 12 mg of wine red solid 89 which is identical to the starting material 50 confirmed by TLC and H NMR.

7.2 mg of carboxynitrile compound 24 0.0127 mmol was treated with 0.04 ml of iodomethane 0.609 mmol and 64 mg of poly 4 vilylpyridine 0.609 mmol and dissolved in 0.5 ml of THF. The reaction was stirred 40 C. for 36 hour. After three product were observed by TLC the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with 15 ml of hexane ethylacetate and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was then chromatographed on silica gel by washing the column with 8 2 hexane ethylacetate to collect the first two purple products 1.5 mg and 3 mg respectively and then polarity was increased to 5 5 ethylacetate hexane to collect 1 gm of green product and 0.8 mg of starting material. However the mixture of products failed to indicate the presence of 57 by H NMR and LRMS. Three products were presumed to be 58 59 and 60 based on their LRMS data.

6 mg of nitrone 22 0.0163 mmol was mixed with 6.9 mg of potassium superoxide 0.097 mmol 6 equiv. and 8.6 mg of crown ether 0.032 mmol 2 equiv. and dissolved the mixture in 1 ml of benzene. The reaction was stirred for 3 hr at room temperature. The product was washed with 10 ml of saturated sodium chloride several times dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The mixture was purified by column chromatography using 5 5 hexane ethylacetate to give 2.2 mg of crude 67 43 . It was not possible to obtain 67 pure enough for definitive NMR characterization. Nevertheless the presence of aldehyde proton and up field shifting of ethyl proton in H NMR data suggested the compound 67. When the same reaction was stirred for three days another orange product was observed. The H NMR was observed with no aldehyde proton signal and LRMS detected MH of 663. Impossible to isolate this product in pure form the structure was not identified.

20 mg of nitrone 24 was treated with 7.5 mg of potassium superoxide and 18.6 mg of crown ether in 1 ml of benzene. The reaction was stirred for 16 hr at room temperature. The mixture was then washed with 10 ml of saturated sodium chloride several times dried and concentrated. Purification of the mixture product by column chromatography using 5 5 ethylacetate hexane afforded 7.2 mg of orange amide 74 in 44 yield.

In addition to compound 74 trace of amide 79 was also recovered which was not enough for NMR characterization. However it was possible to obtain consistent MS data LRMS LC MS ESI MeOH m e 584 MH .

15 mg of nitrone 25 0.021 mmol was treated with 4.4 mg 3 equiv. of potassium superoxide and 11.1 mg 2 equiv. of crown ether in 1 ml of benzene and stirred for 19 hr. Work up was done as aforementioned method. The mixture product was separated by column chromatography beginning with 98 2 dichloromethane methanol and increasing the polarity to 94 6 dichloromethane methanol to provide crude brownish orange product. LRMS analysis indicated the compound 80 with 654 MH as a major product and the compound 81 with 768 MH as a minor product along with some starting material. It was not possible to separate the mixture pure enough for NMR characterization.

UV vis and Fluorescence experiments were performed with assistance of Dr. Moon s students. The orange product 74 from the reaction of 2 tert butyldimethylsilyl 3 tert butylnitrone 1 2 tert butyl 4 cyano 5 phenyl azulenylisoxazoline 24 with superoxide was tested. Compound 74 was dissolved in ethanol for UV vis absorbance measurement in scan range of 200 400 nm with scan rate of 600 nm min at average time 0.1 s and data interval of 1.00 nm. Fluorescence signal was obtained in scan range of 400 700 nm using 0.1 s integration time with an increment of 0.1 nm. Both the excitation slit wide and the emission slit wide were selected 1.5 nm with the excitation wavelength fixed at 390 nm.
