This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 474 096 filed Apr. 11 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support from the Air Force Research Laboratory through grant award no. FA8650 05 D 55807 subcontract 06 5568 BH C1 . The government has certain rights in the invention.

The disclosure relates to curable polyureasil compounds methods related to curing of such compounds via hydrolysis and or condensation to form coatings on a substrate and coated articles formed from the curable polyureasil compounds.

Aluminum and aluminum alloys AA are important materials mainly for aerospace applications among many others. Protection of aluminum based materials from atmospheric corrosion is important for long term durability and costs associated with their maintenance. Aircraft coatings are designed to provide long lasting corrosion and abrasion protection in addition to decorative functions. The coating system is typically comprised of a conversion coating layer a primer layer and a topcoat layer.

A conversion coating is a type of coating deposited at the metal surface such that it is strongly adherent and covalently bonded to the surface thus providing excellent adhesion and a barrier for corrosive elements. Additionally it provides for good adhesion of the primer layer to its surface. Thus conversion coatings surface pretreatments have an important role in the success of a composite coating system such as used for aircraft.

Among available technologies for surface pretreatments chromate conversion coatings are by far the most efficient for aluminum and alloys. These coatings are typically applied from acidic mixtures of soluble hexavalent chromium salts by oxidation reduction reactions with the metal surface. A continuous layer of insoluble trivalent chromium and soluble hexavalent chromium compounds are formed. The use of chromates in the coating has generated serious environmental and health issues for the coating industry because hexavalent chromates are carcinogenic and highly toxic 1 . The costs associated with worker safety and the containment treatment and disposal of hazardous materials related to the coating process is one of the highest costs for maintenance activities in the Air Force 2 . Recent legislation however substantially limits the use of chromate based coatings.

Chromium alternatives have been explored with the goal of developing environmentally benign conversion coatings with comparable performance of chromate based ones 3 such as organic inorganic hybrid thin films formed through sol gel processing 4 16 . Organic inorganic hybrid materials also referred to as ormosils or ceramers or ormocers are formed by hydrolysis and condensation of organically modified silanes or other metals with traditional alkoxide precursors such as tetraethoxysilane TEOS or tetramethoxysilane TMOS or metal alkoxides of Zr Ti Al etc. by a sol gel method 17 18 . Sol gel chemistry is useful in a wide range of thin film applications and has the potential to incorporate chemically tailored features aimed at the development of corrosion resistance through the use of structurally modified reactants 19 29 . For example forming functionalized silica nanoparticles in situ in an aqueous sol gel process and then cross linking the nanoparticles to form a thin film has been successful 22 27 .

Deposition of organic inorganic hybrid coating films involves complex hydrolysis and condensation reactions 28 . In most cases the sol gel precursors the metal silicon alkoxides and organoalkoxysilanes are simultaneously hydrolyzed in a dilute aqueous solution under controlled pH conditions. Typical metal silicon alkoxides used are tetraethoxyorthosilicate TEOS tetramethoxyorthosilicate TMOS zirconium tetra isopropoxide and titanium tetraisopropoxide. During this process metal silicon alkoxides and organoalkoxysilanes hydrolyze at significantly different rates to generate silanol SiOH groups and silanol functional silica networks nanoparticles . This solution is then applied onto a metal substrate and cured under varying conditions. Sufficient numbers of silanol groups should be present before application of the sols on to the substrate in order to form a dense cross linked network with sufficient covalent bonding with substrate.

The disclosure generally relates to organic inorganic hybrid coatings with excellent resistance properties. In various aspects corrosion resistant coatings can be derived by one or more of a selecting the chemical structure and degree of functionality of curable coating precursors b selecting hydrolysis condensation reaction conditions and reactant mixture components for the sol gel precursors to control the structure of the resulting cured coating c selecting suitable corrosion inhibitors for inclusion in the coating d controlling the relative ratio of organic and inorganic components in the cured coatings e controlling the relative proportion of water and organic solvent e.g. alcohols for the precursor mixture and f selecting suitable cure conditions for an applied coating. The resulting coatings are dense adherent coatings with excellent corrosion resistance as characterized by several standard metrics e.g. salt spray fog test boiling water test potentiodynamic scanning .

Additional features of the disclosure may become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings examples and appended claims.

While the disclosed processes compositions and methods are susceptible of embodiments in various forms specific embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated in the drawings and will hereafter be described with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

The disclosure generally relates to curable polyureasil compounds methods related to curing of such compounds via hydrolysis and or condensation to form coatings on a substrate and coated articles formed from the curable polyureasil compounds.

The polyureasil compounds are generally hydrocarbon based including multiple urea groups and multiple hydrolysable silyl groups. As described below the urea groups i.e. a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues provide both a convenient means for chemical synthesis of the polyureasil compounds as well as structure for internal hydrogen bonding in the resulting applied coating film e.g. between a nitrogen atom in one urea group and a carbonyl oxygen in a neighboring urea group . The hydrolysable silyl groups can be hydrolyzed and subsequently condensed to provide a networked polymeric structure with siloxane urea linkages between polyureasil compound precursors. The combination of hydrogen bonding interactions and siloxane linkages provides a dense strong resilient adherent coating with favorable barrier and corrosion resistance properties.

A curable polyureasil compound according to the disclosure includes a hydrocarbon moiety with at least 2 urea groups e.g. 2 3 or 4 urea groups and at least 6 hydrolysable silyl groups e.g. 6 9 12 18 or 24 hydrolysable silyl groups linked to the hydrocarbon moiety via the various urea groups.

A general urea group can be represented by the structure RRN C O NRR such as where Ris a linker to the hydrolysable silyl groups e.g. a hydrocarbon moiety with at least 1 2 or 3 and or up to 4 6 8 or 10 carbon atoms Rand Rindependently can be a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon moiety e.g. alkyl group such as with at least 1 2 or 3 and or up to 4 6 8 or 10 carbon atoms and or Ris a linking moiety between other urea groups in the polyureasil compound e.g. a hydrocarbon moiety or a heteroatom substituted hydrocarbon moiety with at least 2 4 8 or 12 and or up to 20 30 40 or 50 carbon atoms . The urea groups can be the same or different in a given polyureasil compound e.g. any or all of the substituents R R Rand Rcan be the same or different among the various urea groups . In different embodiments the curable polyureasil compound can include at least 2 3 or 4 and or up to 4 6 or 8 urea groups.

The hydrolysable silyl groups include functional groups attached to a silicon atom e.g. 1 2 or 3 functional hydrolysable silyl groups per silicon atom that can be hydrolyzed under suitable conditions e.g. when in contact with water such as under acidic conditions to form corresponding silanol Si OH functional groups which in turn can be condensed to form siloxane Si O Si functional groups linkages in a cured polyureasil compound coating. The hydrolysable silyl group can include a hydrocarbon group linked via an oxygen atom to a silicon atom e.g. Si OR such as alkoxy groups having 1 2 3 or 4 carbon atoms and or a halogen atom linked to a silicon atom e.g. Si X such as for F Cl Br or I . Examples of specific hydrolysable silyl groups include silicon bound methoxy groups and or ethoxy groups. The hydrolysable silyl groups are generally all the same to promote a uniform rate of hydrolysis condensation but the specific groups can be different in an embodiment if desired to have a distribution of different hydrolysis condensation e.g. a curable polyureasil compound including some methoxy groups and some ethoxy groups . In different embodiments the curable polyureasil compound can include at least 6 7 8 9 12 and or up to 12 18 or 24 hydrolysable silyl groups depending on the number of silicon atoms included and the degree of functionality of each silicon atom.

In an embodiment the curable polyureasil compound can be represented by the following Structure I R NR C O NAA I In Structure I a R can be a hydrocarbon moiety or a heteroatom substituted hydrocarbon moiety e.g. N O S substituted containing from 1 to 50 carbon atoms e.g. at least 2 4 8 or 12 and or up to 20 30 40 or 50 carbon atoms b Acontains hydrolysable silyl groups and can be represented by R Si R X c Acan contain hydrolysable silyl groups and can be represented by R Si R X i.e. with silyl groups or H or R i.e. without silyl groups d X can be a hydrolysable group such as an alkoxy group an aryloxy group a carboxyloxy group or a halogen e.g. having at least having 1 2 3 or 4 and or up to 4 6 8 10 or 12 carbon atoms for non halogens where X can be the same or different on any particular silicon atom e Rand Rcan be a hydrocarbon moiety or a heteroatom substituted hydrocarbon moiety e.g. N O S substituted containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms e.g. at least 2 4 8 or 12 and or up to 4 8 12 16 or 20 carbon atoms where Rand Rcan be the same or different and f Rcan be hydrogen or a hydrocarbon moiety or a heteroatom substituted hydrocarbon moiety e.g. N O S substituted containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms e.g. at least 2 4 8 or 12 and or up to 4 8 12 16 or 20 carbon atoms . Rcan be selected in its various instances e.g. explicitly illustrated in Structure I or as a component of Aor A to be the same or different. The value x corresponds to the number of urea groups in the curable polyureasil compound and can be at least 2 3 4 and or up to 3 4 6 8 or 10. The specific selections for R R A A and X can be the same or different in each of the x instances of the urea containing group of Structure I e.g. for x 2 or higher the substituents in the repeated unit NR C O NAA can be the same or different . The values y and z correspond to the number of hydrolysable silyl groups in Aor A i.e. when Ais not H or R respectively and they independently can be 1 2 or 3. The product x y or x y z can reflect the total number of hydrolysable silyl groups in the curable polyureasil compound and suitably can be at least 6 or more than 6.

The hydrocarbon groups moieties in the various components of the curable polyureasil compound an of Structure I generally can include saturated or unsaturated linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon groups alicyclic hydrocarbon groups aryl hydrocarbon groups and heteroatom including analogs derivates of the same e.g. including N O S heteroatoms . The hydrocarbon groups R R R or R additionally can include hydrolysable silyl groups i.e. in addition to those explicitly illustrated in Aand A . As noted above the hydrolyzable X groups can be the same in all instances in the curable polyureasil compound to promote uniform hydrolysis and condensation rates but they can be different in alternate embodiments. In another embodiment one or both of Ras bound to the urea nitrogen in Structure I and Acan be hydrogen atoms to promote film cohesion via interchain hydrogen bonding with neighboring carbonyl oxygens.

The disclosed curable polyureasil compound has a high reactivity e.g. promoting rapid and extensive curing a robust chemical structure e.g. providing resistance to degradation and excellent mechanical properties once cured e.g. in the form of a film on a substrate . The specific chemical structure and functional groups of the curable polyureasil compound can be selected and synthesized by reaction between one or more aminosilanes e.g. aminoalkyl mono di or tri alkoxysilanes with one or more polyisocyanates e.g. di or tri isocyanates for example in equivalent molar proportions based on the amino and isocyanate functional groups to yield polyureasil compounds. Thus the hydrocarbon moiety of the polyureasil compound has a structure corresponding to a reaction product resulting from an amination reaction of the polyisocyanate with the aminosilane. The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between organic components within the cross linked hybrid network e.g. through urea linkages provides improved coating performance.

Suitable polyisocyanates useable as a precursor to the hydrocarbon moiety of the curable polyureasil compound include any organic compound having at least two free isocyanate N C O groups per molecule e.g. 2 3 or 4 isocyanate groups for example having about 4 to 20 carbon atoms in addition to nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen and including aliphatic cycloaliphatic aryl aliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates as well as products of their oligomerization used alone or in mixtures of two or more. Suitable polyisocyanates are diisocyanate compounds for example having the general form Y NCO with Y representing a bivalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms a bivalent cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms a bivalent aromatic hydrocarbon group having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms or a bivalent aryl aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 7 to 15 carbon atoms. Higher polyisocyanates can provide a higher degree of networking in the cured polymer e.g. represented by Y NCO or Y NCO for 3 or 4 isocyanate groups respectively where Y is a trivalent or tetravalent group analogous to that above .

Specific examples of suitable aliphatic polyisocyanates include alpha omega alkylene diisocyanates having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms such as hexamethylene 1 6 diisocyanate HDI 1 12 dodecane diisocyanate 2 2 4 trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate 2 4 4 trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate 2 methyl 1 5 pentamethylene diisocyanate and the like. Specific examples of suitable cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates include dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate isophorone diisocyanate IPDI 1 4 cyclohexane diisocyanate 1 3 bis isocyanatomethyl cyclohexane and the like. Specific examples of suitable araliphatic polyisocyanates include m tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate p tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate 1 4 xylylene diisocyanate 1 3 xylylene diisocyanate and the like. Examples of suitable aromatic polyisocyanates include 4 4 diphenylmethylene diisocyanate MDI and its isomers toluene diisocyanate TDI and its isomers naphthalene diisocyanate their oligomeric forms and the like. An example of a suitable triisocyanate includes a trimer of isophorone diisocyanate IPDI trimer .

Suitable animosilanes useable as a precursor to the hydrolysable silyl groups of the curable polyureasil compound include any organic compound having one or more amine groups e.g. free primary or secondary amino group and one or more hydrolysable silyl groups per molecule e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 hydrolysable silyl groups with 1 or 2 corresponding silicon atoms . The animosilanes are suitably monoamines. The animosilanes can have a hydrocarbon group having at least 1 or 2 and or up to 6 or 10 carbon atoms that links the amino group with the hydrolysable silyl groups e.g. with the amino group and the corresponding silicon atom at opposing terminal ends of the linking group . Suitable aminosilanes can be represented by the form NHAA where A A X and R Rare as described above for the curable polyureasil compound. Specific examples of suitable aminosilanes include 3 aminopropyl trialkoxysilane e.g. including trimethoxy APTMS and triethoxy APTES species and bis 3 trialkoxysilylpropyl amine e.g. including trimethoxy BTMSPA and triethoxy BTESPA species .

The curable polyureasil compound in any of the various embodiments to the disclosure can be cured with water to form a cured polyureasil compound having covalent intermolecular siloxane urea crosslinks in the networked polymer product. The intermolecular crosslinks relate to the formation of covalent bonds between originally separate curable polyureasil molecules. In some instances intramolecular crosslinking is possible in the networked polymer product as well. The curing process generally involves a serial two step mechanism in which at least some of the hydrolysable silyl groups in the curable polyureasil compound are first hydrolyzed to silanol groups e.g. generally an acid catalyzed aqueous reaction and the silanol groups are then condensed to form intermolecular siloxane crosslinks. Condensation crosslinking to form a siloxane link can occur between two silanol groups e.g. to yield water as a byproduct or between a silanol group and an unhydrolyzed silyl group from the curable polyureasil compound e.g. to yield a corresponding alcohol from an alkoxy hydrolysable group or a corresponding acid form a halogen hydrolysable group . The resulting networked polymer includes a silica network sol with individual units linked via the urea containing hydrocarbon moiety of the curable polyureasil compound e.g. including siloxane cage like structures linked via urea containing hydrocarbon moiety at cage vertices .

In an extension of the curing process that further involves the coating of the polyureasil compound onto a substrate the curable polyureasil compound is first partially cured e.g. partially substantially or completely hydrolyzed but without partial substantial or complete condensation in the absence of the substrate. The partially cured polyureasil compound is then applied to the substrate by any convenient means e.g. dipping immersing spraying coating etc. the substrate with a solution mixture including the partially cured polyureasil compound . Once applied the partially cured polyureasil compound on the substrate continues to cure e.g. including further hydrolysis where appropriate as well as condensation for network polymer formation thereby forming the cured polyureasil compound as a coating on the substrate. Once applied to the substrate and after substantial evaporation of water and any organic solvent a rapid and high degree of condensation is desirable to obtain films with good barrier properties. The rates of such gel formation reactions are a function of temperature among other factors. Suitably the post application cure can be performed at ambient temperature e.g. 20 C. to 30 C. or at higher temperatures e.g. ambient temperature up to 50 C. 75 C. 100 C. 150 C. or 200 C. .

It is desirable increase the relative silanol content of a coating solution sol including the polyureasil compound before application onto the substrate in order to achieve a resulting coating with good barrier properties. The rate of hydrolysis for different sol gel precursors i.e. curable polyureasil compounds can significantly vary under given reaction conditions so systems containing two or more precursors of different reactivity e.g. whether different compounds altogether or analogous precursors with different hydrolysable groups can result in a broad distribution of species at various points in the curing reaction path. For example excessive hydrolysis and condensation can be observed in the more reactive precursor species while little to no hydrolysis and or condensation may be observed in the less reactive precursor species. A relatively low silanol content can result in lower a number of covalent bonds with a metal substrate thus forming a coating with reduced corrosion resistance and substrate adhesion. The curable polyureasil compound suitably has 6 or more e.g. 6 9 12 18 or 24 hydrolysable silyl groups of the same type e.g. methoxy or ethoxy . The polyureasil compound when hydrolyzed in aqueous acidic solution exhibits a fairly uniform rapid rate of hydrolysis e.g. compared to a metal alkoxide or silicon tetraalkoxide such as TEOS . The high functionality of the polyureasil compound helps produce a denser film and the absence of metal or silicon alkoxide in some embodiments makes possible a single step and faster process. The curable polyureasil compound and related induction coating curing process provides improved control over the composition of the coating bath solution e.g. in terms of relative silanol content and hence the performance properties of the corresponding pretreatments and coatings. For example the curable polyureasil compound in the initial reaction mixture is suitably pre hydrolyzed for a sufficient time during an induction period such that least 50 60 70 or 80 and or up to 80 90 95 or 100 of the original hydrolysable silyl groups number or molar basis have been hydrolyzed to silanol groups. Alternatively or additionally the induction time can be selected to avoid excessive condensation such that not more than 5 10 20 or 30 of the original hydrolysable silyl groups number or molar basis have been condensed to siloxane linking groups.

The curable polyureasil compound is suitably provided in the form of an aqueous mixture that serves as an initial pre hydrolysis induction medium as well as a coating dipping solution for subsequent substrate application. In addition to water and the curable polyureasil compound the aqueous mixture can further include an organic solvent for the curable polyureasil compound a hydrolysis catalyst a corrosion inhibitor and a silane crosslinker. Suitable amounts for the various mixture components relative to the mixture as a whole can include at least 5 wt. or 10 wt. and or up to 30 wt. or 40 wt. for the curable polyureasil compound at least 2 wt. or 10 wt. and or up to 50 wt. or 70 wt. for water at least 10 wt. or 20 wt. and or up to 50 wt. or 50 wt. for the organic solvent at least 0.5 wt. or 1 wt. and or up to 3 wt. or 5 wt. for the catalyst and at least 0.1 wt. or 1 wt. and or up to 3 wt. or 5 wt. for the corrosion inhibitor when present . Alternatively or additionally the corrosion inhibitor can be present in an amount such that its concentration in the final cured film is at least 0.1 wt. 0.5 wt. or 1 wt. and or up to 3 wt. 5 wt. or 10 wt. .

The addition of a water miscible organic solvent that is compatible e.g. capable of solvating the curable polyureasil compound can provide sufficient phase stability to the mixture and can control the equilibrium reaction rates in the curing system. The water solvent ratio in the mixture can be selected to control the properties of the resulting coating. The solvent is suitably an alcohol such as methanol ethanol iso propanol and mixtures thereof. The particular alcohol solvent can be selected to correspond to the alcohol that is liberated from the curable polyureasil compound upon hydrolysis e.g. an alcohol corresponding to the alkoxy group on the silicon atom . Other non alcohol solvents that are water miscible and compatible with polyureasil precursor also can be used for example including acetone and or tetrahydrofuran THF .

The catalyst added to the mixture is suitably a Br nsted acid for example a carboxylic acid such as formic acid acetic acid and or lactic acid. Alternatively or additionally stronger mineral acids such as phosphoric acid nitric acid and or hydrochloric acid can be used. The catalyst suitably is added to the mixture in an amount to achieve an acidic pH value to be maintained during induction coating for example of at least 2 or 3 and or up to about 4 5 or 6.

The corrosion inhibitor added to the mixture can be any suitable compound known for its corrosion resistance and or antioxidant properties. The presence of the corrosion inhibitor in the curing mixture allows the inhibitor to be homogeneously dispersed in the eventual cured polyureasil coating. In some embodiments organic inhibitors are preferred over inorganic ones as they generally have little or effect on the pH of the curing mixture and it is desirable to carefully control the pH value in order to control the kinetics of the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the mixture. Suitable organic inhibitors include heterocyclic organic compounds having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms e.g. N O S along with anti corrosion properties. Specific examples of suitable organic inhibitors include 8 hydroxyquinoline benzimidazole mercaptobenzothiazole mercaptobenzimidazole benzotriazole and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments the curable polyureasil compound is the only source of intermolecular siloxane crosslinks in the reaction mixture and in the resulting cured polyureasil compound e.g. the reaction mixture is free or substantially free from other added species having hydrolysable silyl groups . As described above it can be desirable to have only a single chemical species in the mixture that contains hydrolysable silyl groups to promote uniformity of the curing reactions in the system. Alternatively or additionally the mixture can be free from other added sources of silicon whether in the form of hydrolysable silyl groups cured siloxane crosslinks or otherwise. In other embodiments however the reaction mixture can include a silane crosslinker to increase the crosslink density and barrier properties in the resulting cured polymer coating. Suitable silane crosslinkers can be represented by the form Si R X where X and Rare as described above for the curable polyureasil compound except that y is selected to be 2 3 or 4. Examples of suitable silane crosslinkers include tetraethoxyorthosilicate TEOS and tetramethoxyorthosilicate TMOS . Because of the generally differing rates of hydrolysis between the silane crosslinker and the curable polyureasil compound the silane crosslinker is suitably pre hydrolyzed to a desired degree in a separate aqueous reaction mixture i.e. which does not contain the curable polyureasil compound and then the partially hydrolyzed silane crosslinker is added to the reaction mixture containing the curable polyureasil compound for its pre hydrolysis induction period. While the inclusion of the silane crosslinker generally involves an initial reaction process step it can provide a resulting cured polyureasil compound with improved structural properties.

The substrate is not particularly limited but it is suitably a metallic substrate . In this case the cured polyureasil compound coating serves to reduce or prevent corrosion of the underlying metallic substrate from ambient environmental conditions. In various embodiments the substrate can be a metal e.g. aluminum a metal alloy e.g. an aluminum containing alloy or a non metal. In some embodiments the polyureasil coating is adhered to the substrate via covalent linkages. Many metal substrates M including aluminum Al contain surface bound hydroxyl groups e.g. M OH or Al OH either present natively or after surface preparation by conventional techniques that themselves can condense during cure with silanol groups in the hydrolyzed polyureasil compound to release water and form an adherent covalent linking functional group between the metal substrate and the cured polyureasil compound e.g. polymer coating SiOM metal substrate or polymer coating SiOAl aluminum substrate .

In an extension the coated article optionally can include a polymeric primer layer and or a polymeric topcoat layer as additional layers providing barrier sealant anti corrosion properties. As illustrated in the primer layer is coated on an outer surface of the polyureasil coating e.g. the surface opposing that to which the substrate is adhered . Similarly the topcoat layer is coated on an outer surface of the primer layer e.g. the surface opposing that to which the polyureasil coating is adhered . When the primer layer is not present the topcoat layer can be coated on the outer surface of the polyureasil coating . In addition to providing anti corrosion properties the polymeric primer layer additionally promotes adhesion between the polyureasil coating and the topcoat layer . Such polymeric coatings are suitably chromium free e.g. free from hexavalent chromium trivalent chromium and or chromium in any other form . Suitable polymeric materials for the primer and topcoat are generally known and are not particularly limited with specific examples including epoxy polyester polyurethane polyurea and acrylic based coatings e.g. where the primer and topcoat suitably have the same or similar base polymeric character such as polyurethane or polyurea based primers topcoats having hydrogen bonding donor acceptor groups for improved wetting and adhesion properties relative to the urea groups of the cured polyureasil coating .

Aerospace aluminum alloy 2024 T3 with copper as the primary alloying element in the form of 2 3 panels was used as a test substrate for coating application and corrosion resistance testing. Prior to coating panels were hand scrubbed using a maroon SCOTCH BRITE with 10 solution of BRULIN 815 GD detergent in DI water and then rinsed with DI water. They were then immersed in 10 solution of BRULIN 815 GD detergent in DI water at minimum 142 F. followed by washing with DI water. Then the panels were deoxidized for 2 min in phosphoric acid based deoxidizing solution followed by DI water rinse and drying and were then stacked for 24 h before being used for application. Before coating application all the panels were washed with DI water for removal of any loose dirt on the surface. Once prepared coatings were applied at room temperature 25 30 C. by dip coating method at standard withdrawal speed of 15 17 cm min with residence time being 15 20 seconds. After application panels were placed vertically in a panel stacker for air drying. The typical dry film thickness of coating was about 2 5 microns.

Substrates coated with a cured polyureasil compound were characterized for accelerated corrosion performance by neutral salt fog test ASTM B117 salt spray test and were monitored for varying lengths of time. The performance rating of samples was done as per ASTM D 610 PRA IT 004 SSPC VIS2 Publication no. 00 08 ISBN 1 889060 48 8 . Salt spray results were expressed on a scale from 0 to 10 relative to a hexavalent chromium coated control substrate which was assigned a reference value of 10. As illustrated in the following examples coated metallic substrates according to the disclosure suitably exhibit a neutral salt fog corrosion resistance rating of at least 6 e.g. at least 6 7 8 or 9 up to a maximum of 10 for ASTM B117 salt spray test relative to the hexavalent chromium reference when measured at 500 hours or 1000 hours. The corrosion resistance ratings reflect the cured polyureasil coated substrate alone e.g. without additional polymeric layers topcoats but including anti corrosion inhibitors that may be incorporated into the cured polyureasil layer itself . Samples also were tested for hydrolytic stability using 4 h boiling water immersion test. The relevant analytical methodologies are incorporated herein by reference.

Comparative Example 1 reflects comparative data using a two step coating process with various bis ureasils and TEOS as two different species containing hydrolysable silyl groups. The data were originally presented in Kakde and Mannari Advanced chrome free organic inorganic hybrid pretreatments for aerospace aluminum alloy 2024 T3 application of novel bis ureasil sol gel precursors . Volume 6 Number 2 201 211 2009 presented Oct. 14 16 2008 Kakde which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Four bis ureasil compounds differing in chemical structures were synthesized by reaction of an amine functional silane APTMS or APTES with different diisocyanate compounds namely IPDI HDI and TDI using a 2 1 molar ratio. The following general procedure was used for synthesis of bis ureasils. Into a three necked reaction flask provided with a mechanical stirrer thermometer and an inlet for nitrogen gas calculated amounts of dry THF and APTMS were charged and the mixture was stirred for 10 min until clear solution was obtained. Diisocyanate was then slowly added from an addition funnel under stirring at room temperature. After complete addition of diisocyanate the mixture was stirred for 2.0 h. Completion of reaction was followed by FTIR spectroscopy for disappearance of NCO absorption band at 2 270 cm. THF was then removed under rotary vacuum evaporator at 50 C. The product bis ureasil was then dissolved in dry ethanol 30 70 solids and stored in plastic bottles under desiccator. In synthesis of TDI based bis ureasil IPA was used as solvent in place of THF for the reasons of solubility and stability of the product. Based on the type of diisocyanate used the bis ureasils were designated by letters C IPDI I HDI L TDI . A bis ureasil was also synthesized from APTES and IPDI following the stated general procedure and was designated as T.

The preparation of sols and their substrate application were carried out in the following stepwise manner 

Step 1 Pre hydrolysis of TEOS TEOS was added to the mixture of ethanol and double distilled water and GAA acid catalyst . The pH of the solution was varied in the range of 2.6 2.9. The mixture was stirred under magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 24 72 h.

Step 2 Post addition of bis ureasil Appropriate quantity of bis ureasil compound was then added into pre hydrolyzed TEOS solution step 1 and solid contents were adjusted 25 by wt. using deionized water and ethanol. The pH of the solution was varied between 3.25 and 5. Bis ureasil TEOS ratio was varied from 0.5 to 2.0. For all the samples studied the ratio of water ethanol and solid contents was maintained constant.

Example 2 illustrates a single step coating process with various bis and tris ureasils as the sole coating species containing hydrolysable silyl groups i.e. without TEOS or other silane crosslinker .

Bis and tris ureasils with hydrolysable silyl group functionalities of 6 9 and 18 were formed as generally described in Comparative Example 1 using a di functional isocyanate IPDI or a tri functional isocyanate IPDI trimer in combination with a tri functional aminosilane APTES or a hexa functional aminosilane BTESPA . The curable polyureasils formed are summarized in Table 2 below.

A coating solution bath was formed by adding the bis or tris ureasil compound solution in dry ethanol to a calculated quantity of ethanol and water mixture containing glacial acetic acid as catalyst. The bis or tris ureasil compound was selected to have a weight concentration in the bath between 5 wt. and 40 wt. and the ethanol water weight ratio of the liquid solution medium was selected to be between 1 0.25 and 1 2.5. The solution was adjusted to pH ranging from 3.0 4.5. The coating solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at temperature of 25 35 C. to provide an induction step for hydrolysis of the ureasil precursor. The coating solution was ready for substrate application dipping after an induction time of about 20 30 minutes.

Sample substrate panels of the aluminum alloy 2024 T3 3 5 were pre cleaned as described above. The panels were coated with the aqueous bath solution at room temperature using a dip coating instrument at the controlled rate of about 10 20 cm min. The dip coated panels were allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes followed by further curing drying in oven at varying temperature time conditions e.g. under ambient room temperature conditions for 48 hr and ranging up to 200 C. for 30 min . The sample panels were evaluated for various anti corrosion properties as described above. The data in Table 3 below were obtained by ambient condition drying for 30 min followed by heating at 120 C. for 30 min in an oven.

Pretreatment films were characterized for DC polarization resistance electrochemical test and neutral salt for test as per ASTM B 117 accelerated corrosion test . For the DC polarization study a 5 NaCl solution was used as the electrolyte. The results showed that a dense and adherent hybrid nanocomposite coating was formed on the surface that showed good corrosion resistance when tested by the salt fog test ASTM B 117 and by DC polarization resistance.

As shown in Table 3 below the coatings resulting from the higher functionality polyureasil precursors e.g. more than 6 hydrolysable silyl groups per precursor molecule showed excellent performance. Specifically with an increase in silyl group functionality from 6 to 9 and higher the corrosion resistance performance substantially improves. Similarly for samples B and C of Example 2 the corrosion resistance is comparable to the best sample C of Comparative Example 1 yet the single component higher functionality coating i is formed in a simpler 1 step process as compared to a 2 step process and ii requires about 50 150 times less initialization time before substrate coating can begin c.f. about 0.5 hr used for a single induction step in Example 2 relative to a minimum 24 72 hr process for Example 1 to complete TEOS pre hydrolysis prior to bis ureasil induction . The single component higher functionality coating can be obtained with a high degree of crosslinking thus eliminating the need for an additional crosslinking component and additional time in a TEOS based system. These results also show that some of the coating systems can perform very close to that of a hexavalent chromium based system.

Comparative Example 1 was repeated except that an organic corrosion inhibitor was also added under stirring to the coating solution so that the corrosion inhibitor would be incorporated into the applied cured coating at a desired concentration. Specifically sample C i.e. IPDI APTMS bis ureasil with TEOS crosslinker was reproduced with the addition of mercaptobenzthiazole MBT at levels of 0 1 2 and 3 w w in the final film. As shown in Table 4 below the addition of the organic corrosion inhibitor substantially improved the anticorrosion properties of the coating. In Table 4 a hexavalent chromium panel was used as a reference with a relative rating of 10 for the salt spray test the boiling water test and the DC polarization test.
