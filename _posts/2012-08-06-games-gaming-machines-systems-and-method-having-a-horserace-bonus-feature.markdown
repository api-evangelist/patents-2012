The present embodiments are directed to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods in particular to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods having bonus feature games.

Various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards such as cash or prizes. For example in some slot machines the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel thereby allowing for multiple line betting.

Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations the progressive prize may have a small probability of a player winning it thus making it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations the progressive prize may be a small amount thus allowing the player to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.

Feature games of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. Generally such feature games are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In order to stimulate interest feature games are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays.

While gaming machines including feature games have been successful there remains a need for feature games that provide players with enhanced excitement and an increased opportunity of winning.

Briefly and in general terms there is disclosed a method for playing a secondary game in association with a primary wagering game on a gaming machine. The method includes activating the secondary game upon the occurrence of a predefined triggering event in the primary wagering game. The secondary game includes a first and second marker disposed in relation to a finish line on a screen of the gaming machine. Play of the secondary game begins by randomly generating various icons including a first bonus icon and a second bonus icon wherein the first bonus icon is associated with the first marker and the second bonus icon is associated with the second marker. In one embodiment the markers or symbols are icons of horses and the screen resembles a carnival style horse racing game. The image appears to be of horses racing toward a finish line.

The method also includes advancing the first marker one space closer to a finish line displayed on the screen each instance the first bonus icon is generated during play of the secondary game and advancing the second marker one space closer to the finish line displayed on the screen each instance the second bonus icon is generated during play of the secondary game. In one embodiment play of the secondary game includes free plays until the first or second marker reaches the finish line.

During play of the secondary game a first prize or progressive award is associated with the first marker and a second prize or progressive award is associated with the second marker. The method also includes awarding the first progressive award if the first marker reaches the finish line first and awarding the second progressive award if the second marker reaches the finish line first. If the first and second markers reach the finish line at the same time the first and second progressive awards are both awarded. Once the first or second prize is awarded play of the secondary game is deactivated and play of the primary wagering game is reengaged. In yet another embodiment of a method for playing a bonus game in association with a primary game the method includes engaging in the play of the primary game on a slot machine having a plurality of reels. The slot machine may be a video slot machine and the primary game may be a slot game. Bonus game is activated upon the occurrence of a predefined triggering event in the primary game. The reels of the slot machine include a first bonus icon and a second bonus icon wherein the first bonus icon is associated with a first marker and the second bonus icon is associated with a second marker. First and second markers are disposed in relation to a finish line displayed on a screen of the slot machine. In one embodiment the markers or symbols are icons of horses and the screen resembles a carnival style horse racing game. The image appears to be of horses racing toward a finish line.

This method also includes awarding free spins of the reels during play of the bonus game and awarding a payout according to a pay table for the primary game during play of the bonus game. During the free spins the first marker is advanced one space closer to a finish line displayed on the screen each instance the first bonus icon appears on the reels of the slot machine and the second marker is advanced one space closer to the finish line displayed on the screen each instance the second bonus icon appears on the reels.

Also a first prize associated with the first marker and a second prize associated with the second marker is displayed on the slot machine. The method includes awarding the first prize if the first marker reaches the finish line first and awarding the second prize if the second marker reaches the finish line first. It is possible to award both the first and second prizes if the first and second markers reach the finish line at the same time. In one embodiment the first and second prizes are progressive prizes. However the first and second prizes may also be set amounts. After the first or second prize has been awarded the method includes deactivating the bonus game and re engaging the play of the primary game.

In a further embodiment a system for providing a bonus game to be played in conjunction with a main game is disclosed. The system includes a gaming device configured to enable play of the main game and the bonus game wherein the bonus game is initiated upon the occurrence of a predefined triggering event in the primary game. In one embodiment the gaming device is a video slot machine. Also the gaming device is capable of randomly generating icons including a first bonus icon and a second bonus icon wherein the first bonus icon is associated with a first symbol and the second bonus icon is associated with a second symbol and the first and second symbols are displayed on a screen of the gaming device having a position relative to a finish line displayed on the screen. In one embodiment the symbols are icons of horses and the screen resembles a carnival style horse racing game. The image appears to be of horses racing toward a finish line.

The system also includes a progressive controller in communication with the gaming device that calculates a value for multiple progressive prizes available during play of the bonus game. Furthermore the gaming device awards free spins during play of the bonus game and awards a payout according to the main game during play of the bonus game. During play of the bonus game the gaming device advances the first symbol one space closer to the finish line displayed on the screen each time the first bonus icon is generated during play of the bonus game and advances the second symbol one space closer to the finish line displayed on the screen each time the second bonus icon is generated. The gaming device awards a first progressive prize associated with the first symbol if the first symbol reaches the finish line first and the gaming device awards a second progressive prize associated with the second symbol if the second symbol reaches the finish line first.

Features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming networks and method for playing a game wherein the game includes a horserace bonus feature game. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming networks and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the invention.

An example game is shown in . Referring to game is implemented using five spinning reels . Each of 40 pay line patterns passes through one indicium on each of the five reels. The number of pay lines and their patterns are by way of example only and may vary. The player selects the number of played pay lines and the number of credits or coins wagered on each line using touch screen controls or gaming device control buttons. A credit meter provides the player with information about the amount paid by the last game played and the total number of credits available for play. A bet meter displays the size of the currently selected wager. The player may collect the balance of his credits by pressing a collect button not shown .

The player initiates game play by pressing a spin button not shown . In some embodiments the player may simultaneously select all pay lines at the maximum number of coins or credits allowed per line by pressing a max bet button not shown . Various controls buttons see on gaming machine or touch screen buttons may be used to perform the actions described here without deviating from the scope of the invention. Reels are made to spin and stop in predetermined stop positions. A determination is made whether the stop positions of the reels represents a winning game outcome.

Referring to in accordance with one or more embodiments the player may view various pay table displays on the primary game display by way of a GAME INFO or similar button. These displays describe the rules and play of the primary and feature games. In alternate embodiments the pay table displays may be presented on a second video or printed display attached to the gaming device i.e. display or pay glass . A winning combination for example could be three or more symbols scattered one per reel from left to right. For each winning combination the game device awards the player the award in the pay table adjusted as necessary based on the number of credits wagered on the pay line on which the win occurred.

In some embodiments various primary game outcomes may be utilized to trigger the play of a feature game including but not limited to awarding feature play when certain symbols appear on a pay line when certain symbols are scattered when no symbols of a certain type appear when a certain winning combination occurs or regardless of the visible symbols at random or fixed intervals. Referring to in accordance with one embodiment of the invention three RACE symbols scattered from left to right on reels and may trigger play of a feature game. The availability of the feature game may be restricted based on the size of the wager or a percentage of each wager may be explicitly allocated to the funding of the feature games.

In accordance with one or more embodiments illustrates a feature game having a horserace bonus game played according to rules described on . The game provides a carnival style horse racing bonus game wherein the player gets unlimited free spins until at least one of five horses arrives at the finish line. In accordance with one or more embodiments the player collects regular line pays during the free spins according to the pay table illustrated in . Each horse has an associated icon that appears on one and only one of the five reels. per Horses move one space forward any time their associated icon appears on a reel during free spins. During the free spins horse movement symbols advance indicators showing the position of each horse. During the race the game provides audio in the form of race announcer banter during each horse movement. The commentary is unique for each race as it takes into account actual horse positioning after every movement.

Free spins continue until at least one horse completes the trip to the finish line. For example once at least one horse has moved 4 spaces it reaches the finish line and the free spins stop. The player collects all line win pays up to that point. The player is also awarded the progressive award associated with the horse that reached the finish line first. If multiple horses finish at the same time a Photo Finish event takes place that determines that the race ended in a dead heat. All horses that finished will have their progressives awarded to the player provided the player placed a maximum wager otherwise other values may be paid. 

The progressive awards may be calculated by a progressive controller such as a controller manufactured by Mikohn Inc. The progressive controller monitors wagering during base game play calculates a current value for one or more progressive jackpot pools and transmits the current pool values to the gaming machine. In one or more embodiments progressive awards are accumulated during regular play as a percentage such as three percent of the game play take. The prizes may be sized according to the preferences of the casino operator. The number of prizes may vary without deviating from the scope of the invention. The size of the prizes is dependent on the amount of play prior to initiating feature play and may come from the contributions of a single gaming machine or a number of linked gaming machines. In another aspect the prizes may be set amounts established by the casino operator from non coin in funds such as marketing funds. The probability of winning one of the progressives may be dependent on the size of the wager made by the player with a larger wager making it more likely that a progressive will be won. Alternately the progressive prize awarded may be a percentage of the total progressive pool the percentage based on wager size.

In one or more embodiments the prizes for progressive awards may be accumulated based on funding mechanisms other than a percentage of wagers accumulated by the gaming machine. For example an operator may initially fund various award pools with a pre determined amount of money such as 1 000 for the red horse s progressive 100 for the white horse s progressive and so on. Subsequently the casino operator may determine to increase the amounts of one or more of the awards at pre determined times which may be periodically or randomly selected with a range of times or periods. Once a winner has occurred at any level the award levels may be rolled back to their initial funding amount. In one or more embodiments only the winning award level is rolled back to the initial funding amount.

In one or more embodiments the awards assigned to each winning horse may be set amounts i.e. non progressive. In some embodiments the algorithms to determine the amounts may be determined by a statistical percentage based on an average take of a gaming machine and the likelihood of the win over a period of time. In the case where one or more gaming machines are networked a common award table may be utilized where the award algorithms are determined based on an average take total wagers of all the networked gaming machines and the likelihood of a win of an award over a period of time. Each award may be calculated in a similar manner based on the likelihood of a winning outcome being achieved during a game play session.

The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to EGM Processor Board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board PID and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having a horserace bonus feature game as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board executes a game program that causes processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having a horserace bonus feature game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during startup from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

Still referring to a player may initiate primary game play at step on a gaming machine including the bonus feature. Play of the primary game occurs as normal with the player being played according to the primary game outcome at step . At step the method checks to see if the feature game has been triggered. As discussed above in one embodiment the feature or bonus game is triggered when three RACE symbols appear on the reels from left to right. If the feature game has not been triggered then the method returns to step and primary game play continues.

On the other hand if the feature game has been triggered the feature reels are displayed and spun at step . In one embodiment the feature reels differ from the primary game reels because the feature reels do not include RACE symbols or wild card symbols. At step the player receives free spins and the player is paid according to the primary game outcome at the end of each spin at step . If a horse symbol or icon appears on or within one space of the first pay line the method at step advances the representative horse on the screen one space closer to the finish line. The method then checks at step if any of the horses in the feature game have reached the finish line. If no horse has reached the finish line then the player receives another free spin. However if one or more horses have reached the finish line then the player is awarded one or more progressive prizes associated with the horse s that reached the finish line at step . After awarding the progressive s prize the method returns to step .
