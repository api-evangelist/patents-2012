The invention relates to the delivery of multimedia assets to a user. More specifically the invention relates to a method and system for automatically identifying and transmitting video content to an electronic mail client.

There exists an increasing amount of information available in video format from a variety of sources. Known systems and methods for searching video content rely on a search of titles or other metadata to identify entire video broadcasts or video files of potential relevance to a user. Once identified video content is delivered to the user via conventional methods for distribution of the video source. For example a content provider manually directs video content to a user over closed circuit television mails a video tape to a user or manually generates an electronic mail email message with an attached video file.

Known systems and methods for identifying and delivering video content have various disadvantages. For example since known systems and methods for searching video typically identify entire video broadcasts or video files that are of interest to a user a user may need to sort through a relatively large volume of irrelevant information to view a relatively small amount of relevant content. In addition the manual labor associated with delivery of video content to a user may result in delay and or increase the cost of delivery.

Thus there exists a need for systems and methods that identify video source material relevant to the interests of a user and transmit only those portions of the source video containing relevant content to the user in an efficient manner.

The invention relates to a method and system for automatically identifying and transmitting video content to an electronic mail client.

In one exemplary embodiment the invention relates to a method for arranging for delivery of content from a video source including automatically identifying a portion of at least one source video stream using a predetermined user profile transforming the identified portion of the at least one source video stream into a destination medium and automatically building an electronic mail message based on the destination medium and the identified portion of the at least one source video.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for arranging for the delivery of content from a video source including automatically identifying a portion of at least one source video stream based on relevance to a predetermined user profile transforming the identified portion of the at least one source video stream into at least a thumbnail image and closed caption text and automatically building an electronic mail message using the thumbnail image and the closed caption text.

In another embodiment the invention provides a system for arranging the delivery of content to an electronic mail client including at least one video source a user profile database and a server coupled to the video source and the user profile database wherein the server is configured to read profile data from the user profile database automatically identify a portion of the at least one video source using the profile data transform the identified portion of the at least one video source into a destination medium and automatically build an electronic mail message using the destination medium.

In another embodiment the invention provides a computer readable storage medium configured to provide a graphical user interface for an electronic mail client the graphical user interface including a management feature for managing a plurality of electronic mail messages based on metadata wherein the metadata includes at least one of broadcast source broadcast date and duration information related to at least one corresponding source video for each of the plurality of electronic mail messages and a view feature for viewing a selected portion of the at least one corresponding source video and a medium derived from a selected portion of the at least one corresponding source video.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for creating an electronic mail message for delivery of video information to a user including selecting video information from at least one source video stream using user profile information formatting the selected video information in accordance with the profile information and populating fields of an electronic message with formatted video information and destination information in accordance with the user profile information.

The features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following drawings and detailed description.

While the invention is described below with respect to various exemplary embodiments the invention is not limited to only those embodiments that are disclosed. Other embodiments can be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The invention solves the above discussed problems and provides a personalized customizable multimedia delivery service that is convenient and easy to use. In one embodiment of the invention the service works by recording all of the video streams of appropriate source and interest to a target audience. For example the service may record content from a collection of or a particular one of sports or news channels on television. In another example the service may record content related to training videos presentations or executive meetings in a business school or other particularized environment. Recording may occur as the content is originally being broadcast i.e. live afterwards from recorded media or even before the content is broadcast to its intended audience.

Once the content is captured and recorded it can be segmented analyzed and or classified and thereafter stored on a platform. For example the content can be broken down into its component parts such as video audio and or text. The text can include for example closed caption text associated with the original transmission text generated from an audio portion by speech recognition software or a transcription of the audio portion created before or after the transmission. In the latter case it becomes possible to utilize the invention in conjunction with executive speeches conferences corporate training business TV advertising and many other sources of video which do not typically have available an associated textual basis for searching the video.

Having obtained or generated the text it can then be used as a basis for searching the multimedia content. In particular the text provides the basis for an exemplary methodology for overcoming the above identified problems associated with searching video in the prior art. That is if a user wishes to search the stored content for video segments relevant to the President of the United States discussing a particular topic then the President s name and the associated topic can be searched for within the text associated with the video segments. Whenever the President s name and the associated topic are located an algorithm can be used to determine which portion of an entire video file actually pertains to the desired content and should therefore be extracted for delivery to the user. Thus if a video file comprises an entire news broadcast about a number of subjects the user will receive only those portions of the broadcast if any that pertain to the President and the particular topic desired. For example this could include segments in which the President talks about the topic or segments in which another talks about the topic and the President s position.

Once the pertinent segments of the broadcast have been appropriately extracted for a given user they can be stitched together for continuous delivery to that user. In this way for example the segments can be streamed to the user as a means of providing an easy to use delivery methodology for the user and as a means of conserving bandwidth. Users can view the delivered multimedia asset in its entirety skip between the assets or view only portions of the assets as they desire. Moreover a user can have access to portions of the original video file that occurred immediately before or after the extracted segments for example the user could choose to watch the entire original video file. Such access can be granted by including a more or complete button in a user interface.

In one embodiment of the invention a profile of the user is stored which specifies criteria for searching available multimedia assets. The criteria may include for example key words and or phrases a source s of the content etc. The profile can be set directly by the user via interaction with an appropriately designed graphical user interface GUI . When such a profile is available the invention is capable of automatically searching the available assets on a periodic basis and thereafter extracting combining and delivering the compiled assets or segments thereof regardless of their original source to the user. In one embodiment the invention can be utilized such that a service platform assisting in implementing the invention notifies the user whenever new multimedia assets consistent with the user s profile have been prepared. In another embodiment the invention may automatically deliver multimedia assets in accordance with a user s profile according to a predetermined schedule such as hourly or daily. Alternatively the invention may notify the user of the presence of desired video clips rather than actually deliver those clips.

The assets can be classified and indexed on the fly as they are received. In this way the assets can be compared against the user s profile virtually in real time so that results can be provided to the user and the user can be notified whenever they become available. Furthermore a user can provide criteria for a search or searches beyond those set in the user s profile.

The identified assets can be delivered to the user in a variety of manners. For example delivery may occur via cable or satellite television or directly to a personal computer. The invention can be practiced via a plurality of platforms and networks. For example the invention may be practiced over the Internet to reach a large consumer audience or it may be practiced over an Intranet to reach a highly targeted business or industry target.

In one embodiment the invention allows video streaming of identified video clips. Video streaming i.e. allowing the viewing of a video clip as it is downloaded rather than only after it is downloaded which speeds the viewing process and largely obviates the need for video storage at the user location is a communications technique that is growing in popularity with the increasing availability of both video players especially for use with personal computers and bandwidth to the average consumer. However no conventional service allows users to accurately and quickly find desired clips for playing and do not provide a ready means for providers to profit from the video streams that are provided.

When streaming the identified video clips users may receive only those video clips identified by a search executed on the user s behalf. However if a user desires he or she may also choose to view an entire program from which the clip s was extracted. A user may also be allowed to choose some or all of the video clips for long term storage whereby the clip s can be archived for later use. In one embodiment the user may store the clips at a local computer and thereafter make the clips available to other users connected via a peer to peer network.

In another embodiment the invention allows improved video on demand VOD . VOD is typically defined in the cable satellite television arena as the ability to request programming at any time and to have VCR like controls over the content being streamed to the TV. The invention adds value to conventional VOD by allowing the user to demand video more accurately and completely.

An extension to VOD is personal video recorder PVR technology which allows even more control over TV programs being viewed. Current PVR implementations are offered by TiVo and ReplayTV and allow users great flexibility in storing programs for later viewing and or manipulation in viewing e.g. skipping over commercials in a television program . The invention provides a searching tool for allowing users to find interesting programs even from a variety of channel sources to thereafter be recorded and viewed using PVR technology.

Moreover whereas conventional PVR records only entire programs based on a user s directions the invention permits the recording of only those portions of programs that the user desires. In this regard the invention contemplates recording the desired portions either by doing so directly from the program or by recording the entire program locally and then utilizing only those portions of the program desired by the user.

Having described various exemplary embodiments of the invention it should be noted that the terms video file video input video video program or any similar term refers generically to any analog or digital video information including any content associated therewith such as multimedia content closed caption text etc. The terms clip video clip electronic clip or eClip should be understood to refer to any subsection of a video program that is selected based on a user search criterion. Also the terms extracting parsing removing accessing or any similar term with respect to a video file refers to the use of a selected portion of the video file. Such use may include literal removal permanent or temporary from the context of a larger file copying of the selected portion for external use or any other method for utilizing the selected portion.

Based on the above described features of the invention a user may accurately completely and promptly receive multimedia assets that he or she finds interesting and may conveniently exploit the received assets in a manner best suited to that user.

In multimedia assets including video associated text captions and corresponding audio portions are imported into the system for processing. Content based sampling engine receives the video and segments it into individual shots or video frames this information will be combined with information extracted from the other components of the video program to enable the extraction of individual stories i.e. video segments related to a particular topic or topics as will be described. Additionally this process allows a representative image for a particular story segment or clip to be selected by engine and second the process allows boundaries around the story segment or clip to be set by engine .

A database of linguistic rules is used by linguistic analysis engine to combine the caption information with the segmented video within engines and to thereby assist in the functionality of those two engines. Similarly information within model databases and is used by acoustic classification engine and program identification engine to provide segmentation identification of commercials and programs respectively. Once the multimedia asset s have been captured segmented and classified as described above they can be stored thereafter in DVL database .

All of the information from engines is utilized in engines and to discern a length of a particular video story or clip that will be associated with each topic. In particular for example multimodal story segmentation algorithms such as those described in Automated Generation of News Content Hierarchy By Integrating Audio Video and Text Information above can be used to determine an appropriate length of a video clip to be associated with a particular topic. Similarly the algorithm can be used in conjunction with the user profile to either compare the profile information to newly acquired content on the fly or to similarly determine an appropriate length for a video clip to be associated with a particular portion of the user profile.

As referred to above textual information used to identify clips of interest can be derived for example from closed caption text that accompanies most television programs. Real time closed captioning typically lags behind the audio and video by a variable amount of time from about 1 to 10 seconds. To take this factor into account the embodiment of is capable of using speech processing to generate very accurate word timestamps.

When closed caption text is not available a large vocabulary automatic speech recognition system can be used to generate a transcript of the audio track. While the accuracy of the automatically generated transcripts is below that of closed captions they provide a reasonable alternative for identifying clips of interest with reduced but acceptable accuracy. Alternatively a parallel text alignment algorithm can be used to import high quality off line transcripts of the program when they are or become available.

In Video Capture Media Analysis component records and compresses broadcast TV programming. Also at component various functions can be performed on the content such as scene change detection audio analysis and compression. These video files are shipped to the Video Storage database from which they will be served when the video is streamed to the client .

Associated metadata is shipped to the Metadata database . Note that thumbnail images are included as part of the metadata as well as terms and or phrases associated with a clip s for categorizing the clip s within a topical subset. Typically this video capture media analysis process need not occur in real time. However there is no reason why it could not occur in real time if an operator so desires and wishes to devote sufficient computational resources. In any case it is not necessary to wait until a show is completed before indexing and searching that show.

Video Server responds to clip requests and makes the video content available to the client . For example the video server may download the video clips in whole or in part stream the clips e.g. via MPEG4 ASF or MPEG2 to the client or generate the clip metadata discussed above such as terms and or phrases associated with a clip for categorizing the clip within a topical subset .

DVL Server handles query requests such as how many clips are available which shows have clips etc. and or clip content requests metadata that describes clip content including clip pointer to video content . Thus it handles multimedia search such as closed caption text and determines the start and stop times of the clips which are designated with clip pointers as just mentioned.

eClips server handles client requests for web pages related to a service for providing eClips. eClips server utilizes Perl Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts that the client navigates in order to perform the functions of the eClips service. For example the scripts deal with login registration related pages home page profile related pages archive related pages player pages and administration related pages. Player scripts can be launched in a separate window. Each CGI request from the client will return HTML with HTML DIVs JavaScript and CSS style sheets. The DIVs and CSS style sheets are used to position the various elements of the page. DHTML is used to dynamically load DIV content on the fly for instance a list of shows in an instant search pull down performed by a user .

In three databases and are shown as Extensible Markup Language XML databases. Thus Perl scripts can be utilized to access i.e. read from and or write to these databases via XML. Specifically these three databases include show database which contains information about recorded broadcasts Profile database which contains personal search terms and or phrases and Archive database which contains saved clip information e.g. entire clips or simply clip pointers .

eClips Client in one embodiment includes a JavaScript that each Perl script includes in the HTML that is returned from the eClips server . It is through the JavaScript that the client interacts with the DVL server to determine the desired content and through JavaScript that the client initiates the streaming content with the video server . The JavaScript also accesses reads the Show and Profile XML files in those databases.

The Video Server may have a separate IP host name and should support HTTP streaming. The DVL and eClips servers and may have the same IP host name and may be collocated within a single machine.

In the key interactions that cause video to be streamed to the client are demonstrated. In a home page view a user has logged in already and should see a list of topics determined by their profile as well as the number of clips for each topic. An example of a topic could be sports and the keyword string associated with this topic could be football baseball hockey. The keyword string is used to search the CC text in this case clips that have any of these terms will be valid .

When the home page is loaded JavaScript will send a CGI query to DVL server which generates an XML response. The XML is parsed into JavaScript variables on the client using the XML document object model DOM . The CGI query and XML response is implemented as part of the DVL system and acts as a layer above an Index Server which as part of the DVL server performs text indexing of the video clips as discussed above that allows the user to locate a desired clip. The XML response will include the number of clips found for each topic. It is with these query responses that the home page knows which topics have hits and can activate the links to play the content.

These JavaScript links when clicked can launch the player page in a separate window. When the player page is loaded essentially the same JavaScript can be used to recalculate the number of clips for each topic. In principle this could be changed to calculate this only once and to pass this on to the player script thereafter. The JavaScript may also run a query to get the list of shows with clips for a particular topic. The JavaScript then loops through all the shows with hits and queries the DVL server via the separate CGI script to get the clip information needed to play the clip. This information is also returned via XML and parsed via the JavaScript. The JavaScript loads various DIVs that depend on this information such as hit search term found in CC text CC text and thumbnail. Finally the player page JavaScript starts the media player with the first clip using a pointer start time to the video. It should be noted that in one embodiment of the invention the just described process is almost completely automated so that dynamic clip extraction occurs when a clip is selected and a show automatically starts and will play completely through if not interrupted by the user.

In the architecture shown in eClips client may reside on for example a user s home or business computer a personal digital assistant PDA or a set top box on a user s television set. Client interacts with eClips server as discussed above to provide the user with an interface for viewing and utilizing the video clips. Client can be written to contain for example a JavaScript object that contains profile results eClips object . A user using eClips client running on a PC may access stored clips through a network such as the Internet or a locally defined Intranet.

In one embodiment the user defines a search criterion either through an instant search feature or within a user profile. When multiple clips are found matching the user search the clips can be stitched together and streamed to the user as one continuous program. In another embodiment eClips server periodically searches for clips matching a given user s profile and makes the clips available to the user perhaps by notifying the user via email of the availability of the clips.

The architecture shown in allows for video to be stored and displayed in several formats including MPEG2 e.g. for digital television and video on demand and MPEG4 e.g. for streaming video on the Internet . As mentioned above the video may be stored for later use by the user in particular a user may archive some or all of the received video and thereafter permit searching and uploading of the video from storage by other members of a peer to peer computer network.

Within user home the feed is received at cable modem via high speed data line HSD to a PC running eClips client . Alternatively the feed could be sent to Set top box atop TV where Set top box runs eClips client . In the example where the video clips are received via cable modem the service can be streamed as high speed data HSD through a cable modem as MPEG4 video. When the video is received via Set top box it can be delivered as MPEG2 over video on demand VOD channels that could be set up in advance for a service providing the invention.

Section also identifies a source for the criteria used to select the various topical clips. More specifically on a profile page a user can select default sources shows which will be searched based on the user s profile this is referred to as a Main list and would restrict any profile topic that has the Main option to search only those shows selected on the profile page. On a topic editor page where a user is allowed to add or modify topics for searching the user can specify this Main list or can make Custom selections that are only valid for a particular search topic. In section the user has selected the latter option and so a source is shown as Custom.

In section the user additionally has the option of entering new search terms and or phrases not related to his or her current profile whereby the invention searches a clips database via DVL server as described above with respect to . Section indicates the media sources which will be searched for the terms or phrases entered in section .

Also in page view button Play all clips allows a user to view all currently available clips with one click. The user can add a new topic using button . The user can return to a home page by clicking on button although this option is only valid when the user is on a page different from the home page itself access his profile via button and access an archive of previously saved clips via button . Finally a user can log out of the service using button .

When one or more of these clips is chosen for viewing by the user that clip is shown in section . Section can be controlled by buttons which allow a user to skip to a previous clip with button stop the clip with button play the clip with button skip the clip with button switch to a new topic of clips with button or view footage after the selected clip s with button . Note that section may also include advertisements and may display a time remaining for a currently playing clip a source of the clip and a date and time the clip was originally broadcast.

In one exemplary embodiment of the invention page will play all of the clips currently available in a predetermined order e.g. reverse chronological order by source of content etc. if the user does not choose a specific topic or clip. Button is activated when a user wants to view the clip s available i.e. as shown in view . Button allows the user to send e.g. email the clip s to another user and button allows the user to save the clip s to an archive i.e. the archive accessed by button in .

Having discussed various exemplary embodiments of the invention and associated features thereof as well as potential uses of the invention the following provides a more detailed summary of application categories in which the invention is of use.

Generally speaking because the invention can capture content from nearly any multimedia source and then use standard streaming media to deliver the appropriate associated clips it is nearly limitless in the markets and industries that it can support.

As a practical matter the invention can be packaged to address different market segments. Therefore it should be assumed that the target markets and applications supported could fall into for example any or all of the Consumer Business to Consumer or Business to Business Marketplaces. The following discussion summarizes some exemplary application categories.

First as a consumer offering the invention can be provided as an extension to standard television programming. In this model an ISP Cable Programming Provider Web Portal Provider etc. may allow consumers to sign up for this service or the set of features provided by the invention can be provided as a premium subscription.

In the consumer service model a consumer would enter a set of keywords and or phrases in the profile. In addition as part of the preferences selected in the profile the user may determine that only specific content sources should be monitored. As the user profile is created or changed it would be updated in the user profile database. As video content is captured in the system the user profile database is matched against the closed caption text. As an example a consumer may be interested in sports but only want to see the specific play of the day. In this scenario the consumer would enter the key words play of the day and then identify in the profile the specific content sources channels or programs that should be recorded analyzed by the invention. For example the consumer could choose channels that play sports games or report on sports news. When the consumer returns from work that evening a site or channel for accessing the invention would be accessed. This consumer would then see all of the clips of programs that matched the keywords play of the day meaning that this consumer would see in one session all of the content and clips matching that set of words.

As another example in a Business to Consumer offering the invention can be provided as an extension to standard television programming. In this case both the programming and its sponsorship would be different from the consumer model above. For example a corporate sponsor or numerous corporate sponsors may offer specific types of content or may offer an assemblage of content overlaid with advertising sponsorship. The sponsorship would be evident in the advertising that would be embedded in the player or in the content since the design of the invention is modular in design and allows for customization.

In the Business to Consumer service model a consumer would enter a set of keywords in the profile. As the user profile is created or changed it would be updated in the user profile database. Because this model and the content provided would be underwritten by corporate sponsorship the content provided may be limited to a proprietary set of content. As an example if CNN were the sponsor of the service all of the content provided may be limited to CNN s own broadcasts. In addition it may be very evident to the consumer that the service is brought to them by CNN in that the CNN logo may be embedded in the user interface or may be embedded in the content itself.

Next as a Business to Business offering the invention can be used in intra company applications as well as extra company applications. The applications supported include as just a few examples Business TV Advertising Executive Announcements Financial News Training Competitive Information Services Industry Conferences etc. In essence the invention can be used as a tool to assist employees in retrieving and viewing specific portions of content on demand.

In this Business to Business service model a user would enter a set of keywords in the profile that would be updated in the user profile database. In this case the content captured will be dependent upon the business audience using the service.

In an intra business application the user may wish to combine sources from within the business and sources outside of the business. As an example a user may wish to see all clips dealing with the category Virtual Private Networks. In this example a business may have planned a new advertising campaign talking about Virtual Private Networks and have an advertisement available to its internal personnel. At the same time there may be an internal training class that has been recorded and is available internally in which a section talks about Virtual Private Networks. Again this could be another content option captured by the invention. Also one of this company s competitors may have provided a talk at an industry conference the day before about their solution for the Virtual Private Network area. As with the other content options this too could be captured and available as a content option through the invention. Therefore when our user begins a session using the invention and looks under the term Virtual Private Networks there could be numerous clips available from multiple sources internal and external to provide this user with a complete multimedia view of Virtual Private Networks .

As an extra business tool the invention can provide businesses their suppliers their best customers and all other members of communities of interests with specific targeted content clips that strengthen the relationships. These may include but not be limited to product details new announcements public relations messages etc.

As further examples of applications of the invention the following represent industry applications which may benefit from use of the invention.

In the financial industry financial information can be available for both professionals and potential clients to receive late breaking information on stocks companies and the global markets. The information can be from a variety of sources such as Financial News Network Bloomberg CNN etc. and allow users to identify key areas of interest and to continually be up to date.

In the advertising announcements industry advertisers would be able to target their ads to consumers based on peoples preferences as expressed in their profiles. This is potentially a win win situation because people would not be getting any more ads but they would be seeing more things that interest them. Advertisers could charge more for this targeted approach and thereby pay for any costs associated with the invention.

Similarly large companies run TV advertisements for a multitude of products services target markets etc. These companies could benefit by housing these commercials on an on line database that can be accessible to their marketing staff the advertising agencies and clients interested in seeing particular commercials that used specific words or product names. The invention can then allow these commercials to be easily searched and accessed.

In the entertainment industry the movie industry can use the invention to easily scan through archives of old and new movie footage that can be digitized and stored in a central repository. Sports highlights can be made available for particular games or events. Networks could maintain a library of indexed TV shows e.g. PBS where users can search for a particular episode topic.

In the travel industry searches can be done on new information in the travel industry such as airlines causes of delays etc. In addition the invention can be used to provide key clips from specific resorts and other potential vacation destinations.

In the distance learning education industry a large variety of courses could be stored on line. In many circumstances a user may want to only see the salient points on a specific topic of interest. The invention can then play a key role in providing support to the user for access and retrieval of the key needed information.

For conferences and trade events the invention can be an information dissemination tool for finding the latest information quickly when videos are captured of talks and demonstrations in key events.

In one embodiment at least portions of source video are transformed to other media formats to be delivered to a user instead of or in addition to the identified relevant portions of the source video. is a flow diagram illustrating transformation of video source data according to one embodiment of the invention. illustrates several alternative transformation paths to deliver content of video source to destination devices . As used herein video source data may be live streaming video delayed streaming video or stored video data.

Sampling function processes video source data to produce static images . In an embodiment where video source data is streaming video capture process produces a video file from video source data . Static images or video files are then delivered to destination devices .

In addition illustrates that extraction process generates Closed Caption Text CCT from video source data . Process corrects for errors in CCT provides language translation and or performs other translations to generate processed CCT . Processed CCT may be delivered directly to destination devices . In the alternative text to speech process operates on either CCT or processed CCT to produce audio stream with at least all transformation paths available as described above with regard to audio stream for eventual delivery to destination devices . It is also possible to transform from video file to sound file via a demultiplexing process not shown .

Destination devices may be or include for example a personal computer PC a tablet PC a personal digital assistant PDA a smart phone or other device capable of receiving email.

Transformed content may be delivered to destination devices according to alternative timing schemes. For example CCT processed CCT audio stream text processed text may be delivered in near real time e.g. where content delivery is delayed only by processing and communication overhead . In other embodiments transformed content is stored for later delivery. Moreover the timing for delivery of stored content may be according to a predetermined schedule such as a set time of day. In addition or in the alternative content can be delivered according to a set interval of time such as every hour or other fixed period of time. The predetermined schedule may be specified in the user s profile data. In addition or in the alternative the delivery of near real time and or stored content may be event triggered. For instance a user profile may specify that breaking headline news special reports and or severe weather warnings trigger near real time delivery of content separate from or together with related stored content.

Sample process demultiplexing process extraction process text to speech process speech recognition process capture processes and and processes and may be performed on a server or other network based host computer having access to video source data .

In one embodiment of step one or more URL s or other links are included in the body of the email message pointing to a Web page containing the video content or to a Web page that causes a media player to be launched. In an another embodiment of step the video content is attached to the email message as one or more multimedia files. In yet another embodiment of step one or more metafiles are attached to the email message.

Metafiles are small text files that contain information about media files including media file location and optionally include information such as author or artist start time and duration. Examples of metafiles are Microsoft Windows Advanced Stream Redirector .asx files Microsoft Windows Media Audio Redirector .wax files Microsoft Windows Media Redirector .wvx files and Real Networks Real Audio Metafile .ram files. The application of metafiles has many advantages. For example because a metafile can specify several different locations for a media stream the delivery of video content can be fault tolerant. In addition a metafile can define a series of media streams to be played in sequence to form a larger aggregate presentation from a collection of smaller video streams. Also because metafiles can specify a start and a duration shorter segments of interest can be specified within a longer media file. Moreover since metafiles are small text files emails having metafile attachments are more easily downloaded and stored than emails having large video files attachments for example.

Many alternatives to the process flow of are possible.
