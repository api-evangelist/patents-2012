The present invention relates to a data processing technology and more particularly to mobile information devices and a content display method therefor.

There are community websites providing a service in which photographs are posted by site users and thus shared by a plurality of users hereinafter referred to as photo sharing site . By accessing a photo sharing site the users can browse the photographs having been shot by the other users and post their comments or the like on the photos they have browsed.

Mobile information devices combining a display and a touch panel are now in wide spread use. Generally the display size of mobile information devices is smaller than that of stationary information processing devices. However when an electronic content such as a photograph is to be displayed on a mobile information device it is necessary to provide a content display area of an adequate size to facilitate the recognition of the content by the user. Hence when an icon to accept user operation is to be displayed together with the content on the display screen of the mobile information device the display size of the icon is subject to limitation thus rendering the icon less operable.

The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing circumstances and the main purpose thereof is to provide a technology to maintain the operability of an icon displayed together with an electronic content on a mobile information device.

In order to resolve the aforementioned problems a mobile information device according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a first display control unit configured to display data of a content item selected by a user in a first region of a screen a second display control unit configured to adjacently arrange a plurality of icons through which the user selects the content item displayed in the first region and configured to display the plurality of icons in a second region of the screen an operation detector configured to detect a selection operation performed by the user for an icon displayed in the second region and a pop up display control unit configured to display in a forefront manner information on the selected icon in a third region of the screen when the selection operation is detected. The operation detector detects as the selection operation a drag operation by the user over the plurality of icons displayed in the second region the pop up display control unit sequentially switches among information on the plurality of icons selected sequentially by the drag operation so as to be displayed sequentially in the third region and when a predetermined operation is detected for an icon located in a position where the drag operation ends the first display control unit switches the content item displayed in the first region to a content item associated with the icon located in the position where the drag operation ends.

Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a content display method. This method is one executed by a mobile information device and the method includes displaying a content item to be selected by a user on a screen adjacently arranging a plurality of icons through which the user selects the content item to be displayed and displaying the plurality of icons on the screen switching among information on the plurality of icons selected sequentially by a drag operation so as to display the information sequentially on a predetermined region of the screen when the drag operation is detected over the plurality of icons and switching the content item displayed on the screen to a content item associated with an icon located in a position where the drag operation ends when a predetermined operation is detected on said icon located in the position where the drag operation ends.

Optional combinations of the aforementioned constituting elements and implementations of the invention in the form of apparatuses methods systems computer programs recording media that store the programs and so forth may also be practiced as additional modes of the present invention.

The invention will now be described by reference to the preferred embodiments. This does not intend to limit the scope of the present invention but to exemplify the invention.

The photo sharing server is a server for providing services of a photo sharing site. The photo sharing server manages photographs uploaded from client devices such as mobile game devices PCs and smartphones and information on the users of those devices. And the photo sharing server delivers electronic contents including those photographs and information in response to the requests from those client devices. The photo sharing server which has typically the functions of a web server sends and receives data by the HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol communication to and from the client devices.

Hereinbelow a detailed description will be given of a mobile game device running on an application software providing client functions for a photo sharing site that is a photo viewing application supporting ready viewing of an electronic content offered by the photo sharing server . Note however that the photo viewing application is not limited to the use with the mobile game device but it is widely applicable to various mobile information devices with touch panel such as mobile phones smartphones tablet terminals personal digital assistants PDAs and the like.

A menu list screen which is an initial screen top screen to be displayed right after the activation of the photo viewing application displays a menu list from which a user can make a menu selection. The menu list screen will be described later in connection with . An individual menu screen is a screen displaying a detailed content of a menu when a specific menu has been selected on the menu list screen . The individual menu screen will be described later in connection with . Hereinbelow the menu list screen and the individual menu screen will be collectively referred to as home screen also.

A user screen is a screen for displaying a content concerning users when a user category menu is selected on the home screen e.g. when a user category icon is tapped . The user screen will be described later in connection with . A search result screen is a screen for displaying the results of a search for a photo sharing site when a search request has been inputted on the home screen . Hereinbelow the user screen and the search result screen will be collectively referred to as list screen also.

A photo information screen is a screen for displaying detailed information on a photograph when a specific photograph is selected on the home screen or the list screen e.g. when a specific photo image is tapped . The photo information screen will be described later in connection with . A full screen viewer is a screen for displaying a photograph identified on the photo information screen full screen on the display device .

Each block shown in the block diagrams of the present patent specification may be achieved hardwarewise by elements and mechanical devices such as a CPU memory and the like of a computer and softwarewise by computer programs and the like. Depicted herein are functional blocks implemented by cooperation of hardware and software. Therefore it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the functional blocks may be implemented by a variety of manners including hardware only software only or a combination of both.

The photo viewing application for example may include program modules compatible with the data storage unit and the control unit of . Also the arrangement may be such that the functions of the respective blocks of the control unit are carried out as the program modules corresponding to the respective blocks stored in a storage such as flash memory are read out as appropriate to the main memory for execution by the CPU. Also the functions of the respective blocks of the data storage unit may be carried out with data stored in a storage such as flash memory or main memory.

The communication processing unit transmits and receives data to and from the photo sharing server via the communication network in response to the requests from a content acquiring unit and a posting processing unit to be described later.

The data storage unit which is a storage area of various data includes an icon information storage unit . The icon information storage unit stores information on a plurality of icons to be displayed on the display device such as icon images caption in other words explanatory text or supplemental information for icons and display positions coordinates or the like of icons for instance. Note that the data storage unit also stores such contents as photo images and texts acquired from the photo sharing server .

The control unit includes an operation detector a screen change control unit a content acquiring unit a display control unit an information input supporting unit and a posting processing unit .

The operation detector detects operations by the user on the input unit and the touch panel . In the preferred embodiments it is assumed that the user operates the touch panel with his her finger. The operation detector detects a touch operation when the user s finger touches the touch panel and a release operation when the user s finger leaves the touch panel . In particular the operation detector detects a tap operation when the interval between a touch operation and a release operation is short less than a predetermined time interval typically when the user taps the touch panel . Also the operation detector detects a long touch operation when a release operation is not detected for a predetermined time e.g. 500 ms or longer after the detection of a touch operation.

Also the operation detector detects a trace operation when the user traces the touch panel with a finger without releasing it immediately. The trace operation is also referred to as the slide operation or drag operation . Moreover the operation detector even detects a short slide operation in a manner of flicking the touch panel as a flick operation . The operation detector also obtains from the touch panel the coordinates indicating the position where any of the various operations on the touch panel took place. The operation detector is capable of distinguishing between the operation by the user on the touch panel the position of the operation and the object icon or the like on the screen upon which the operation has been performed.

The screen change control unit sends an instruction for a screen change to the display control unit according to the kind of operation detected by the operation detector and the rules of screen change shown in . For example if a tap operation on a specific photo image is detected during the display of the home screen or the list screen the screen change control unit gives an instruction to the display control unit to cause a display of the photo information screen for the photo image. Also if a tap operation on a user category icon is detected during the display of the home screen the screen change control unit gives an instruction to the display control unit to cause a display of the user screen . The screen change control unit also communicates identification information on the screen after the screen change to the content acquiring unit thereby allowing the content acquiring unit to acquire an electronic content to be displayed on the screen after the screen change from the photo sharing server .

The content acquiring unit acquires an electronic content e.g. photo image text data of comment tag user profile etc. held by the photo sharing server by accessing the photo sharing server and calling an API Application Programming Interface made public by the photo sharing site. For example the content acquiring unit acquires the photo images and the titles of photographs posted recently by a user or users by calling an API for the acquisition of those photographs. Also the content acquiring unit may for instance acquire the photo images and the titles of a list of photographs called a photo stream also associated with the users on the photo sharing site by calling an API for their acquisition.

The information input supporting unit executes processings designed to support the input of information by the user related to any of the various screens displayed on the display device . More specifically when an operation indicating a request for information input is detected the information input supporting unit causes a display of a software keyboard on the screen and sends a character string specified by the user through the software keyboard to the display control unit thereby causing a relevant screen display.

The posting processing unit uploads the photo images shot by a user or users to the photo sharing server by accessing the photo sharing server and calling an API made public by the photo sharing site. Similarly the posting processing unit uploads the text data of comment or tag prepared by the user relative to a photograph or photographs he she has viewed to the photo sharing server .

The display control unit causes a display on the display device of the various screens in a photo viewing application as shown in by setting each screen data thereon according to the operation by the user. The display control unit includes a home screen display control unit a user screen display control unit a photo information screen display control unit and a full screen display control unit . Although not shown in the display control unit may further include a search result display unit for displaying the result of a search for the photo sharing server .

The home screen display control unit causes a display of the menu list screen or the individual menu screen by setting the screen data thereon. The user screen display control unit causes a display of the user screen by setting the screen data thereon. The photo information screen display control unit causes a display of the photo information screen by setting the screen data thereon.

The full screen display control unit causes a display of the full screen viewer by setting the screen data thereon. More specifically when a predetermined operation such as a tap on a photo image on the photo information screen is detected the full screen display control unit causes a full screen display on the display device of the photo image displayed on the photo information screen .

The search category display control unit sets the display data for the search category area . More specifically a search character string field and a search button are displayed in the search category area

The posting category display control unit sets the display data for the recent upload category area . More specifically a plurality of photo images obtained by the content acquiring unit which are recently posted by a user or users are placed and displayed side by side within a single line in descending order of posting date and time. illustrates a state where six photo images of A to F are displayed. When a user s flick operation is detected on the display area of the display images the posting category display control unit slides and displays the photo images in the flicked direction. For example in response to a flick operation to the left the current display of the photo images of A B C D E and F is now updated to the display of the photo images of D E F G H and I .

The explore category display control unit sets the display data for the explore category area . More specifically a plurality of photo images obtained from the content acquiring unit are placed and displayed side by side within a single line. Here the photo images are photos acquired by calling an API for use in the explore and therefore they may be thought of as the photos included in the user s photo stream. illustrates a state where six photo images of 1 to 6 are displayed. When a user s flick operation is detected on the display area of the photo images the explore category display control unit slides and displays the photo images in the flicked direction similarly to the posting category display control unit .

Note that a slide display of photo images in the posting category area and a slide display of photo images in the explore category area are done independently of each other. That is when a flick operation on a photo image in the posting category area is detected the posting category display control unit slides the photo images but the explore category display control unit does not slide the photo images and maintains the display contents before the flick operation. When a flick operation on a photo image in the explore category area is detected the explore category display control unit slides the photo images but the posting category display control unit does not slide the photo images and maintains the display contents before the flick operation.

The user category display control unit sets the display data for the user category area . More specifically a photo list icon and an album list icon are displayed in the user category area . When a user s tap operation on the photo list icon is detected the screen changes to the user screen indicating a user s photo list. Also when a user s tap operation on the album list icon is detected the screen changes to the user screen indicating a user s album list. Although shows that there are two icons in the user category area eight icons corresponding to content specifying icons described later may be displayed in the user category area

Also all parts of the menu list screen may not be simultaneously displayed within the screen of the display device . For example part of the category areas of may be displayed while the remaining part thereof may not be displayed. The user may perform a slide operation in the vertical direction on the touch panel so as to display the category areas that have been hidden so far. Though not shown in the home screen display control unit may display a background image on the menu list screen and may display the image of each category area in such a manner that the image of each category area is superposed on the background image. In this case when a slide operation in the vertical direction is detected the home screen display control unit slides the image of each category area and also slides the background image independently of the image of each category area . More specifically the displaying is controlled such that the shift amount of the background image as a result of the vertical slide operation is smaller than that of each category area .

Although shows the four categories on the menu list screen other additional menus categories offered by the photo sharing site may be also included in the menu list screen . For example a photo category of recent activity where among the photos posted by a user the favorites or comments are set by other users a category for photos posted by the user s friends an operation history category for the photo sharing site and other categories may further be included therein. The home screen display control unit may further include a function of setting the display data for these additional categories.

Also an open icon by which to enlarge the category area is displayed in each category area . As an open icon is tapped by the user an individual menu screen associated with a category area having the open icon tapped thereby is displayed.

Also the posting category display control unit displays a close icon by which to close the enlarged category i.e. by which to terminate the enlarged display of the category on the individual menu screen . As shown in the close icon is oriented in a reverse direction relative to the open icon . That is the open icon and the close icon are displayed in such a manner that they are identifiable by the user. As a tap operation on the close icon is detected in the individual menu screen the menu list screen is displayed again. A description has been given above of an example related to the posting category display control unit but the display control units for the other categories operate similarly. In other words an individual menu screen for a category selected as a result of a tap operation on the open icon is displayed and the displaying of the individual menu screen is terminated according to a tap operation on the close icon .

As described above the photo images belonging to each menu is displayed in a single line on the menu list screen which is the top screen. This makes it easy for the user to grasp the photos that can be viewed through a selection of each menu and also reduces a burden on the user required until he she finds a desired menu e.g. a burden placed on the user s slide operation . That is under a constraint of limited size of the display device the menu required by the user can be efficiently selected from among a plurality of menus offered by the photo sharing site. Also the photo images belonging to the menu selected by the user are displayed over a plurality of rows lines in the individual menu screen . Thus as many photo images as possible can be simultaneously presented to the user.

The content region display control unit sets the display data for the content region . If the user screen of the user s photo list is to be displayed the content region display control unit will display in the photo sharing site photo images and photo titles related to the user by associating them with each other. If the user screen of the user s album list is to be displayed the content region display control unit will display in the photo sharing site album images and album titles related to the user by associating them with each other.

The operation region display control unit sets the display data for the operation region . The operation region display control unit displays a home icon with which to allow the screen to return to the menu list screen . Also the operation region display control unit places a photo list icon a gallery icon an album list icon a tag list icon a favorite icon an archive icon a friend icon and a profile icon which are generically referred to as content specifying icon or content specifying icons and displays them adjacent to each other. The content region display control unit updates the display content of the content region according to a user s operation to select a content specifying icon .

Also the operation region display control unit displays in a screen explanatory region of the operation region screen explanatory data containing the caption for a content currently being displayed in the content region . The screen explanatory data may be thought of as an explanatory caption for a content specifying icon currently being selected. The operation region display control unit may further display an icon image corresponding to the content being displayed as the screen explanatory data .

As a tap operation on the album list icon is detected in the user screen of the content region display control unit and the operation region display control unit update the display content of the user screen to the content shown in . That is the display content of the content region is changed to the album list from the photo list and the screen explanatory data is changed to the album list from the photo list too.

When the display content of the content region is to be switched the content region display control unit causes the screen for a switching source content e.g. a photo image a photo title a tag character string and profile information to slide out and at the same time causes the screen for a switching destination content to slide in. When the display content of the screen explanatory region is to be switched the operation region display control unit causes the screen explanatory data for the switching source content to slide out and at the same time causes the image explanatory data for the switching destination content to slide in.

Now assume also that a tap operation on the photo list icon located to the left of the album list icon is detected in this operation region . In this case the content region display control unit causes the content of the album list to slide out rightward in the content region so as to be hidden and at the same time causes the content of the photo list to slide in rightward from the left side of the content region . The operation region display control unit causes the screen explanatory data for the album list to slide out rightward in the screen explanatory region so as to be hidden and at the same time causes the explanatory data for the photo list to slide in rightward from the left side of the screen explanatory region .

Assume on the other hand that a tap operation on the favorite icon located to the right of the album list icon is detected in this operation region . In this case the content region display control unit causes the content of the album list to slide out leftward in the content region so as to be hidden and at the same time causes the content of the favorites to slide in leftward from the right side of the content region . The operation region display control unit causes the screen explanatory data for the album list to slide out leftward in the screen explanatory region so as to be hidden and at the same time causes the explanatory data for the favorites to slide in leftward from the right side of the screen explanatory region .

As described above the display content of the user screen is updated according to the positional relationships between a previously selected icon and a newly selected icon. Thus it is easy for the user to intuitively grasp whether selected is an icon located to the left or to the right of the previously selected icon. Also even when there are many content specifying icons arranged in the operation region it is easy for the user to intuitively grasp the position of each icon.

The pop up display control unit displays the selected icon explanatory data the left hand icon explanatory data the right hand icon explanatory data and the emphasis region in such a manner that they are superposed over a content of the content region . Hereinafter the selected icon explanatory data the left hand icon explanatory data the right hand icon explanatory data and the emphasis region will be generically referred to as operation guide also. The pop up display control unit displays the selected icon explanatory data in a manner such that the selected icon explanatory data is larger than the content specifying icon in size. Since the size of the content region is larger than that of the operation region displaying the operation guide in the content region can enhance the visibility of the caption for the selected icon.

The pop up display control unit displays the operation guide while the display content of the content region and the display content of the screen explanatory region are being updated. shows a case where the user screen of the photo list is changed to the user screen of the album list. The pop up display control unit displays the operation guide for a time duration T required for the photo image and the photo title to slide out and for the album image and the album title to slide in or for less than T. In other words as soon as the content region display control unit and the operation region display control unit terminate the updating of the user screen the pop up display control unit hides the operation guide.

In a modification the pop up display control unit may display the operation guide for a predetermined time duration. In another modification when the passage of a certain time equal to or less than the predetermined time duration is detected the permeability of the operation guide may be gradually increased and then the operation guide may be completely hidden when the predetermined time duration has elapsed.

A description is now given of a processing performed when a long touch operation on a content specifying icon is detected or when a trace operation over the other content specifying icons is detected after the touch operation on a specific content specifying icon has been detected.

During a long touch operation on the content specifying icon and a trace operation thereon the content region display control unit suppresses the updating of content in the content region . In other words the content region display control unit maintains the display content before the long touch operation and the trace operation. And when a release operation is detected after the long touch operation or trace operation it is determined that the content specifying icon located in the position where the release operation took place has been selected and therefore the display content of the content region is updated.

Similarly during a long touch operation on the content specifying icon and a trace operation thereon the operation region display control unit withholds the screen explanatory data in the screen explanatory region . In other words the operation region display control unit maintains the screen explanatory data displayed before the long touch operation and the trace operation. And when a release operation is detected after the long touch operation or trace operation it is determined that the content specifying icon in the position where the release operation took place has been selected and therefore the screen explanatory data in the screen explanatory region is updated.

That is the content region display control unit and the operation region display control unit update the user screen in the same way upon detection of a tap operation and a long touch operation plus a release operation respectively.

When on the other hand a touch operation on any of the content specifying icons is detected the pop up display control unit displays the display guide for an icon associated with the position where the touch operation took place no matter whether the operation is a tap operation or a long touch operation namely irrespective of the timing of the release operation. When a trace operation over a plurality of content specifying icons is detected the pop up display control unit sequentially switches the information on icons selected sequentially by the trace operation and displays the thus switched icon information in the emphasis region as the selected icon explanatory data . In this manner the operation that switches the display content on the screen by selecting an icon and the operation that causes the caption for the icon selected are combined together in the mobile game device . In other words both the screen display content switching operation and the operation causing the caption for the selected icon are realized using the same user interface.

With the tag list icon selected as a result of a trace operation leftward from the favorite icon on the user screen of the pop up display control unit updates the operation guide to display the selected icon explanatory data in the emphasis region for the newly selected tag list icon . On the other hand the content region display control unit and the operation region display control unit maintain the display contents before the trace operation that is .

With the switching of selected icons during a trace operation the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the icon whose selection has been canceled hereinafter referred to as previously selected icon also to slide out of the emphasis region . At the same time the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the icon which has been newly selected hereinafter referred to as newly selected icon also to slide into the emphasis region thus displaying it as the selected icon explanatory data .

More specifically when a newly selected icon is located to the immediate left of a previously selected icon in the operation region that is when selected icons are switched by a leftward trace operation the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the previously selected icon to slide rightward out of the emphasis region to be displayed as right hand icon explanatory data . At the same time the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the newly selected icon which has been displayed as the left hand icon explanatory data to slide from the left side into the emphasis region to be displayed as the selected icon explanatory data .

For example in if a trace operation is done from the favorite icon to the tag list icon the caption for the favorite icon will slide rightward out of the emphasis region to become the right hand icon explanatory data . At the same time the caption for the tag list icon will slide rightward into the emphasis region . At this time the caption for the album list icon will slide in from the left side of the user screen to be newly displayed as the left hand icon explanatory data . A similar processing will follow a trace operation from the tag list icon to the album list icon thereby causing a display of .

Also when a newly selected icon is located to the immediate right of a previously selected icon in the operation region that is when selected icons are switched by a rightward trace operation the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the previously selected icon to slide leftward out of the emphasis region to be displayed as left hand icon explanatory data . At the same time the pop up display control unit causes the caption for the newly selected icon which has been displayed as the right hand icon explanatory data to slide from the right side into the emphasis region to be displayed as the selected icon explanatory data .

In this manner a caption for a sequentially selected icon by a leftward trace operation is slid sequentially rightward into the emphasis region thus updating the operation guide. Also a caption for a sequentially selected icon by a rightward trace operation is slid sequentially leftward into the emphasis region thus updating the operation guide. As a result even when there are many content specifying icons arranged in the operation region it is easy for the user to intuitively grasp the positional relationships between the icons.

It should be noted that the pop up display control unit updates the operation guide at a speed corresponding to the speed of trace operation on the content specifying icons . In other words the faster the speed of tracing over the content specifying icons that is the quicker the switching of the selected icons the higher the speed the pop up display control unit will set for the slide in and slide out of the captions for the icons.

If a release operation from the album list icon on the user screen of is detected the user screen of an album list as shown in will be displayed. More specifically the content region display control unit will cause the content of user profile to slide out rightward and at the same time the content of album list to slide in rightward from the left side of the content region . Also the operation region display control unit will cause the screen explanatory data for profile to slide out rightward and at the same time the screen explanatory data for album list to slide in rightward from the left side of the screen explanatory region . Upon completion of the updating of the user screen associated with the release operation the pop up display control unit terminates the display of the operation guide.

Though partially described above there are cases where the photo viewing application displays many kinds of contents and a great number of content specifying icons are simultaneously displayed on the display device of the mobile game device . As already mentioned the operation region is smaller than the content region in size. Thus if a large number of content specifying icons are to be arranged in the operation region the size of each of those icons must be set to a smaller size. This may make it difficult to select an appropriate icon with which to display a content desired by the user.

When a content specifying icon is pressed with a long touch in the mobile game device according to the present embodiment it is not determined that the content specifying icon is actually selected unless the finger is completely released from the content specifying icon . Thus while checking the icon displayed in the operation guide the user can trace over a plurality of content specifying icons and select a desired content specifying icon . This can support the user in appropriately selecting a desired icon even though many content specifying icons are arranged in the operation region thereby suppressing drop in operability of the user screen .

If the display contents of the content region and the screen explanatory region are updated every time the selected icons are switched by the trace operation the display contents may be changed frequently and some unintended contents may be acquired. This may have the adverse effect of reducing the user s convenience. In the present embodiment changing the display contents of the content region and the screen explanatory region is withheld and the operation guide only is updated until any of the content specifying icon is finally and determinably selected by the release operation after the trace operation. This can prevent the user s convenience from being decreased.

A detailed description will now be given of a structure of the photo information screen display control unit by referring to and . and each illustrates a photo information screen . When a user s tap operation on a specific photo image is detected on the home screen or the list screen the photo information screen display control unit displays the photo information screen for the photo image that has been tapped.

More specifically the photo information screen display control unit displays a photo image acquired by the content acquiring unit in a content region . Also the photo information screen display control unit displays text data associated with the photo image in an attribute region . The attribute region includes a home icon with which to allow the screen to return to the menu list screen an edit icon used to edit the comments or tags a basic information area that displays the name of a person who has submitted the photo image the number of accesses and the like a photo describing area where a caption for the photo written by the contributor is displayed and a detailed information button with which to display the detailed information concerning the photo image.

When a tap operation on the detailed information button is detected on the photo information screen the photo information screen display control unit displays the photo information screen of . On the photo information screen of the number of users who have registered the photo image in their favorites a tag character string set for the photo image and a comment therefor by each user and a return button are displayed in the detailed information area . The photo information screen display control unit displays the detailed information area in such a manner that the detailed information area is superposed on the attribute region . When a tap operation on the return button is detected on the photo information screen the photo information screen display control unit displays the photo information screen again.

When a tap operation on the edit icon is detected on the photo information screen the information input supporting unit displays an input area for entering a tag and comment and a screen software keyboard in such a manner that the input area and the software keyboard are superposed on the attribute region . When a tap operation on a not shown posting button is detected on the photo information screen the posting processing unit uploads the data for the comment and tag inputted into the input area to the photo sharing server and registered them thereon.

As described above the area presenting the basic information the area presenting the detailed information on the photo image and the information input area for the photo image are each switched to a region different from the content region on the photo information screen and displayed thereon. This allows to present the information on the photo image and support the entry of information even in the mobile information device where the size of the display device is subject to limitation without interfering with the viewing of the photo image by the user

An operation implementing the above described structure is as follows. As a photo viewing application is started in the mobile game device the content acquiring unit acquires photos which are to be displayed in the respective category areas in the menu list screen . Then the home screen display control unit displays the menu list screen including a plurality of category areas . When the open icon is tapped in any one of the category areas the home screen display control unit displays the individual menu screen of a category associated with the tapped icon.

As the a photo list icon is tapped on the menu list screen or the individual menu screen the content acquiring unit acquires a user s photo list from the photo sharing server . The user screen display control unit displays the user screen whose content is the photo list. When a tap operation on a specific content specifying icon is detected on the user screen the user screen display control unit switches the display content of the user screen to the content associated with the tapped icon.

When a trace operation over a plurality of content specifying icons is detected on the user screen the user screen display control unit sequentially switches the information on a selected icon in the operation guide while maintaining the display contents of the content region and the operation region on the user screen without changing the display contents thereof. When a release operation is detected after the trace operation the user screen display control unit switches the display contents of the content region and the operation region to the content associated with an icon located in the position where the release operation took place.

When a tap operation on a specific photo image is detected on the home screen or the list screen the photo information screen display control unit displays the photo information screen in such a manner that the photo image tapped and the basic information concerning the photo are arranged side by side. As detailed information is required in the photo information screen the photo information screen display control unit displays the detailed information in such a manner that the detailed information is superposed on the basic information concerning the photo. When a photo image is tapped on the photo information screen the full screen display control unit displays one photo image which has been tapped full screen on the display device .

The present invention has been described based upon illustrative exemplary embodiments. The above described exemplary embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications to the combination of constituting elements and processes could be developed and that such modifications are also within the scope of the present invention. Some examples of such modifications are described below.

For example when a trace operation on a content specifying icon is detected the release of the user s finger from the touch panel indicates the end of the trace operation and is detected accordingly in the above described embodiments. In a modification however the end of the trace operation may be detected when a predetermined operation different from the operation so far is done. For example if a touch operation i.e. long touch operation in this case that continues for a predetermined time e.g. 1 second or the like or longer is detected on an icon located in the position where the trace operation ends this touch operation may be detected as the termination of the trace operation. Also if a slide operation toward a direction different from the direction where the icons are arranged e.g. a downward slide operation is detected on an icon located in the position where the trace operation ends this operation may be detected as the termination of the trace operation.

Though not mentioned in the above embodiments the pop up display control unit may display at least part of the operation guide half translucently. For example the icon explanatory screen is set to have a predetermined permeability using a known image processing technique such as alpha blending. Note that an object which is to be displayed half translucently may be the emphasis region only. Note also that the object to be displayed half translucently may be the left hand icon explanatory data and the right hand icon explanatory data only.

In the above described embodiments in addition to the selected icon explanatory data the pop up display control unit displays the left hand icon explanatory data and the right hand icon explanatory data as the operation guide. In a modification the pop up display control unit displays the selected icon explanatory data only as the operation guide. In this case the pop up display control unit may cause a caption for a sequentially selected icon by a trace operation is slid sequentially into the emphasis region from either side of the user screen in a sliding direction corresponding to the tracing direction. Similarly a caption for an icon whose selection has been canceled by a trace operation is slid sequentially out of the emphasis region of the user screen so as to be off screen in a sliding direction corresponding to the tracing direction.

In the above described embodiments when a touch operation on a content specifying icon is detected the pop up display control unit displays an operation guide including the selected icon explanatory data . In a modification if a touch operation i.e. long touch operation in this case on an icon which continues for a predetermined time e.g. 2 seconds or longer is detected a further detailed caption for this icon may be obtained from the icon information storage unit and display the further detailed caption near the selected icon explanatory data .

In the above described embodiments the touch panel detects contact by a finger of the user and the operation detector detects an operation by the user based on the detected contact. In a modification if a finger of the user is not in contact with the touch panel but it is detected by the touch panel that the finger thereof is located in close proximity to the touch panel namely within a predetermined distance the touch panel may send information indicating the operation by the user to the operation detector and then the operation detector may detect the touch operation by the user according to the information. Also if it is detected by the touch panel that the position of the finger changes from within the predetermined distance to the predetermined distance or above the touch panel may send the information to the operation detector and then the operation detector may detect the release operation by the user according to the information.

Further the touch panel may be operated by a medium other than the finger of the user. Such a medium may be a stylus pen for instance.

Further in above described embodiments the display contents of the content region the screen explanatory region and the emphasis region of the user screen are switched by combining the slide out of a switching source content and the slide in of a switching destination content. In a modification the display contents thereof may be switched by either the slide out of a switching source content or the slide in of a switching destination content.

For example if the display contents thereof are to be switched by the slide out thereof only a display of switching source data may be switched to a display of switching destination data in such manner that the switching destination data is set behind the switching source data namely it is set as a background and then the switching source data is slid out. In other words the display content on the screen may be updated in such a manner that the switching source data overlapped onto the switching destination data is removed gradually. If the display contents thereof are to be switched by the slide in thereof only a display of switching source data may be switched to a display of switching destination data in such manner that the switching destination data is slid in and overlapped onto the switching source data. In other words the display content on the screen may be updated in such a manner that the switching destination data is gradually overlapped onto the switching source data.

Further in above described embodiments in the content region and the screen explanatory region the switching source data corresponding to a previously selected icon is slid out and the switching destination data corresponding to a newly selected icon is slid in. In a modification when the display contents of the content region and the screen explanatory region are to be updated data corresponding to at least one icon called specific icon here located between the previously selected icon and the newly selected icon in the operation region are scrolled and displayed together with an electronic content associated with the specific icon and a caption for the specific icon. In other words the switching source data corresponding to the previously selected icon the data corresponding to the specific icon the switching destination data corresponding to the newly selected icon are sequentially switched and displayed. For example the switching source data associated with the previously selected icon is slid out and the data associated with the specific icon is slid in. Then the data associated with the specific icon is slid out and the switching destination data associated with the newly selected icon is slid in.

Similar operation is applicable to displaying the operation guide when a tap operation on a content specifying icon is done. For example when a tap operation on a content specifying icon is detected the pop up display control unit may sequentially switch the caption for the previously selected icon the caption for the specific icon and the caption for the newly selected icon in the emphasis region and display them therein. For example after the caption for the previously selected icon has been displayed in the emphasis region the caption for the previously selected icon may be slid out and the caption for the specific icon may be slid in. Then the caption for the specific icon may be slid out and the caption for the newly selected icon may be slid in. Finally the caption for the newly selected icon may be displayed in the emphasis region for a certain length of time.

Further in the above described embodiments a description is given of an example where the photo images and the titles of the photo images are acquired from the photo sharing site and displayed. In a modification comments attached to the photo images may be acquired in substitution for or in addition to the titles thereof.
