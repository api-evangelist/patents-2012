This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 446 998 entitled MICROBIAL PRODUCTION OF 3 4 DIHYDROXYBUTYRATE DHBA AND 3 HYDROXYBUTYROLACTONE 3 HBL filed on Feb. 25 2011 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. EEC0540879 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention relates to the production of 3 4 dihydroxybutyrate 2 3 dihydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxybutyrolactone through recombinant gene expression.

3 4 dihydroxybutyrate 3 4 DHBA 2 3 dihydroxybutyrate 2 3 DHBA and 3 hydroxybutyrolactone 3 HBL are highly useful chiral intermediates that can be used to synthesize statin class drugs like CRESTOR and LIPITOR carnitine and other fine chemicals. The annual market for statin drugs was estimated to be 10 15 billion in 2003 and 2004 while the annual demand for carnitine which is used as a vitamin supplement is estimated to be several hundred metric tons. 3 4 DHBA and 3 HBL can also be readily derivatized into valuable compounds like carnitine which has an approximate 5 per gram cost and is used as a vitamin and nutritional supplement.

Currently DHBA is not commercially available while 3 HBL costs 30 100 per gram. The high cost and low availability of these compounds increases the costs of statin drugs. Existing methods for the synthesis of DHBA and 3 HBL rely on crude harsh chemical synthetic means such as the harsh reduction of malic acid or the breakdown of various hexose sugars with acid. Such chemical synthetic methods produce several byproducts necessitating the extensive purification of the DHBA or 3 HBL product.

Described herein are efficient biological methods for producing 3 4 dihydroxybutyrate 3 4 DHBA 2 3 dihydroxybutyrate 2 3 DHBA and 3 hydroxybutyrolactone 3 HBL in cells such as cells. Methods involve integration of pathways for glycolate synthesis with pathways for synthesis of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL leading to efficient and cost effective production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL from simple fermentable sugars as a sole feedstock.

These and other aspects of the invention as well as various embodiments thereof will become more apparent in reference to the drawings and detailed description of the invention. Each of the limitations of the invention can encompass various embodiments of the invention. It is therefore anticipated that each of the limitations of the invention involving any one element or combinations of elements can be included in each aspect of the invention.

Existing chemical synthesis routes for production of 3 HBL and DHBA employ harsh conditions expensive materials and entail extensive post synthesis separations making the synthesis of these valuable chiral building blocks economically unattractive. Described herein is the first demonstration of direct synthesis of DHBA and 3 HBL from a simple fermentable sugar as a sole feedstock. Cells associated with the invention are engineered to contain integrated pathways for glycolate synthesis and for 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis circumventing the need for glycolate to be supplied as an additional feedstock for cellular production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL. Integration of these cellular pathways substantially improves the efficiency and cost effectiveness of production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL allowing for their synthesis from simple and inexpensive sugar feedstocks such as those derived from biomass.

This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of including comprising or having containing involving and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

Methods described herein involve integration of two cellular pathways a first pathway for production of glycolate and a second pathway that uses glycolate for the synthesis of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL. Significantly since both of these pathways are integrated within the same cell the need for externally supplied glycolate is obviated allowing for production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL from simple fermentable sugars as a sole feedstock.

Aspects of the invention relate to increasing glycolate production within a cell. As shown in glycolate can be synthesized from glucose in a cell such as an cell. Increased production of glycolate from glucose in a cell can be achieved through manipulation of the endogenous glyoxylate shunt as shown in . Enzymes such as Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase phosphatase AceK Isocitrate lyase AceA and Glyoxylate reductase YcdW promote glycolate synthesis while enzymes such as Idh phosphatase and Malate synthase AceB GlcB are detrimental to glycolate synthesis.

The expression and or activity of one or more of the enzymes involved in synthesizing glycolate from glucose can be altered for achieving increased production of glycolate. For example expression and or activity of one or more of AceK AceA and YcdW can be increased to enhance glycolate synthesis. In some embodiments aceK aceA and or ycdW are expressed endogenously in the cell while in other embodiments aceK aceA and or ycdW are not expressed endogenously in the cell. Increased expression and or activity of endogenous aceK aceA and or ycdW can be achieved by manipulation of one or more of the aceK aceA and ycdW genes their promoters and or their ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments all or part of the endogenous promoter of aceK aceA and or ycdW is replaced with an inducible promoter or a constitutively active promoter. Regardless of whether aceK aceA and ycdW are expressed endogenously in the cell or not one or more copies of aceK aceA and or ycdW can be expressed in the cell either on one or more plasmids or through integration into the chromosome.

In some embodiments ycdW aceA and aceK are expressed together on an inducible plasmid such as pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK which is inducible using IPTG or pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK which is inducible using tetracycline or anhydro tetracycline aTc . As shown in the Examples an K 12 strain transformed with pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK or pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK synthesized up to approximately 1.5 g L of glycolate when cultured in minimal medium supplemented with glucose. As one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate many different types of inducible plasmids are compatible with aspects of the invention.

The expression and or activity of one or more enzymes that are detrimental to production of glycolate from glucose can also be altered for achieving increased production of glycolate. In some embodiments expression and or activity of one or more of iclR encoding a repressor of the aceBAK operon gcl encoding a Glyoxylate caroligase and aceB encoding a Malate synthase is reduced or eliminated relative to the expression or activity of these genes in a wild type cell. It should be appreciated that the expression or activity of a gene such as iclR gcl and or aceB can be reduced or eliminated using any means known in the art. In some embodiments iclR gcl and aceB are each knocked out in the cell. In other embodiments iclR gcl and or aceB can contain one or more mutations such as point mutations or deletions. In some embodiments the expression or activity of one or more of glcD glcE glcF aldA eddA and eda is also reduced or eliminated in the cell relative to a wild type cell. presents a schematic showing non limiting examples of genes that can be knocked out in order attenuate glycolate consumption in a cell and increase glycolate production in the cell.

In some embodiments a cell overexpresses one or more of ycdW aceA and aceK and has reduced or eliminated expression of one or more of iclR gcl and aceB relative to a wild type cell. In certain embodiments ycdW aceA and aceK are each overexpressed and iclR gcl and aceB are each knocked out in the cell.

Methods for attenuating glycolate consumption and increasing glycolate production in a cell are disclosed in and incorporated by reference from US Patent Publication US 2009 0155867 Soucaille . In US 2009 0155867 overexpression of YcdW was used to increase production of glycolate. However nine different gene knockouts were required in order to achieve comparable glycolate titers to those that are demonstrated in the Examples of the instant application through overexpression of YcdW AceA and AceK combined with knockouts of only three genes iclR gcl and aceB. Without wishing to be bound by any theory co overexpression of YcdW AceA and AceK may allow a cell to achieve high glycolate titers without having to knock out multiple genes. A strain with fewer gene knockouts is likely to be healthier than one with many gene knockouts especially for growth on minimal medium since it has many of the anaplerotic pathways intact representing an advantage of the strains described herein over those described in US 2009 0155867.

It should also be appreciated that unlike in US 2009 0155867 where the goal of the engineered strains was to produce as much glycolate as possible from a cell in methods described herein glycolate production is integrated with pathways for production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL discussed further below. Thus the goal was to construct strains capable of sustained glycolate synthesis rather than maximum glycolate synthesis. Optimization of glycolate production can involve an assessment of levels of production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL. In some embodiments an optimal level of glycolate production is that level which permits optimal production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL.

Since acetyl CoA is a common intermediate for both glycolate and DHBA synthesis its distribution along the two pathways can be optimized. A strain engineered for maximum glycolate synthesis such as those described in US 2009 0155867 may not be optimal for 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis. Too many knocked out genes can result in excessive diversion of acetyl CoA towards glycolate synthesis leaving little for 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA or 3 HBL synthesis. Additionally too many gene knockouts can also result in an unhealthy cell which may not be capable of expressing the recombinant genes discussed below for synthesis of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL.

While cells associated with the invention can be grown in a range of different media conditions including minimal and rich media growth in minimal medium is beneficial for functioning of the glyoxylate shunt. However as demonstrated in the Examples co expression of all of different enzymes for glycolate synthesis and synthesis of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL during growth in minimal medium imposes considerable metabolic burden on cells which can hamper effective expression of one or more enzymes. Thus simple cloning of each gene into a plasmid and attempting to express them in the strains discussed in US 2009 0155867 would not have achieved direct synthesis of DHBA or 3 HBL from glucose. As demonstrated in the Examples after extensive efforts to overcome the effects of metabolic burden in cells one effective strategy that was uncovered for dealing with metabolic burden was to distribute the different pathway enzymes between two or more different inducible expression systems. Unexpectedly this distributed expression substantially increased production of DHBA and 3 HBL. As used herein distributed expression refers to expressing two or more genes in a cell using two or more different inducible expression systems. In some embodiments if a gene is endogenously expressed its expression can be induced by replacing its promoter with an inducible or constitutively active promoter.

A biosynthetic pathway for production of 3 hydroxyacids such as DHBA and 3 HBL was demonstrated in and is incorporated by reference from WO 2010 101651 Martin et al. . In the biosynthetic pathway described in WO 2010 101651 also referred to herein as the 3 hydroxyalkanoic acid pathway glycolate was added to the cells as a feedstock in the medium for synthesis of DHBA and 3 HBL.

By contrast cells described herein are genetically engineered to produce glycolate which can feed into the DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis pathway obviating the need to supply glycolate as an additional feedstock. This integrated approach significantly improves the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the biosynthetic production of these valuable chiral building blocks.

Methods and compositions described herein use the 3 hydroxyalkanoic acid pathway to synthesize 3 hydroxyacids such as 3 hydroxybutyrolactone 3 HBL and or its hydrolyzed form 3 4 dihydroxybutyric acid 3 4 DHBA and 2 3 dihydroxybutyric acid 2 3 DHBA from sugars and sugar derived substrates. As used herein a hydroxyacid refers to a compound that contains both a carboxyl and a hydroxyl moiety. As used herein DHBA refers to 3 4 dihydroxybutyric acid 3 4 DHBA and or 2 3 dihydroxybutyric acid 2 3 DHBA .

Short chain acyl CoA compounds that would be candidate substrates for this pathway are not readily available metabolites in . To circumvent this propionyl CoA transferase pct an enzyme with broad substrate specificity is used to exchange CoA moieties between short chain organic acids. In methods and compositions described herein pct is used to transfer CoA from acetyl CoA to a substrate such as an acid supplied to the cell forming the acyl CoA for use by the pathway. In some embodiments a phosphotransbutyrase ptb gene and a butyrokinase buk gene are used to produce propionyl CoA instead of pct.

Aspects of the invention relate to recombinant expression of one or more genes encoding for one or more enzymes in the 3 hydroxyalkanoic acid pathway. Enzymes associated with this pathway include thiolases encoded by thil bktB phaA or atoB and reductases phaB hbd or Sl . Aspects of the invention also relate to recombinant expression of propionyl CoA transferase encoded by pct and thioesterase B encoded by tesB .

Aspects of the invention relate to cell s that recombinantly express one or more genes associated with the invention and the use of such cells in producing glycolate 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL. In some embodiments the cell is cultured in minimal medium supplemented with glucose or glycerol as the only carbon and energy source during which time glycolate 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL are produced and excreted into the culture medium. 3 HB is also synthesized as a by product. Growth in minimal medium ensures appreciable flux through the glyoxylate shunt which is heavily repressed during growth in rich medium for effective glycolate synthesis. Further acetyl CoA is a common metabolic intermediate in both. In minimal medium the accumulation of acetate formed from acetyl CoA due to excess glycolytic flux stimulates flux through the glyoxylate shunt. High acetyl CoA levels maintain a high flux through the glyoxylate shunt for glycolate synthesis ensuring efficient activation of glycolate to glycolyl CoA since Pct transfers CoA from acetyl CoA to glycolate in the activation step in the DHBA and 3 HBL pathway and condensation of glycolyl CoA with acetyl CoA by BktB. High acetyl CoA levels can also result in loss of carbon in the form of by products such as acetate and 3 HB. Thus as discussed further herein in the integrated pathway one of the mechanisms for optimizing the intracellular acetyl CoA levels is to vary the feed glucose concentration to achieve selective DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis.

Further aspects of the invention relate to methods for producing 2 3 DHBA in the presence of glycolate using cells that may or may not be engineered to modulate glycolate synthesis. For example methods include use of cells that recombinantly express a pct gene at least one of a phaA thil atoB or bktB gene and at least one of a phaB or hbd gene for the production of 2 3 DHBA.

Using the integrated pathway described herein titers of up to 1.36 g L for DHBA and 0.13 g L for 3 HBL in the strain MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB expressing the glycolate pathway genes ycdW aceA and aceK and DHBA and 3 HBL pathway genes bktB phaB pct and tesB grown in minimal medium supplemented with 1.5 wt vol glucose at the shake flask scale after 90 hours of fermentation at 30 C. As discussed further herein expression of pathway enzymes was distributed between two separately inducible expression systems.

It should be appreciated that the genes associated with the invention can be obtained from a variety of sources. In some embodiments the phaA phaB and bktB genes are obtained from a strain of such as H16 the tesB gene is obtained from a strain of such as K12 the pct gene is obtained from a strain of such as BE2 2083 the atoB gene is obtained from a strain of such as KT2440 the hbd and thil genes are obtained from a strain of such as 824 and the SI gene is obtained from a strain of . In some embodiments the ycdW aceA and aceK genes are genes such as K 12 genes. In some embodiments wherein ptb and buk are expressed instead of pct the ptb and buk genes are coexpressed on an operon. In some embodiments the ptb buk operon is obtained from a strain of

It should be appreciated that any of the nucleic acids and or polypeptides described herein can be codon optimized and expressed recombinantly in a codon optimized form.

As one of ordinary skill in the art would be aware homologous genes for these enzymes could be obtained from other species and could be identified by homology searches for example through a protein BLAST search available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI internet site ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Genes associated with the invention can be PCR amplified from DNA from any source of DNA which contains the given gene. In some embodiments genes associated with the invention are synthetic. Any means of obtaining a gene encoding the enzymes associated with the invention are compatible with the instant invention.

The invention thus involves recombinant expression of genes encoding enzymes discussed above functional modifications and variants of the foregoing as well as uses relating thereto. Homologs and alleles of the nucleic acids associated with the invention can be identified by conventional techniques. Also encompassed by the invention are nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions to the nucleic acids described herein. The term stringent conditions as used herein refers to parameters with which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in references which compile such methods e.g. J. Sambrook et al. eds. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 or F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. More specifically stringent conditions as used herein refers for example to hybridization at 65 C. in hybridization buffer 3.5 SSC 0.02 Ficoll 0.02 polyvinyl pyrrolidone 0.02 Bovine Serum Albumin 2.5 mM NaHPO pH7 0.5 SDS 2 mM EDTA . SSC is 0.15M sodium chloride 0.015M sodium citrate pH7 SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate and EDTA is ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization the membrane upon which the DNA is transferred is washed for example in 2 SSC at room temperature and then at 0.1 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS at temperatures up to 68 C.

There are other conditions reagents and so forth which can be used which result in a similar degree of stringency. The skilled artisan will be familiar with such conditions and thus they are not given here. It will be understood however that the skilled artisan will be able to manipulate the conditions in a manner to permit the clear identification of homologs and alleles of nucleic acids of the invention e.g. by using lower stringency conditions . The skilled artisan also is familiar with the methodology for screening cells and libraries for expression of such molecules which then are routinely isolated followed by isolation of the pertinent nucleic acid molecule and sequencing.

In general homologs and alleles typically will share at least 75 nucleotide identity and or at least 80 amino acid identity to the sequences of nucleic acids and polypeptides respectively in some instances will share at least 90 nucleotide identity and or at least 90 or 95 amino acid identity and in still other instances will share at least 95 nucleotide identity and or at least 99 amino acid identity. In some embodiments homologs and alleles will share at least 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 nucleotide identity to the sequences of nucleic acids and or 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity to the sequences of polypeptides.

The homology can be calculated using various publicly available software tools developed by NCBI Bethesda Md. that can be obtained through the NCBI internet site. Exemplary tools include the BLAST software also available at the NCBI internet site www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Pairwise and ClustalW alignments BLOSUM30 matrix setting as well as Kyte Doolittle hydropathic analysis can be obtained using the MacVector sequence analysis software Oxford Molecular Group . Watson Crick complements of the foregoing nucleic acids also are embraced by the invention.

The invention also includes degenerate nucleic acids which include alternative codons to those present in the native materials. For example serine residues are encoded by the codons TCA AGT TCC TCG TCT and AGC. Each of the six codons is equivalent for the purposes of encoding a serine residue. Thus it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of the serine encoding nucleotide triplets may be employed to direct the protein synthesis apparatus in vitro or in vivo to incorporate a serine residue into an elongating polypeptide. Similarly nucleotide sequence triplets which encode other amino acid residues include but are not limited to CCA CCC CCG and CCT proline codons CGA CGC CGG CGT AGA and AGG arginine codons ACA ACC ACG and ACT threonine codons AAC and AAT asparagine codons and ATA ATC and ATT isoleucine codons . Other amino acid residues may be encoded similarly by multiple nucleotide sequences. Thus the invention embraces degenerate nucleic acids that differ from the biologically isolated nucleic acids in codon sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. The invention also embraces codon optimization to suit optimal codon usage of a host cell.

The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules which include additions substitutions and deletions of one or more nucleotides. In preferred embodiments these modified nucleic acid molecules and or the polypeptides they encode retain at least one activity or function of the unmodified nucleic acid molecule and or the polypeptides such as enzymatic activity. In certain embodiments the modified nucleic acid molecules encode modified polypeptides preferably polypeptides having conservative amino acid substitutions as are described elsewhere herein. The modified nucleic acid molecules are structurally related to the unmodified nucleic acid molecules and in preferred embodiments are sufficiently structurally related to the unmodified nucleic acid molecules so that the modified and unmodified nucleic acid molecules hybridize under stringent conditions known to one of skill in the art.

For example modified nucleic acid molecules which encode polypeptides having single amino acid changes can be prepared. Each of these nucleic acid molecules can have one two or three nucleotide substitutions exclusive of nucleotide changes corresponding to the degeneracy of the genetic code as described herein. Likewise modified nucleic acid molecules which encode polypeptides having two amino acid changes can be prepared which have e.g. 2 6 nucleotide changes. Numerous modified nucleic acid molecules like these will be readily envisioned by one of skill in the art including for example substitutions of nucleotides in codons encoding amino acids 2 and 3 2 and 4 2 and 5 2 and 6 and so on. In the foregoing example each combination of two amino acids is included in the set of modified nucleic acid molecules as well as all nucleotide substitutions which code for the amino acid substitutions. Additional nucleic acid molecules that encode polypeptides having additional substitutions i.e. 3 or more additions or deletions e.g. by introduction of a stop codon or a splice site s also can be prepared and are embraced by the invention as readily envisioned by one of ordinary skill in the art. Any of the foregoing nucleic acids or polypeptides can be tested by routine experimentation for retention of structural relation or activity to the nucleic acids and or polypeptides disclosed herein.

The invention embraces variants of polypeptides. As used herein a variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide which contains one or more modifications to the primary amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. Modifications which create a variant can be made to a polypeptide 1 to reduce or eliminate an activity of a polypeptide 2 to enhance a property of a polypeptide 3 to provide a novel activity or property to a polypeptide such as addition of an antigenic epitope or addition of a detectable moiety or 4 to provide equivalent or better binding between molecules e.g. an enzymatic substrate . Modifications to a polypeptide are typically made to the nucleic acid which encodes the polypeptide and can include deletions point mutations truncations amino acid substitutions and additions of amino acids or non amino acid moieties. Alternatively modifications can be made directly to the polypeptide such as by cleavage addition of a linker molecule addition of a detectable moiety such as biotin addition of a fatty acid and the like. Modifications also embrace fusion proteins comprising all or part of the amino acid sequence. One of skill in the art will be familiar with methods for predicting the effect on protein conformation of a change in protein sequence and can thus design a variant of a polypeptide according to known methods. One example of such a method is described by Dahiyat and Mayo in 278 82 87 1997 whereby proteins can be designed de novo. The method can be applied to a known protein to vary a only a portion of the polypeptide sequence. By applying the computational methods of Dahiyat and Mayo specific variants of a polypeptide can be proposed and tested to determine whether the variant retains a desired conformation.

In general variants include polypeptides which are modified specifically to alter a feature of the polypeptide unrelated to its desired physiological activity. For example cysteine residues can be substituted or deleted to prevent unwanted disulfide linkages. Similarly certain amino acids can be changed to enhance expression of a polypeptide by eliminating proteolysis by proteases in an expression system e.g. dibasic amino acid residues in yeast expression systems in which KEX2 protease activity is present .

Mutations of a nucleic acid which encode a polypeptide preferably preserve the amino acid reading frame of the coding sequence and preferably do not create regions in the nucleic acid which are likely to hybridize to form secondary structures such a hairpins or loops which can be deleterious to expression of the variant polypeptide.

Mutations can be made by selecting an amino acid substitution or by random mutagenesis of a selected site in a nucleic acid which encodes the polypeptide. Variant polypeptides are then expressed and tested for one or more activities to determine which mutation provides a variant polypeptide with the desired properties. Further mutations can be made to variants or to non variant polypeptides which are silent as to the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide but which provide preferred codons for translation in a particular host. The preferred codons for translation of a nucleic acid in e.g. are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Still other mutations can be made to the noncoding sequences of a gene or cDNA clone to enhance expression of the polypeptide. The activity of variant polypeptides can be tested by cloning the gene encoding the variant polypeptide into a bacterial or mammalian expression vector introducing the vector into an appropriate host cell expressing the variant polypeptide and testing for a functional capability of the polypeptides as disclosed herein.

The skilled artisan will also realize that conservative amino acid substitutions may be made in polypeptides to provide functionally equivalent variants of the foregoing polypeptides i.e. the variants retain the functional capabilities of the polypeptides. As used herein a conservative amino acid substitution refers to an amino acid substitution which does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics of the protein in which the amino acid substitution is made. Variants can be prepared according to methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as are found in references which compile such methods e.g. J. Sambrook et al. eds. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 or F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. Exemplary functionally equivalent variants of polypeptides include conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequences of proteins disclosed herein. Conservative substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made amongst amino acids within the following groups a M I L V b F Y W c K R H d A G e S T f Q N and g E D.

In general it is preferred that fewer than all of the amino acids are changed when preparing variant polypeptides. Where particular amino acid residues are known to confer function such amino acids will not be replaced or alternatively will be replaced by conservative amino acid substitutions. Preferably 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 residues can be changed when preparing variant polypeptides. It is generally preferred that the fewest number of substitutions is made. Thus one method for generating variant polypeptides is to substitute all other amino acids for a particular single amino acid then assay activity of the variant then repeat the process with one or more of the polypeptides having the best activity.

Conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide to produce functionally equivalent variants of the polypeptide typically are made by alteration of a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Such substitutions can be made by a variety of methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example amino acid substitutions may be made by PCR directed mutation site directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel Kunkel 82 488 492 1985 or by chemical synthesis of a gene encoding a polypeptide.

The invention encompasses any type of cell that recombinantly expresses genes associated with the invention including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell such as spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. and spp. The bacterial cell can be a Gram negative cell such as an cell or a Gram positive cell such as a species of . In other embodiments the cell is a fungal cell such as yeast cells e.g. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp and industrial polyploid yeast strains.

Preferably the yeast strain is a strain. Other examples of fungi include spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. and spp. In other embodiments the cell is an algal cell a plant cell or a mammalian cell. It should be appreciated that some cells compatible with the invention may express an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention as well as a recombinant copy. In some embodiments if a cell has an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention then the methods will not necessarily require adding a recombinant copy of the gene s that are endogenously expressed. In some embodiments the cell may endogenously express one or more enzymes from the pathways described herein and may recombinantly express one or more other enzymes from the pathways described herein for efficient production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL.

In some embodiments one or more of the genes associated with the invention is expressed in a recombinant expression vector. As used herein a vector may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence or sequences may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include but are not limited to plasmids fosmids phagemids virus genomes and artificial chromosomes.

A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate autonomously or integrated in the genome in a host cell and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host cell such as a host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase.

An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include for example genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art e.g. galactosidase luciferase or alkaline phosphatase and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells hosts colonies or plaques e.g. green fluorescent protein . Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.

As used herein a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be operably joined when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5 regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not 1 result in the introduction of a frame shift mutation 2 interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences or 3 interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript can be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.

When the nucleic acid molecule that encodes any of the enzymes of the claimed invention is expressed in a cell a variety of transcription control sequences e.g. promoter enhancer sequences can be used to direct its expression. The promoter can be a native promoter i.e. the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. In some embodiments the promoter can be constitutive i.e. the promoter is unregulated allowing for continual transcription of its associated gene. A variety of conditional promoters also can be used such as promoters controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule.

The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types but shall in general include as necessary 5 non transcribed and 5 non translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively such as a TATA box capping sequence CAAT sequence and the like. In particular such 5 non transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5 leader or signal sequences. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art.

Expression vectors containing all the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989. Cells are genetically engineered by the introduction into the cells of heterologous DNA RNA . That heterologous DNA RNA is placed under operable control of transcriptional elements to permit the expression of the heterologous DNA in the host cell. Heterologous expression of genes associated with the invention for production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL is demonstrated in the Examples section using . The novel method for producing 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and 3 HBL can also be expressed in other bacterial cells archaeal cells fungi including yeast cells mammalian cells plant cells etc.

A nucleic acid molecule that encodes the enzyme of the claimed invention can be introduced into a cell or cells using methods and techniques that are standard in the art. For example nucleic acid molecules can be introduced by standard protocols such as transformation including chemical transformation and electroporation transduction particle bombardment etc. Expressing the nucleic acid molecule encoding the enzymes of the claimed invention also may be accomplished by integrating the nucleic acid molecule into the genome.

In some embodiments one or more genes associated with the invention is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell. Bacterial cells according to the invention can be cultured in media of any type rich or minimal and any composition. In some embodiments the cells are culture in minimal medium. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art routine optimization would allow for use of a variety of types of media. The selected medium can be supplemented with various additional components. Some non limiting examples of supplemental components include glucose antibiotics IPTG tetracycline or anhydro tetracycline aTc for gene induction and ATCC Trace Mineral Supplement. Similarly other aspects of the medium and growth conditions of the cells of the invention may be optimized through routine experimentation. For example pH and temperature are non limiting examples of factors which can be optimized. In some embodiments factors such as choice of media media supplements and temperature can influence production levels of 3 hydroxyacids such as 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. In some embodiments the concentration and amount of a supplemental component may be optimized. In some embodiments how often the media is supplemented with one or more supplemental components and the amount of time that the media is cultured before harvesting 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL is optimized.

Cells associated with the invention are provided with fermentable sugars as feedstocks. In some embodiments the cell is provided with one fermentable sugar as a sole feedstock. In some embodiments the fermentable sugar is glucose or glycerol. It should be appreciated that other fermentable sugars are also compatible with methods described herein. In some embodiments the fermentable sugar is derived from biomass.

In some embodiments the concentration of the fermentable sugar such as glucose or glycerol that is supplied to the culture medium is optimized. In certain embodiments the concentration of the fermentable sugar is approximately 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 or more than 3.9 . shows the variation of the DHBA glycolate and 3 HBL titers in addition to acetate and 3 HB titers for various feed glucose concentrations for the same strain cultured in minimal medium supplemented with various feed concentrations of glucose at 30 C. The yields on glucose in terms of total moles of DHBA and 3 HBL synthesized per mole of glucose supplied for various feed glucose concentrations in the same experiment are shown in Table 2. The total molar yields of the various products are observed to vary with the feed glucose concentrations with in some embodiments the highest value of total molar yield for DHBA and 3 HBL over glucose observed for a feed glucose concentration of 1 wt. vol or 10 g L.

In some embodiments the concentration of an inducer molecule is optimized. In certain embodiments the inducer is IPTG and the concentration of IPTG is approximately 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m 50 m 60 m 70 m 80 m 90 m 100 m 110 m 120 m 130 m 140 m 150 m 160 m 170 m 180 m 190 m 200 m 210 m 220 m 230 m 240 m 250 m 260 m 270 m 280 m 290 m 300 m 310 m 320 m 330 m 340 m 350 m 360 m 370 m 380 m 390 m 400 m 410 m 420 m 430 m 440 m 450 m 460 m 470 m 480 m 490 m 500 m 525 m 550 m 575 m 600 m 625 m 650 m 675 m 700 m 725 m 750 m 775 m 800 m 825 m 850 m 875 m 900 m 925 m 950 m 975 m 1000 m 1025 m 1050 m 1100 m or is more than 1100 m.

In some embodiments the inducer is tetracycline or anhydro tetracycline aTc and the concentration of tetracycline or anhydro tetracycline aTc is approximately 10 ng ml 20 ng ml 30 ng ml 40 ng ml 50 ng ml 60 ng ml 70 ng ml 80 ng ml 90 ng ml 100 ng ml 110 ng ml 120 ng ml 130 ng ml 140 ng ml 150 ng ml 160 ng ml 170 ng ml 180 ng ml 190 ng ml 200 ng ml 210 ng ml 220 ng ml 230 ng ml 240 ng ml 250 ng ml 260 ng ml 270 ng ml 280 ng ml 290 ng ml 300 ng ml 310 ng ml 320 ng ml 330 ng ml 340 ng ml 350 ng ml 360 ng ml 370 ng ml 380 ng ml 390 ng ml 400 ng ml 410 ng ml 420 ng ml 430 ng ml 440 ng ml 450 ng ml 460 ng ml 470 ng ml 480 ng ml 490 ng ml 500 ng ml 510 ng ml 520 ng ml 530 ng ml 540 ng ml 550 ng ml 560 ng ml 570 ng ml 580 ng ml 590 ng ml 600 ng ml 610 ng ml 620 ng ml 630 ng ml 640 ng ml 650 ng ml 660 ng ml 670 ng ml 680 ng ml 690 ng ml 700 ng ml 725 ng ml 750 ng ml 775 ng ml 800 ng ml 825 ng ml 850 ng ml 875 ng ml 900 ng ml 925 ng ml 950 ng ml 975 ng ml 1000 ng ml or more than 1000 ng ml. It should be appreciated that other inducer molecules are also compatible with methods described here and that optimization of the concentrations of such inducer molecules can be achieved through routine experimentation.

According to aspects of the invention high titers of DHBA and or 3 HBL are produced through the recombinant expression of genes associated with the invention in a cell. As used herein high titer refers to a titer in the milligrams per liter mg L scale. The titer produced for a given product will be influenced by multiple factors including choice of media.

In some embodiments the titer of DHBA is at least 25 mg L. For example the titer may be at least approximately 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 205 210 215 220 225 230 235 240 245 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320 325 330 335 340 345 350 355 360 365 370 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 625 650 675 700 750 775 800 or 900 mg L or 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8. 1.9 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 or more than 5 g L.

In some embodiments the titer for production of 3 HBL is at least 1 mg L. For example the titer may be at least approximately 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 105 110 115 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 or 900 mg L or 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 or more than 5 g L.

In some embodiments cells and methods associated with the invention can be used for production of glycolate. In some embodiments the titer for production of 3 HBL is at least 50 mg L. For example the titer may be at least approximately 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 205 210 215 220 225 230 235 240 245 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320 325 330 335 340 345 350 355 360 365 370 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 625 650 675 700 750 775 800 or 900 mg L or 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 or more than 5 g L.

As demonstrated in the Examples the use of more than one independent inducible expression system to express the collection of enzymes associated with the two integrated pathways led to surprisingly efficient production of DHBA and 3 HBL from intracellular glycolate. As shown in Example 10 MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with glycolate pathway plasmid pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose at 30 C. with varying concentrations of aTc resulted in titers of about 1.5 g L for induction levels of 250 ng ml to 500 ng ml. Moreover MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK and DHBA pathway plasmids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB cultured in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose on induction with 100 ng ml 250 ng ml and 500 ng ml aTc and 1 mM IPTG made up to 1 g L of glycolate even in the presence of the DHBA plasmids.

The 3 hydroxyalkanoic pathway can be modulated to produce more DHBA or 3 HBL through the presence or absence of the thioesterase TesB. In some embodiments recombinant expression of tesB leads to production of significantly more DHBA than 3 HBL. In some embodiments without tesB expression more 3 HBL is made than DHBA. Without wishing to be bound by any theory the small amount of DHBA formed in the absence of recombinant tesB may be due to the expression of genomic tesB as this gene is native to Huisman et al. 1991 .

Lactonization can be used to improve titers of 3 HBL. As used herein lactonization refers to formation of a lactone by intramolecular attack of a hydroxyl group on an activated carbonyl group. Supernatants from cultures that produce more DHBA than 3 HBL can be acidified such as through addition of hydrochloric acid to reduce the pH. Incubation of these supernatants for example at 37 C. overnight allows for acid catalyzed lactonization resulting in improved titers of 3 HBL. The observation that in the absence of tesB more 3 HBL is produced while little DHBA is made suggests that DHBA CoA can self lactonize into 3 HBL in vivo.

In some embodiments acid post treatment of culture supernatants increases 3 HBL titer by greater than 10 . In other embodiments acid post treatment of culture supernatants increases 3 HBL titer by greater than 100 . For example 3 HBL titers can be increased by approximately 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 or more than 250 including any intermediate values. In some embodiments acid post treatment of culture supernatants leads to a reduction in titer of DHBA of greater than 10 . For example titer of DHBA can be reduced by approximately 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 85 90 95 or more than 95 including any intermediate values.

The liquid cultures used to grow cells associated with the invention can be housed in any of the culture vessels known and used in the art. In some embodiments large scale production in an aerated reaction vessel such as a stirred tank reactor can be used to produce large quantities of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL.

Aspects of the invention include strategies to optimize production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL from a cell. Optimized production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL refers to producing a higher amount of a 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL following pursuit of an optimization strategy than would be achieved in the absence of such a strategy. One strategy for optimization is to increase expression levels of one or more genes associated with the invention through selection of appropriate promoters and ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments this may include the selection of high copy number plasmids or low or medium copy number plasmids. In some embodiments the plasmid is a medium copy number plasmid such as pETDuet. The step of transcription termination can also be targeted for regulation of gene expression through the introduction or elimination of structures such as stem loops.

In some embodiments it may be advantageous to use a cell that has been optimized for production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. In some embodiments screening for mutations that lead to enhanced production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL may be conducted through a random mutagenesis screen or through screening of known mutations. In some embodiments shotgun cloning of genomic fragments could be used to identify genomic regions that lead to an increase in production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL through screening cells or organisms that have these fragments for increased production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. In some cases one or more mutations may be combined in the same cell or organism.

Optimization of production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL can involve optimizing selection of bacterial strains for expression of recombinant pathways described herein. In some embodiments use of a bacterial strain that is close to wild type meaning a strain that has not been substantially genetically modified may lead to increased titers of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. For example in some embodiments use of a bacterial strain which expresses recA and or endA genes such as strain MG1655 DE3 leads to increased titers of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. Stereochemistry of molecules produced through the recombinant pathways described herein can be controlled by the choice of 3 hydroxybutyryl CoA reductase. In certain embodiments the use of PhaB results in R 3 hydroxyacids while the use of Hbd results in the S stereoisomer. In other embodiments the use of PhaB results in S 3 hydroxyacids while the use of Hbd results in the R stereoisomer. In some embodiments S DHBA and or S 3 HBL are produced while in other embodiments R DHBA and or R 3 HBL are produced. Methods and compositions described herein can also be applied to screen for an enzyme with similarity to hbd with similar stereochemical preference but with an increased substrate range for the production of R DHBA and R 3 HBL.

Optimization of protein expression may also require in some embodiments that a gene encoding an enzyme be modified before being introduced into a cell such as through codon optimization for expression in a bacterial cell. Codon usages for a variety of organisms can be accessed in the Codon Usage Database kazusa.or.jp codon .

In some embodiments protein engineering can be used to optimize expression or activity of one or more enzymes associated with the invention. In certain embodiments a protein engineering approach could include determining the 3D structure of an enzyme or constructing a 3D homology model for the enzyme based on the structure of a related protein. Based on 3D models mutations in an enzyme can be constructed and incorporated into a cell or organism which could then be screened for an increased production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL. In some embodiments production of 3 4 DHBA 2 3 DHBA and or 3 HBL in a cell could be increased through manipulation of enzymes that act in the same pathway as the enzymes associated with the invention. For example in some embodiments it may be advantageous to increase expression of an enzyme or other factor that acts upstream of a target enzyme such as an enzyme associated with the invention. This could be achieved by over expressing the upstream factor using any standard method.

Methods and compositions described herein for the production of 3 HBL 3 4 DHBA and 2 3 DHBA from sugars and sugar derived substrates have widespread applications. For example 3 HBL is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a building block for cholesterol reducing statins such as CRESTOR and LIPITOR antibiotics such as ZYBOX the anti hyperlipidemic medication E7EZETIMIBE Lee et al. 2008 Lee and Park 2009 HIV inhibitors Kim et al. 1995 and the nutritional supplement carnitine Wang and Hollingsworth 1999b .

3 HBL featured on the Department of Energy s list of top ten chemicals from biomass in a 2004 report. The annual market for statins was estimated to be 10 15 billion in 2003 and 2004 while the annual demand for L carnitine is estimated to be several hundred metric tons. Currently DHBA is not commercially available while 3 HBL costs 30 100 per gram. The high cost and low availability of these compounds increases the costs of statin drugs.

Economical biochemical synthesis of DHBA and 3 HBL employing glucose or other simple sugars derived from biomass as the only feedstock affords an opportunity for considerably reducing the cost of statin drugs. Further it may allow the use of these versatile building blocks for the economical synthesis of a variety of other drugs. For example DHBA and 3 HBL can be readily derivatized into the valuable nutritional supplement L carnitine which has an approximate cost of 5 per gram.

The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples which in no way should be construed as further limiting. The entire contents of all of the references including literature references issued patents published patent applications and co pending patent applications cited throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Glycolate synthesis was first investigated in the K 12 strain MG1655 DE3 transformed with pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK in LB and minimal medium. pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK is an IPTG inducible Duet vector which allows over expression of the glycolate pathway enzymes YcdW AceA and AceK. MG1655 DE3 cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK grown in minimal medium synthesized up to 0.7 g L of glycolate at the shake flask scale after 48 hours as compared to a maximum of 0.25 g L of glycolate observed in cells grown in LB on induction with IPTG. Experiments with the same strain only expressing YcdW off pCOLADuet ycdW or only YcdW and AceA off pCOLAduet ycdW aceA did not show any glycolate synthesis indicating that co expression of YcdW AceA and AceK was beneficial for glycolate production.

However the glycolate titers observed with MG1655 De3 carrying pCOLAduet ycdW aceA aceK were only observed transiently in the course of the four day fermentation and any glycolate synthesized was observed to be subsequently consumed by the cells presumably along one or more competing glycolate consumption pathways. To verify if this transiently synthesized glycolate could be converted to 3 HBL or DHBA MG1655 DE3 carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK was transformed with the DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB and the resulting strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with glucose. The resulting strain after induction with IPTG was expected to express the glycolate pathway and DHBA 3 HBL pathway enzymes off the three Duet vectors. However the resulting strain synthesized neither DHBA or 3 HBL nor any glycolate. Insufficient and transient glycolate synthesis was hypothesized as the reason for the inability of this strain to effectively synthesize DHBA and 3 HBL directly from glucose.

For the construction of a strain capable of sustained glycolate synthesis the genes iclR gcl aceB and glcB were knocked out from MG1655 DE3 to construct the strains MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB and MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB glcB. The iclR knockout is expected to relieve the transcriptional repression of the aceBAK operon to enhance endogenous AceA and AceK synthesis to complement the expression off pCOLADuet ycdW aceAa aceK. The gcl aceB and glcB knockouts eliminate some of the glyoxylate consumption pathways. Unlike the strains constructed in US 2009 0155867 the objective was not to construct a strain capable of maximum glycolate synthesis but rather to construct a strain capable of sustained glycolate synthesis that would be sufficient and optimized for DHBA synthesis. It should be noted that since acetyl CoA is a common intermediate for both glycolate and DHBA synthesis a strain engineered for maximum glycolate synthesis such as the one described in US 2009 0155867 may not necessarily be optimal for DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis.

Fermentations with MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB carrying pCOLAduet ycdW aceA aceK in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 wt. vol. glucose at 30 C. induced with 1 mM IPTG showed sustained glycolate synthesis with glycolate titers building up to 1.5 g L after three days. In contrast growth in LB resulted in more modest and transient titers of about 0.25 g L. Without wishing to be bound by any theory reduced titers in the presence of LB may be due at least in part to the fact that the glyoxylate shunt is heavily repressed in the presence of readily fermentable alternative carbon sources as found in a rich medium like LB. The effect of varying glucose supplementation on glycolate synthesis was also studied and in some embodiments 0.8 wt vol. glucose was found to be optimal for glycolate synthesis. In some embodiments glucose supply concentrations higher than 0.8 result in substantially lower glycolate titers potentially due to repression of the glyoxylate shunt in the presence of excess glucose. In some embodiments concentrations less than 0.8 of glucose were not sufficient.

Previous work has demonstrated production of glycolate in MG1655 strains that over express YcdW off a plasmid but only after 9 different genes were knocked out aceB gcl glcD glcE glcF aldA iclR eddA and eda US 2009 0155867 . By comparison herein comparable titers were achieved after only knocking out 3 genes iclR aceB gcl combined with co over expression of YcdW AceA and AceK using for example pCOLADuet. Strains described herein with fewer knockouts than those described in the prior art are likely to be healthier meaning better able to grow in minimal medium and better able to co express multiple pathway enzymes because they have many of the anaplerotic pathways critical for growth in minimal medium intact.

Fermentations with MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB glcB with the additional glcB knockout to eliminate expression of malate synthaseG carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK under similar conditions showed slightly lower glycolate titers of about 1.1 g L presumably due to adverse metabolic effects of this additional knockout to the inability of the cells to synthesize any malate.

To assess the fitness of strain MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB for DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB and MG1655 DE3 carrying the DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were cultured in shake flasks in LB supplemented with 1 glucose. The objective at least in part was to assess if the knockouts introduced in the strain MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB had somehow impaired DHBA or 3 HBL synthesis. The results indicated that strains MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB and MG1655 DE3 showed similar DHBA and 3 HBL titers at the shake flask scale indicating that the knockouts had not in any way impaired the ability of MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB to synthesize DHBA and 3 HBL from glucose and glycolate.

MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB transformed with pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK showed sustained glycolate synthesis in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose at 30 C. with titers as high as 1.5 g L on average. In earlier experiments in our laboratory we had observed DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis in MG1655 DE3 carrying pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB at the shake flask scale when supplied with 1.5 g L of glycolate externally in addition to glucose in LB. Thus given the observed titers of 1.5 g L of glycolate in the MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB strain transformed with pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK it was next investigated whether this endogenously synthesized glycolate could be efficiently converted to DHBA and 3 HBL in the MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB strain.

MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK glycolate pathay plasmid were transformed with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids . It was expected that the resulting MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB strain carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB would express all the pathway enzymes YcdW AceA AceK BktB PhaB Pct TesB synthesize glycolate from glucose and convert this endogenously synthesized glycolate to DHBA. However when this strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose at 30 C. it did not show substantial DHBA or 3 HBL synthesis. Moreover the cells also demonstrated negligible synthesis of glycolate less than 0.1 g L . Without wishing to be bound by any theory these results suggested that the presence of the two additional DHBA pathway plasmids imposed a metabolic burden on the cells impairing their ability to synthesize glycolate.

The effects of reduced acetyl CoA availability were investigated. Unlike growth in rich medium such as LB growth in minimal medium requires cells to synthesize all cell components from glucose the only available carbon source . The need to synthesize cell building blocks coupled with the burden of maintaining multiple plasmids and expression of multiple pathway enzymes can impose a considerable strain on cellular resources rapidly consuming glucose and reduce the acetyl CoA availability. Since acetyl CoA is required for synthesis of glycolate activation of glycolate to glycoly CoA and subsequent condensation for formation of DHBA and 3 HBL a limitation in its availability could potentially impair both glycolate and DHBA 3 HBL synthesis.

To determine whether reduced acetyl CoA availability contributed to poor glycolate synthesis MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were grown up in minimal medium supplemented with five different concentrations of glucose a 0.8 b 1 c 1.25 d 1.5 and e 2 . If acetyl CoA availability was substantially contributing to poor glycolate synthesis then increased glucose supplementation should alleviate it. However negligible glycolate synthesis was observed in each of the cases indicating that limited acetyl CoA availability was not causing poor glycolate synthesis.

Comparison of DHBA and 3 HBL Synthesis in MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB Carrying pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB in LB and Minimal Medium Supplemented with Glucose and Glycolate

To determine whether growth in minimal medium and resulting lower acetyl CoA availability affect DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis in cultures where glycolate is supplied externally to the cells MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying the DHBA 3 HBL pathway plamsids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were grown in a LB supplemented with 1 glucose and b minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose. 40 mM 3.3 g L glycolate was supplied to each set of the cultures. For the same strain titers of about 2 g L of DHBA were observed in the LB cultures while titers of only about 0.34 g L were observed in the minimal medium cultures indicating that reduced acetyl CoA availability in minimal medium indeed hampers DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis. Thus while reduced acetyl CoA availability did not appear to be a primary cause of poor glycolate synthesis in MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB carrying pCOLAduet ycdW aceA aceK and the DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids it did appear to affect DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis.

Thus as outlined in while MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying the glycolate pathway plasmid pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK produced 1.5 g L of glycolate at 1 mM IPTG induction level cells carrying both glycolate and DHBA pathway plasmids produced less than 0.1 g L of glycolate. Interestingly a considerable amount of 3 hydroxybutyrate 3 HB was observed to be synthesized by these cells. 3 HB is a byproduct of the metabolism of acetyl CoA by the DHBA and 3 HBL pathway enzymes. Without wishing to be bound by any theory these results suggested that the DHBA and 3 HB pathway enzymes were expressed in the cells and that the presence of the two additional DHBA pathway plasmids imposed a metabolic burden on the cells specifically impairing their ability to synthesize glycolate. To determine whether the expression of the glycolate pathway enzymes was affected in the presence of DHBA pathway plasmids the expression of all of the pathway enzymes in MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK along with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB was investigated as described below.

MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK and MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK along with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose and induced with 1 mM IPTG. MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying the empty vector pCOLADuet and those carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK along with pETDuet and pCDFDuet were grown up as control. Protein lysates were made 6 hours post induction and run on an SDS Polyacrylamide gel for separation of the expressed proteins. While distinct bands indicating over expression of YcdW and AceA were observed for MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying only pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK only faint bands corresponding to YcdW and AceA were observed for MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK in combination with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB. This strain however did show good expression of BktB PhaB Pct and TesB. Thus it appeared that in the presence of the DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids in addition to pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK only the DHBA and 3 HBL pathway enzymes BktB PhaB Pct and TesB were expressed well with minimal if any expression of glycolate pathway enzymes YcdW AceA and AceK . Without wishing to be bound by any theory the presence of multiple plasmids in the cells may result in a metabolic burden that manifests in the form of insufficient expression of glycolate pathway plasmids that prevents effective glycolate synthesis.

Distribution of T7 RNA polymerase between the multiple Duet vectors in strains carrying glycolate and DHBA 3 HBL pathway plasmids could cause reduced expression of pathway enzymes hampering glycolate DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis.

During growth under metabolically stressful conditions plasmid instability could result in mutated and or defective copies of plasmids that no longer encode correct enzymes or have hampered expression while conferring the same antibiotic resistance as before.

Plasmid instability can manifest in the form of a drastic structural changes such as those arising out of homologous recombination and b specific mutations that hamper expression without compromising antibiotic resistance. To determine whether plasmid instability in the form of drastic structural changes was the cause of the reduced ability to synthesize glycolate in the presence of DHBA and 3 HBL pathway plasmids MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were grown in minimal medium supplemented with glucose and plasmid minipreps were performed to isolate plasmids after 24 and 48 hrs post induction with 1 mM IPTG. In all cases all three plasmids pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were isolated and verified to be intact using restriction digests. While this did not rule out the possibility of mutations in the plasmids rendering them ineffective in expression it did indicate that the plasmids were not undergoing drastic structural changes.

MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB carries the DE3 prophage cassette integrated into its chromosome and synthesizes a certain amount of T7 RNA polymerase T7 RNAP on induction with IPTG. In an MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB strain carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB T7 RNAP in turn brings about transcription of the genes cloned into the three Duet vectors in front of T7lac promoters. The cells were expected to synthesize a certain fixed amount of T7 polymerase in response to induction with IPTG. In MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB carrying only pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK this T7 RNAP was expected to be distributed amongst the two T7lac promoter sites in front of ycdW and aceA aceK respectively. On the other hand in the presence of the three different Duet vectors pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB this same amount of T7 RNAP is now distributed amongst the 6 T7lac promoter sites. Thus the effective T7 RNAP available to initiate transcription from each promoter is substantially reduced at least 3 fold thereby affecting expression of the corresponding genes cloned in front of these promoters. Moreover expression off the Duet vector with the lower copy number was expected to suffer the most. Thus reduced T7 polymerase availability was expected to affect expression of pathway enzymes and hence synthesis of glycolate DHBA and 3 HBL. This hypothesis was investigated through the following experiments.

T7lac promoter region was Deleted from the pETDuet and pCDFDuet vectors to construct the plasmids T7lac pETDuet and T7lac pCDFDuet. Glycolate synthesis was then studied in the following strains.

Each of these strains were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose and induced using 1 mM IPTG after reaching an O.Dof about 0.6. As observed from just as before the strain carrying only pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK Strain 3 synthesized about 1.3 g L of glycolate while the strain carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB Strain 3A made negligible glycolate less than 0.1 g L . On the other hand the strain carrying the empty pETDuet and pCDFDuet plasmids Strain 3E made only about 0.9 g L of glycolate. While these empty plasmids do not contain any genes they still have intact T7lac promoter sites which can recruit T7 RNAP reducing its availability for expression off pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK.

By comparison the strain carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK T7lac pETDuet and T7lac pCDFDuet Strain 3 delta made roughly 1.3 g L of glycolate similar to the strain only carrying pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK . While these plasmids impose similar metabolic burden associated with plasmid maintenance as the empty vectors the lack of T7lac promoter sites prevents T7 RNAP sequestration by these plasmids. As a result all the T7 RNAP synthesized in this strain is exclusively available for expression off pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK. As a result this strain synthesizes 1.3 g L of glycolate. These results supported the hypothesis that T7 RNAP sequestration by pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB affects expression of the glycolate pathway genes off pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK preventing effective glycolate synthesis.

One approach investigated for overcoming the T7 RNAP availability problem was to distribute the DHBA 3 HBL and glycolate pathway plasmids between two independently inducible expression systems. This can be achieved by replacing the T7 polymerase dependent glycolate pathway plasmid pCOLADuet ycdW aceA aceK by cloning the glycolate pathway genes into a vector system that allows expression independent of T7 RNAP. This would decouple the two pathways increase the T7 polymerase available for the DHBA plasmids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB and allow independent control and reliable expression of the glycolate pathway enzymes by varying the concentration of the inducer molecule. The pKVS45 vector has a p15 origin of replication compatible with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB in terms of co replication. It contains a multi cloning site preceded by a tetracycline or anhydro tetracycline aTc inducible Tet promoter.

This plasmid confers resistance to ampicillin. To ensure compatibility with existing DHBA pathway plasmids a segment containing the origin of replication and Tet promoter and gene was PCR amplified and ligated with a Kanamycin resistance cassette to create the plasmid pHHD01K. Since the plasmid only contains a single multi cloning site the genes ycdW aceA and aceK were combined into an artificial operon similar to the naturally occurring aceBAK operon in structure. The artificial operon was constructed using SOEing Splicing by Overlap Extension polymerase chain reaction of the individual PCR amplified genes. The resulting ycdW aceA aceK operon was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pHHD01K to create the glycolate pathway plasmid pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK.

Transformation of MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB with the newly constructed glycolate pathway plasmid pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose at 30 C. with varying concentrations of aTc resulted in titers of about 1.5 g L for induction levels of 250 ng ml to 500 ng ml. Moreover MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK and DHBA pathway plasmids pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB cultured in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose on induction with 100 ng ml 250 ng ml and 500 ng ml aTc and 1 mM IPTG made up to 1 g L of glycolate even in the presence of the DHBA plasmids. This indicated that the strategy of replacing pCOLAduet ycdW aceA aceK with pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK to achieve reliable expression of the glycolate pathway enzymes had been successful. Further these strains also synthesized up to 0.12 g L DHBA.

This represented the first demonstration of synthesis of DHBA solely from glucose. Thus the strategy of relieving the metabolic burden by distributing the DHBA 3 HBL and glycolate pathway genes was not only successful in achieving reliable expression of all pathway enzymes but was also critical in allowing synthesis of DHBA solely from glucose.

Under metabolically stressful conditions such as growth in minimal medium controlling the expression of pathway enzymes is critical from the point of view of optimal distribution of cellular resources towards sustaining necessary life processes and expressing various pathway enzymes for effective product synthesis. While high inducer levels can achieve good enzyme expression they may deplete pools of critical metabolites such as acetyl CoA reducing pathway fluxes and product titers. Thus optimizing the levels of inducers is critical.

Since the level of induction by aTc was observed to have negligible effect on the DHBA concentration for aTc concentrations between 100 to 500 ng ml an aTc concentration of 250 ng ml was selected for induction to study the effect of IPTG inducer concentration. MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were cultured in minimal medium supplemented with 0.8 glucose 50 ml cultures and induced 250 ng ml of aTc and varying concentrations of IPTG 100 M 500 M and 1000 M . The following results were obtained.

As observed from the table above and highest DHBA titers of 0.21 g L were observed for an IPTG concentration of 100 M. As described earlier in Example 5 the supply glucose concentration affects acetyl CoA availability which in turn influences DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis. In minimal medium supplied with glycolate and 0.8 glucose MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB produced about 0.34 g L of DHBA. Thus the titer of 0.21 g L was improved to 0.34 g L and can likely be improved further by further reducing the metabolic burden by promoter replacements as discussed later. Titers can also be enhanced by enhancing acetyl CoA availability.

To investigate the effect of increased acetyl CoA availability fermentations were executed with varying amounts of glucose supplied to the cultures. MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB cells transformed with pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK pETDuet bktB phaB and pCDFDuet pct tesB were cultured in minimal medium supplemented with varying amounts of glucose 0.6 0.8 1 1.5 and induced using 250 ng ml of aTc and 100 M IPTG. As expected with increasing glucose concentrations the DHBA titers were observed to increase as observed from with increasing supply glucose concentration.

While increasing glucose supply concentrations enhances acetyl CoA availability for glycolate and DHBA synthesis it also increases fluxes towards by unwanted products. Excessive glucose can also repress the glyoxylate shunt and glycolate synthesis. Thus glucose supply concentration can be optimized to achieve selective DHBA and 3 HBL synthesis.

The above table shows that while the total moles of DHBA and 3 HBL were observed to increase with increasing amounts of glucose supplied to the cells in some embodiments an optimal selectivity is observed at about 1 supply concentration of glucose. From the table the observed yield on glucose on a molar basis was about 18 . The theoretical yield on glucose neglecting biomass accumulation and by product formation was about 44 . Thus in some embodiments the yield represents only about 27 of the theoretical maximum. Further enhancements in the yield may be achieved by reducing the metabolic burden of maintaining multiple plasmids. In some embodiments DHBA pathway enzymes are encoded by heterologous genes and thus are expressed off plasmids. However in some embodiments ycdW aceA and aceK are endogenous genes and thus can be expressed directly off the chromosome by replacing the native promoters preceding these genes with constitutive promoters of specific strength to achieve required expression.

The native promoters and ribosome binding sites RBSs preceding the gene ycdW and the genes aceA aceK in the chromosome of MG1655 DE3 iclR gcl aceB are replaced with constitutive promoters from the Anderson Promoter Library and RBSs from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts partsregistry.org . The objective is to construct a strain capable of expressing YcdW AceA and AceK at sufficiently high levels to eliminate the need to maintain multiple copies of the glycolate pathway plasmid pHHD01K ycdW aceA aceK for YcdW AceA and AceK expression.

One purpose of the technology described herein is to provide a general microbial biosynthetic route for the simultaneous production of a variety of structurally different 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids in cells such as cells using the unique ability of beta ketothiolases to effect Claisen condensation reactions in alternative ways between various precursor acids for carbon carbon bond formation. Aspects of the invention illustrate this unique carbon carbon bond forming potential of biosynthetic beta ketothiolase enzymes such as BktB from in the context of simultaneous microbial synthesis of the valuable chemicals 2 3 dihydroxyacid 2 3 DHBA and 3 4 dihydroxybutyric acid 3 4 DHBA from glucose.

The present invention provides methods for the biosynthesis of a variety of 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids using the ability of biosynthetic thiolase enzymes to catalyze a Claisen condensation reaction for carbon carbon bond formation in alternative ways between any two CoA thioesters derived from respective precursor small acid molecules to form structurally different 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids. The 3 hydroxyacid synthesis pathway described in a WO 2010 101651 Martin et al. and depicted schematically in employs 4 enzymes 1 CoA activator 2 thiolase 3 reductase and 4 thioesterase and depends on a Claisen condensation between acetyl CoA and a CoA thioester derived by CoA activation of a small acid molecule catalyzed by a biosynthetic thiolase for the synthesis of various 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids.

The initial Claisen condensation reaction catalyzed by the biosynthetic thiolase enzyme is a carbon carbon bond formation and in general can take place between any two CoA activated small acid molecules. demonstrates 4 alternative reaction products resulting from various condensation reactions in a mixture of two different CoA thioesters R1 CO S CoA and R2 CO S CoA that result in four different 3 ketoacyl CoA intermediates. The keto group in these intermediates can then be reduced stereospecifically by a reductase to form the corresponding 3 hydroxyacyl CoA intermediates. CoA cleavage by a thioesterase enzyme such as TesB from finally gives the corresponding 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids and hence governs the chemical structures of the final 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids synthesized using this pathway and the overall product distribution.

While in theory these 4 different products may be hypothesized to be formed from the condensation of any two CoA thioesters as shown in in reality the enzyme catalyzed synthesis of these products is expected to be limited by the accommodation of the substrates in the enzyme active site as well as the propensity of the substrates to participate in the different steps of catalysis depending on their chemical nature. In this sense the thiolase is the key pathway enzyme that governs the chemical structures of the final 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids synthesized and the overall product distribution. Indeed known natural reactions catalyzed by biosynthetic thiolases in pathways such as polyhydroxyalknoate synthesis butanol synthesis and isoprenoid biogenetic pathways are typically limited to condensation of acetyl CoA as one of the thioesters R1 H either with itself to form 3 hydroxybutyric acid or another small acid CoA thioester to form the corresponding 3 hydroxyalkanoic acid. illustrates the general mechanism of this reaction Masamune et al 1989 involving acetyl CoA R1 H as one of the thioesters condensing with Acyl CoA CoA Thioester 2 catalyzed by BktB the betaketothiolase from the poly 3 hydroxybutyrate and poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate synthesizing organism . For propionyl CoA R2 CH3 this condensation results in the formation of 3 ketovaleryl CoA precursor for 3 hydroxyvalerate . Key steps in this reaction mechanism involve a a nucleophilic attack by the sulfur atom of residue Cys90 in BktB onto propionyl CoA to form a propionyl enzyme complex and b a subsequent proton abstraction from acetyl CoA by Cys380 and a nucleophilic attack by the results acetyl CoA derived carbanion that results in the condensation product 3 ketovaleryl CoA as showed in . Similarly 3 hydroxybutyrate is formed as a pathway by product by the condensation of two acetyl CoA molecules with R1 H in Product 1 . Herein the reactions involving abstraction of an proton from acetyl CoA are referred to as Type I condensation reactions.

The products of the Type II condensation reaction Products 3 and 4 of the formation of which would involve abstraction of an proton from the other CoA thioester instead of acetyl CoA as shown in have not been reported previously. For example a reverse condensation between propionyl CoA and acetyl CoA would lead to the formation of 2 methyl 3 ketobutyryl CoA and eventually 2 methyl 3 hydroxybutyrate or condensation between two propionyl CoAs would give 2 methyl 3 ketohexanoyl CoA and 2 methyl 3 hydroxyhexanoic acid as the final product. While these reactions are possible the likelihood of these reactions depends on the ease of abstraction of an proton from propionyl CoA as well as favorable interactions of the resulting carbanion with the active site. Indeed these Type H condensation reactions defined herein as those involving abstraction of an proton from CoA thioesters other than acetyl CoA open up avenues towards microbial synthesis of a variety of structurally different 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids and extend the array of products that may be synthesized using the 3 hydroxylkanoic acid pathway well beyond those that may be simply accessed by Type I condensation reactions dependent on abstraction of protons from acetyl CoA.

Here the first instance of such a Type II reaction by the beta ketothiolase BktB is reported. It is demonstrated herein that cells expressing BktB as a biosynthetic thiolase along with the other 3 hydroxyacid synthesis pathway enzymes Pct as a CoA activator PhaB as a reductase and TesB as a thioesterase fed with glycolate synthesized 2 3 dihydroxybutyric acid 2 3 DHBA as a product formed from a Type II condensation between glycolyl CoA and acetyl CoA as well as forming 3 4 dihydroxybutyric acid 3 4 DHBA due to a Type I condensation reaction . 3 hydroxybutyric acid 3 HB was also synthesized due to direct condensation between two acetyl CoA molecules. While we have not yet detected the product of the reverse condensation between two glycolyl CoA molecules 2 3 4 trihydroxybutyric acid the formation of this species cannot be ruled out. This first time demonstration of the Type II condensation reaction between CoA thioesters now opens avenues towards synthesis of a variety of structurally diverse 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids.

To test for synthesis of 3 4 DHBA glycolate 40 mM was fed to MG1655 DE3 endA recA cells carrying pathway plasmids capable of expressing Pct Activator to activate glycolate to glycolyl CoA BktB Thiolase to bring about Claisen condensation PhaB Reductase to reduce keto group and TesB Thioestersae to cleave CoA from 3 4 DHBA CoA to give 3 4 DHBA . Supernatants from the culture medium were analyzed using 

a HPLC An Aminex H 87 column was used with 5 mM sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min. The 3 4 DHBA standard was detected at 11.45 mins on this column using a RID.

b LC MS 25 mM ammonium formate pH 2 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min with the same Aminex H87 column. The MS was set to detect ions of m z 138.1 corresponding to the expected mass of 3 4 DHBA ammonium adduct.

As observed from the LC time trace in there was a discrepancy of about 0.07 mins between the DHBA sample peaks and the standard. Also the DHBA peak was not a perfect symmetrical bell curve. This suggested that something else may be co eluting along with the 3 4 DHBA product.

To further confirm 3 4 DHBA synthesis LC MS was used. The MS was operated in a single ion detection mode set to detect the DHBA NH4 adduct ion. As observed from the ion count vs. time plots in the sample peak coincided with the DHBA 7.5 mM standard. An additional peak was observed immediately adjacent to on the right hand side the peak that coincided with the 3 4 DHBA standard. This species appeared to have the same m z ratio of 138.10 as the DHBA NH4 adduct ion and seemed to elute out of the Aminex column around the same time. The proximity of elution and the same m z ratio suggested that this co eluting species may be an isomer of 3 4 DHBA. In particular 2 3 DHBA is one such isomer that could be formed due to a Type II Claisen condensation reaction. It was hypothesized that this second peak could thus potentially correspond to 2 3 DHBA NH4.

3 4 DHBA standard on acid treatment results in lactonization with elimination of water to give 3 hydroxybutyrolactone 3 HBL resulting in an equilibrium ratio of 3 HBL 3 4 DHBA 2. However when the 3 4 DHBA from the LC traces was quantified assuming that the entire peak is attributable to 3 4 DHBA and these samples were treated with acid the 3 HBL 3 4 DHBA 0.6. This is clearly much lower than that observed for the standard under similar conditions indicating that the entire peak is not composed only of 3 4 DHBA but rather the observed peak is composed of 3 4 DHBA and something else that was co eluting around the same time as 3 4 DHBA.

As observed from the structure above the hydrogens connected to the alpha carbon atom in glycolic acids were replaced with deuterium. This deuterium labeled glycolate was fed to cells expressing the 3 4 DHBA pathway enzymes Pct BktB PhaB and TesB. Culture supernatants after t 72 hrs were analyzed on the LC MS. The two expected products for this labeled glycolate with their respective mechanisms of formation followed by the structures of the corresponding ammonium adduct products and their m z ratios are shown in .

Because the formation of the 2 3 DHBA labeled product involves abstraction of a deuterium it in fact differs in its m z ratio from the 3 4 DHBA labeled m z 140.1 product and would be expected to be detected in the single ion detection mode at m z 139.1. Indeed as observed from the LC MS time trace shown in cells fed with the deuterium labeled glycolate seemed to make both products as observed from the superimposed time traces. shows plots for a deuterium labeled glycolate fed culture supernatant sample analyzed on the LC MS at three different m z values in the single ion detection mode m z 140.1 m z 139.1 m z 138.1 and a control corresponding to the 3 4 DHBA unlabeled standard. The peak detected at m z 140.1 coincides with the 3 4 DHBA standard peak detected at m z 138.1 indicating that this peak indeed corresponds to the 3 4 DHBA labeled product . Two additional smaller peaks were observed at m z 139.1 the second of which after 14 mins coincided with the suspected 2 3 DHBA peak observed at the same position for flasks fed with unlabeled glycolate as seen in . It was concluded that this peak corresponded to the 2 3 DHBA labeled product formed due to the reverse condensation reaction between labeled glycolyl CoA and acetyl CoA.

Additionally flasks fed with unlabeled glycolate were run as controls. As earlier supernatants from these flasks showed two peaks when analyzed on the MS at m z 138.1 . While the first peak was observed to align with the unlabeled 3 4 DHBA standard the second peak was observed to align with the 2 3 DHBA labeled product providing evidence that indeed BktB could bring about the condensation reaction either way. The observation that the peak for 2 3 DHBA labeled was smaller than that for 2 3 DHBA unlabeled may be due to a greater difficulty in abstraction of deuterium or slower catalysis with the deuterium intermediate.

To obtain enough material for NMR about 5 mg preparative chromatography with the Aminex column was used. MG1655 DE3 endA recA cells carrying pathway plasmids capable of expression of Pct BktB PhaB and TesB were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 1 glucose. The cultures were induced with 100 M IPTG and culture supernatants were collected after 96 hrs. The pH of the culture supernatants was about 5.5 and was adjusted to about 7 to prevent acidification on evaporation of water which can result in conversion of 3 4 DHBA to 3 HBL . The water from the supernatant was evaporated using a steady stream of nitrogen blown over the surface to concentrate the culture supernatant from a volume of about 40 ml down to 1.6 ml. This concentrated solution was then repeatedly injected onto the Aminex column 50 separate 30 min runs and the fraction expected to contain DHBAs determined by collecting different fractions at 1 min intervals after injection of a DHBA standard was collected. The different fractions were combined the pH was adjusted back to close to neutral between 7 and 8 from pH 2 for the sulfuric acid mobile phase and the water was again evaporated this time completely to obtain dry residue of pure 2 3 DHBA and 3 4 DHBA. The dry residue was then re suspended in 0.75 mL of DO. The sample was reanalyzed on the HPLC to confirm that the two DHBAs had indeed been obtained in a pure form. This confirmed that DHBAs had been purified except for an unknown impurity that was carried forward during the purification. This also allowed quantification of DHBA. About 4.5 mg of the DHBAs combined was obtained. Most of this is expected to be 2 3 DHBA as much of the 3 4 DHBA is expected to be lactonized to 3 HBL due to evaporation of water despite the pH being adjusted to close to neutral . 3 HBL has a boiling point of 104 C. and as a result in some embodiments 3 HBL that is formed is expected to evaporate off with water. The resulting sample was analyzed using NMR confirming the presence of both 2 3 DHBA and 3 4 DHBA.

The established 3 hydroxyalkanoic acid synthesis pathway WO 2010 101651 Martin et al. allows synthesis of 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids by feeding small acid molecules via Type I Claisen condensation reaction between the corresponding activated small acid molecules and acetyl CoA catalyzed by thiolases like BktB. This pathway allows for the synthesis of 3 hydroxyvalerate 3 hydroxyhexanoate and 4 methyl 3 hydroxy valerate by feeding propionate butyrate and isobutyrate respectively. Type II Claisen condensation reaction observed with BktB as a thiolase may be effectively used to synthesize additional 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids that would not be able to be synthesized via a simple direct condensation reaction. In this sense the present invention is expected to enhance the versatility of the earlier established 3 hydroxyacid synthesis pathway towards synthesis of a vast array of 3 hydroxyalkanoic acids as value added products. The activity demonstrated by BktB is also likely to be also demonstrated by other thiolase enzymes that may exhibit a higher propensity towards the reverse condensation reaction or may be selectively engineered for enhanced reverse condensation activity for synthesis of specific value added products.

3 hydroxyalkanoic acids are valuable chiral molecules that can serve as pharmaceutical building blocks chiral precursors as well as valuable monomers for biodegradable polymers in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates. Biodegradable polymers currently employ 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxyvalerate due to the ease of synthesis of these acids. The properties of the resulting polymers are restricted by this limited choice of monomers. Alternative 3 hydroxyacids with different carbon chain lengths substituents and structures can serve as excellent monomers for altering and fine tuning polymer properties by forming co polymers.
