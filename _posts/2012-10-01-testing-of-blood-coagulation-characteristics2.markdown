This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 671 810 filed Jul. 16 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Medical devices and medical testing may be used to diagnose identify monitor or otherwise determine health related information. As one example blood coagulation screening tests such as Prothrombin Time PT Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time APTT Activated Clotting Time ACT fibrinogen content FIB and Thrombin Time TT may be performed by clinical laboratories health practitioners and the like. Each of these tests relates to a type of blood coagulation characteristic under a certain condition.

Clinicians may use these tests for various purposes such as to monitor anticoagulant therapy to screen for a single factor deficiency to screen for multiple factor deficiencies and or to screen for specific or non specific inhibitors. As one example unfractionated heparin therapy is widely used as a treatment for thromboembolic obstructive blood clots disorders. In some cases heparin therapy or the amount of heparin administered is determined based on the result of the APTT or ACT tests. However there are many pre analytical and analytical variables that can affect the PT APTT ACT FIB or TT measurements often giving dramatically different measurements from one test device or laboratory to another. This can produce a variance in the amount of a drug e.g. heparin or other therapy administered to the patient and may lead to less than optimal therapeutic results.

This disclosure includes techniques and arrangements for determining blood sample properties that are indicative of a blood coagulation characteristic of the blood sample. In some examples a blood sample is introduced into a sample receiver comprising a plurality of electrodes so that at least part of the blood sample and the plurality of electrodes are connected in an electrical circuit. For instance the sample receiver and the electrical circuit may be implemented in a device. The device may apply an electrical potential difference over the plurality of electrodes and at least part of the blood sample. The device can measure an electrical signal passing through the blood sample such as by taking a measurement at an output terminal of the circuit. The measurements may be taken over a measurement time duration to obtain a plurality of measurements representing a measurement function of time. An accumulative property of the measurement function can be determined such that the accumulative property correlates to a blood coagulation characteristic. The blood coagulation characteristic can be determined based at least in part on the accumulative property applied to the measurement function. In some cases the accumulative property may be based at least in part on an area associated with a segment of a curve of the electrical signal plotted over time. In other cases the accumulative property may be based at least in part on a change in amplitude of a portion of a curve of the electrical signal plotted over time.

Some examples herein may consider at least a portion of a curve of the measurements taken over time and can calculate quantities representative of blood coagulation characteristics based on the measurement curve. In contrast a conventional technique for testing blood coagulation includes detecting an endpoint or end state of a blood sample e.g. detecting a color change a flat point of an impedance curve a viscosity or other physical property . Thus conventional techniques may merely focus on determining a particular end state of the sample.

Some implementations herein are based at least partially on a premise that during coagulation there is an internal friction that gradually builds up against electrical conductivity thus resulting in an accumulated conductive energy loss. Accordingly this accumulative property is used in some examples herein to characterize the coagulation property of a blood sample. The accumulative property as disclosed herein may be an accumulated property of the acquired measurement function and may be related to at least two data points measurements in the measurement function over a period of time as opposed to a property at a single point of a curve such as viscosity or impedance of an end state of coagulation .

In addition some implementations herein are based at least in part on the intuition that the accumulated properties of the measurement function tells a more accurate and complete story of the coagulation process than the single end state property measurements conventionally used. Theories and explanations may be hypothesized herein to rationalize the observations. However the usefulness of the disclosed methods and devices based thereon and more importantly the scope of the claims provided in this application do not rely on nor are limited by the correctness or soundness of any hypothesized theories premises or explanations. Further the disclosure does not require a superior performance of the disclosed methods devices or techniques.

For discussion purposes some example implementations are described in the environment of a test device and system for testing blood coagulation properties. However the implementations herein are not limited to the particular examples provided and may be extended to other types of devices apparatuses and systems and other types of testing as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in light of the disclosure herein.

In the framework a blood sample may be received by a blood sample receiver . As several examples a small blood sample may be applied to a reagent strip a cartridge a cassette a sample receptor or the like that may be part of the device or that may be introduced to the device inserted into the device connected to the device etc. Accordingly implementations herein are not limited to any particular apparatus or technique for providing a blood sample to a blood sample receiver of the device .

An electrical potential difference may be applied to the blood sample received by the blood sample receiver . As indicated at an electrical signal passing through the blood sample may be measured over a period of time to produce a plurality of measurements . For example the measurements may indicate at least one of a change in voltage or a change in current over a period of time as a result of applying the electrical potential difference to the blood sample . As another example the measurements may be derivative values of an electrical signal measured over time.

Based on the measurements and the period of time a measurement function of time may be determined. In some examples the measurement function of time may be expressed as a graphic representation such as a curve that represents the measured electrical signal over the period of time. However in other examples a graphic representation need not be produced in order to apply or use the measurement function of time . Based on the measurement function of time at least one accumulative property may be determined. For example the accumulative property may correspond to a portion of the measurement function of time and may be correlated to a blood coagulation characteristic . In some examples the curve of the measurement function e.g. the signal curve may be divided into four processes each of which may be correlated to a different blood coagulation condition. Information related to the blood coagulation characteristic may be provided to any of various targets such as a display a storage medium and or a computing device.

The test cartridge further includes a delivery channel that may connect the reaction area with a sample well or receptacle . For example a quantity of sample blood may be delivered to the receptacle as the blood sample . The sample blood may flow through the delivery channel to the reaction area . For example capillary action may draw the blood sample from the sample receptacle to the reaction area .

The test cartridge may further include a plurality of electrodes to form an electrochemical cell. For example a first electrode may connect to a first portion of the reaction area and a second electrode may connect to a second portion of the reaction area . A third electrode also connects to the reaction area . In this example the electrochemical cell at the reaction area consists of three electrodes such as a working electrode a counter electrode and a reference electrode. In other examples the counter and reference electrodes may be combined to provide a two electrode configuration.

Accordingly it may be seen that when the blood from the blood sample enters the reaction area the blood sample is positioned between a plurality of electrodes such as the first electrode and the second electrode . Further the blood sample may interact with the reagent or other substance in the reaction area in examples in which a reagent or other substance is used during testing of a blood sample. Additionally while a single electrochemical cell is shown in this example in other examples multiple electrochemical cells may be included to provide multiple reaction areas . For instance different reaction areas may include different types of reagents or substances suitable for different types of tests. These reaction areas could be connected through channels to a single sample receptacle .

One application for which the test cartridge may be applied is a heparin test. For example a heparin neutralizer may be a reagent located in the reaction area adjacent to the electrodes. A blood sample is introduced at the sample receptacle and is delivered by the delivery channels to the reaction area . Within the reaction area the blood sample reacts with the reagent which may trigger a series of biochemical reactions leading to coagulation. In the reaction area the blood sample is in contact with the plurality of electrodes . As discussed additionally below when the test cartridge is inserted into a device the electrodes and the blood sample located in the reaction area become an electrochemical part of a complete circuit for testing of the blood sample . For instance the device may apply an electrical potential difference over the electrodes to detect an electrical signal at an output terminal of the circuit over a period of time i.e. a measurement time duration to obtain a plurality of measurements which represent a function of time i.e. a measurement function of time .

The device includes the blood sample receiver which in this example includes a cartridge receiver and a heater . For example the heater may ensure that the blood sample is maintained at a uniform temperature during testing to ensure uniformity of testing across a plurality of samples. Additionally in other examples the blood sample receiver may have a different configuration depending on the technique actually used for delivering a blood sample to the device .

The device may further include a plurality of electrical connections for connecting the electrodes of the test cartridge with a circuit of the device . For example the electrodes may be connected to a power source and an analog digital converter . The power source may provide an electrical potential difference across the blood sample in the reaction area of the test cartridge during testing of the blood sample . The A D converter may measure a resulting electrical signal such as at an output terminal. In some cases the output terminal may correspond to one or more of the electrodes .

The device may further include one or more processors one or more computer readable media a display a power adapter port and one or more communication interfaces such as an external data port or other suitable communication interface as discussed below. For example the processor s may be any of a control logic circuit a central processing unit a microprocessor or other suitable type of processor. In some examples each processor may itself comprise one or more processors or processing cores. Alternatively in other examples the device may be a thin component having minimal processing resources merely sufficient to execute a test function or test module during use of the device while additional processing may be executed remotely on a computing device or other device able to communicate with the device through the communication interface .

Depending on the configuration of the device the computer readable media may be an example of tangible non transitory computer storage media and may include volatile and nonvolatile memory and or removable and non removable media implemented in any type of technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data. Such computer readable media may include but is not limited to RAM ROM EEPROM flash memory or other computer readable media technology computer storage technology or any other medium that can be used to store information and which can be accessed by the processor directly or through another computing device. Accordingly the computer readable media may include computer storage media able to store and maintain instructions modules or components executable by the processor .

The computer readable media may be used to store any number of functional components that are executable by the processor . In some implementations these functional components comprise instructions code or programs that are executable by the processor and that when executed implement operational logic for performing the actions attributed to the device . Functional components of the device maintained in the computer readable media may include the test module executable by the processor to perform testing on a blood sample such as for applying an electrical potential difference across the blood sample and obtaining measurements of an electrical signal. The functional components may further include an analysis module which may be executed by the processor to perform some functions described herein such as determining a measurement function of time one or more corresponding accumulative properties and or a blood coagulation characteristic . For example the analysis module may further determine a blood coagulation characteristic based at least in part on an accumulative property and or the measurements or measurement function of time . Additionally the computer readable media may store data such as measurements the measurement function of time the accumulative propert ies the blood coagulation characteristics or information related thereto and so forth. In addition depending on the type of the device the computer readable media may also optionally include other functional components and data such as a user interface module a communication module medical histories past blood coagulation test results or other modules applications programs drivers data and the like.

The measurements taken by the device with respect to the blood sample may be stored in the computer readable media and analyzed such as by execution of the analysis module by the processor . The analysis module may determine a quantitative value of an accumulative property of the measurement function . The accumulative property may be derived or selected empirically prior to taking the measurements or in some cases prior to making the device . For example the standard for selecting a suitable accumulative property is usually to obtain a good correlation with a blood coagulation characteristic to enable the accumulative property to be used to determine the blood coagulation characteristic .

In some examples the processing for determining the measurement function of time the accumulative property and or the blood coagulation characteristics may be performed by the processor executing the analysis module on the device . In other examples some or all of the processing may be performed by the external computing device . For example the device may provide the measurements to the computing device and the computing device may execute an analysis module on a processor of the computing device to determine the measurement function of time apply the accumulative property and or determine the blood coagulation characteristic . In such a situation the test module or other suitable application or communication module on the device may communicate with the computing device over a connection to provide the measurements to the computing device . In other examples the computing device may expose programmatic interfaces or APIs application programming interfaces that the device can use to provide the measurements . In other examples rather than providing the measurements the device may provide the blood coagulation characteristic or information related to the blood coagulation characteristic to the computing device .

The test device may include one or more communication interfaces that may be used to communicate with the computing device for accessing and interacting with one or more modules on the computing device . In some examples the communication interface may support wired and or wireless connection to various networks such as cellular networks radio communications Wi Fi networks short range or near field networks e.g. Bluetooth infrared signals local area networks wide area networks the Internet a direct cable connection and so forth. As one example the communication interface may include a USB universal serial bus port an IEEE 802.3 port or other wired connection. In other examples the communication interface may allow the device to access a wireless communication network or device.

The test device may further be equipped with various other input output I O components not shown in . Such I O components may include various user controls e.g. buttons a joystick a keypad etc. speakers a microphone and so forth. For example the device may include suitable drivers configured to accept input from a keypad or other user controls and devices included as the I O components. Additionally depending on the type the device may include various other components that are not shown in this example.

Blood clotting may include three stages. During a first stage vessel wall injury or trauma triggers the attachment and activation of platelets. In the second stage activated platelets provide surfaces for the assembly and activation of coagulation factors and complexes. In the third stage the coagulation factors interact to produce thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin strands bind aggregated platelets to help secure a platelet fibrin hemostatic plug. The second and third stages of blood coagulation may be referred to as a coagulation cascade for the interaction among each of the coagulation factors. These are the major stages of blood clotting because of the formation of thrombin in these stages. Thrombin is a clotting effecter enzyme having many biologically important functions such as the activation of platelets conversion of fibrinogen to a fibrin network and feedback amplification of coagulation. The coagulation cascade can be generalized as three pathways an intrinsic pathway an extrinsic pathway and a common pathway. The intrinsic pathway may be triggered by surface contact while the extrinsic pathway may be triggered by tissue cell defect. Both can lead to the formation of thrombin which is the common pathway. Thrombin converts the fibrinogen into fibrin and then the fibrin may form a cross linked fibrin meshwork.

When the blood sample is deposited in the sample receptacle the blood is carried forward by a capillary action to reach the reaction area as discussed above. In the example discussed above the reaction area contains multiple electrodes which may apply an electrical potential difference across the blood sample in the reaction area . In some examples the electrical potential difference may be a constant voltage applied by the device to the electrodes . In other examples the voltage or current may be varied the current may be an alternating current or the like.

In some implementations the electrical signal detected at an output terminal such as first electrode or second electrode is the electrical current that passes through the blood sample in the reaction area or an electrical current that is related to the electrical current that passes through the blood sample. The curve of illustrates an example of the behavior of the current response i.e. the electrical signal due to the coagulation reaction in the blood sample which may have also reacted with one or more reagents .

In the example of the current is shown by the curve to have increased rapidly at first to reach a first peak at time t. This result may be attributed to the blood sample forming an electrical connection between opposing electrodes e.g. the first electrode and the second electrode . The time point tmay be the time at which the electrodes make a complete electrical connection through the blood sample. The process during the time span from the initial time to the first peak at time tis referred to as process one in this example.

After time t the current starts to drop. This result may be attributed to a process of fibrinogen being converted to fibrin to form insoluble products. This process may also be accompanied by the clotting cascade being activated which leads to thrombin production. The curve shows a drop in current passed through the blood sample as this activity takes place until a first bottom of the curve is reached at a time t. The process from the first peak at time tto the first bottom at time tof the curve is referred to as process two in this example.

From time tat the first bottom of the curve the current then starts to gradually increase again to reach a second peak at time t which may be a result of a process of fibrinogen changing to fibrin under the catalysis of thrombin and further starting to form small particles. The process from the first bottom at time tto the second peak at time t is referred to as process three in this example.

After the second peak at time t the current begins to go down again slightly or may remain steady in some cases . This process may be due to mesh formation of fibrin accompanied by the sedimentation of fibrin. The process following time t at the second peak is referred to as process four in this example.

Conventional examples of prothrombin time determination such as PT monitoring may be based upon an end state determination using slope calculation. However this technique is not suitable for the other types of anticoagulation monitoring such as heparin dosage monitoring.

Disclosed herein is a new technique for coagulation monitoring which may be referred to as the Residual Accumulative Conductive Energy RACE method. According to the RACE method disclosed herein the curve of the measurement function e.g. the measured electrical signal may be divided or segmented according to the four processes and as discussed above with respect to . The method uses RACE as an empirical accumulative property of the time function of the measurements of the electrical signal. The computed value of RACE may be used to estimate a coagulation characteristic rather than the conventional technique of end state determination such as based on slope calculation.

RACErepresents an accumulated change of a coagulation process. The time t is the time at which the blood sample begins sedimentation of fibrin and the time tis the time at which the electrodes and the blood sample in the reaction area are electrically connected. The area Ais the first integrated area computed by integrating variable values of the electrical current from time tto time t which is a characteristic time period within the measurement time duration. Accordingly the area Arepresents a total residual conductive energy accumulated during the process two and the process three . The area Ais the second integrated area computed by integrating a difference between the variable values and a fixed minimum value at time t of the current over the characteristic time period which in this case is the time from time tto time t .

Power indexes n m and p are empirical parameters. Experiments have shown that setting the empirical parameters n m and p substantially close to 1 1 and respectively can result in relatively good correlation between RACEand one or more commonly used coagulation characteristics such as PT ACT or APTT.

Further this disclosure is not limited to the particular formula described above with respect to Equation 1 nor is this disclosure limited to particular values of the empirical parameters n m and p which may be preferable for certain applications.

As one example application four components of the clotting cascade are dependent on vitamin K content. These four components are tissue thromboplastin Factor II TF factor IX factor X and prothrombin. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant medication widely used for the prevention of thromboembolic events including deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism myocardial infarction and stroke. Warfarin is a vitamin K analogue and therefore warfarin therapy targets these elements of the clotting cascade which has a largest impact on the extrinsic pathway. Warfarin does not have direct anticoagulant properties but exerts its effects by inhibiting vitamin K pathway dependent clotting factors II VII IX X and the antithrombotic proteins C and S.

The Prothrombin Time PT test may be used to assess the extrinsic and common pathway clotting systems and for monitoring long term anticoagulation therapy. Accordingly implementations herein may use RACEas discussed above to determine a Prothrombin Time PT test results for wafarin monitoring wherein RACEis calculated by the Equation 1. For example a suitable reagent may be used for PT testing by taking a plurality of measurements of an electrical signal passed through a blood sample introduced to the reagent. The accumulated property may be determined using the RACEtechnique discussed above and the PT test results may be determined based on the RACEresults.

As illustrated in line represents the best fit line of the experimental results as represented with a plurality of diamonds for PT in a range of 9.7 92.9 seconds. In this example the line may be expressed as y 11691x 30983 and the correlation coefficient R 0.92. The results show that there is a sufficient correlation between the RACEresults and the results of the Sysmex PT results such that the RACEresults may be used to obtain PT test results.

The RACEtechnique disclosed herein may also be used for heparin monitoring. Heparin is a common medication connected with cardiac bypass surgery cardiac catheterization renal dialysis and in critical care situations for acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with heparin causes the inactivation of thrombin. Heparin exerts an anticoagulation effect by binding to and forming a complex with a plasma cofactor called antithrombin III.

Accordingly the RACEtechnique discussed above may be employed to monitor heparin in blood such as by including the reagent thrombin as the reagent on the cartridge . In some examples herein the RACEtechnique may even result in a wider signal detection range than conventional methods and detection of heparin concentrations lower than 1 U ml. Thus the accumulative property discussed above with respect to may provide a close correlation with heparin concentration in a blood sample and may be correlated as an APTT or ACT test result and or used as such. Conventionally heparin concentrations lower than 1.5 U mL are often monitored by APTT while heparin concentrations higher than 1.5 U mL are often monitored by ACT.

The areas Q and Q may be used for correlation with tests such as TT or APTT. For example a first suitable reagent such as thromboplastin may be used for correlation with APTT testing by taking a plurality of measurements of an electrical signal passed through a blood sample introduced to the first reagent. A different second suitable reagent such as thrombin may be used for correlation with TT testing by taking a plurality of measurements of an electrical signal passed through a blood sample introduced to the second reagent. The following equation may be used for correlation with either or both of APTT and TT testing.

RACEor RACEmay be empirically determined according to the following equation RACEor RACE where Equation 2

RACEor RACErepresents an accumulated change of a coagulation process. The area Qis the first integrated area computed by integrating variable values of the electrical current from time tto time t which is a characteristic time period within the measurement time duration. Accordingly the area Qrepresents a total residual conductive energy accumulated during the process two . The area Qis the second integrated area computed by integrating variable values of the electrical current from time tto time t which is another characteristic time period within the measurement time duration. Accordingly the area Qrepresents a total residual conductive energy accumulated during the process three .

Constant k may be an empirical parameter. Experiments have shown that setting the empirical parameter k substantially close to 1 can result in substantial correlation between RACEand or RACEand one or more commonly used coagulation characteristics such as APTT or TT respectively. Further this disclosure is not limited to the particular formula described above with respect to Equation 2 nor is this disclosure limited to particular values of the empirical parameter k which may be preferable for certain applications.

TT measures the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. As one example this test may be performed by the addition of purified thrombin to patient plasma. The resulting clotting time is a function of fibrinogen concentration and activity. The TT may be used as a screening test for the presence of heparin in a plasma sample. Other causes for a prolonged TT include quantitative deficiency of fibrinogen qualitative abnormality of fibrinogen dysfibrinogen elevated levels of fibrin degradation products FDP the presence of certain paraproteins and markedly increased levels of fibrinogen. illustrates an example of correlation between RACE results based on Equation 2 and Sysmex TT results for eight samples using a Sysmex CA 500 as a reference lab system. Each of the eight samples was spiked with a different concentration of heparin and tested using both the RACE technique of Equation 2 and the Sysmex CA 500 reference lab system. In the illustrated example the line indicates the best fit line of the experimental data points as represented with the diamonds . The line may be represented as y 51.503x 5629.5 for TT in the range of 19 152 seconds. The correlation coefficient R 0.92 which is sufficient to correlate the RACEresults to provide TT testing results.

In addition to using the above described RACE techniques of Equation 1 and Equation 2 to characterize the coagulation changes in a blood sample additional RACE techniques herein may be used for determining blood coagulation characteristics such as fibrinogen content FIB . For determining FIB characteristics a different accumulative property of the measurement function may be empirically derived which is denoted herein as RACE for satisfactory correlation with FIB measurement.

Fibrinogen is acted upon by thrombin to produce fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin strands and ultimately a fibrin clot. Not all fibrinogen molecules are capable of participating in clot formation and only clottable fibrinogen is of interest for the purpose of hemostasis screening. Fibrinogen assays available on current automated coagulation analyzers include the Clauss and PT derived methods. In some cases PT APTT and platelet assays are sufficient for screening bleeding patients. However in cases where fibrinogen levels may drop precipitously e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation in obstetric patients a fibrinogen assay may be used as a screening test since the PT and APTT tests are relatively insensitive to low levels of fibrinogen.

Thus the RACEis an accumulated value of the process two that uses the difference in amplitude AD the electrical signal amplitude at the first peak at time t and AD the electrical signal amplitude at the first bottom at time t and which represents the process of fibrinogen converting to fibrin. The power index r in Equation 2 is an empirical parameter which may be 1 or close to 1. The results of the RACEequation may be correlated to fibrinogen content in a blood sample. For example the blood sample may be prepared for measuring fibrinogen content the electrical signal may be measured over time and the accumulative property RACE can be correlated to the fibrinogen content of the blood sample.

Exemplary implementations are employed to illustrate the concept and implementation of the present invention in this disclosure. The exemplary implementations are only used for better understanding of the method and core concepts of the present invention. Based on the concepts in this disclosure a technician of ordinary skill in the art may make some modifications. These modifications should also be under the scope of the present invention.

At the device receives a blood sample in an electrochemical cell that includes a plurality of electrodes such that the blood sample and the plurality of electrodes are connected in a circuit.

In some cases the accumulative property may be based at least in part on determining an area corresponding to a segment of a curve of the electrical signal measurements plotted over time.

At the test device determines a blood coagulation characteristic based at least in part on the plurality of measurements taken over time between a first peak of the electrical signal and a second peak of the electrical signal. For example the test device may correlate an area calculated based on a segment of a curve of the electrical signal to a blood coagulation characteristic. For instance the curve segment may extend from a first peak to a second peak of the curve. Alternatively the test device may correlate a change in an amplitude of a curve segment of the electrical signal to a different blood coagulation characteristic. For instance the curve segment may extend from the first peak to the first bottom of the curve.
