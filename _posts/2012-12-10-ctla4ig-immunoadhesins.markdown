The present application relates to CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins that target CD80 and CD86 and their use particularly for therapeutic purposes.

T lymphocytes play a central role in the adaptive immune response to antigen. Naive T cells require two signals for their full activation Bretscher 1999 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96 185 90 . The first signal is antigen specific and is provided by interaction of the T cell receptor TCR with MHC peptide complex on an antigen presenting cell APC . The second signal is a costimulatory signal provided by the interactions between receptors on the T cell and their ligands on the APC. Engagement of both TCR MHC and co stimulatory interactions leads to T cell activation via a number of intracellular pathways including calcium calcineurin and RAS mitogen activated protein kinase and subsequent activation of transcription factors for a number of effector compounds including cytokines such as IL 2. These events lead to T cell proliferation generation of a CD4helper T cell T pool and expansion of activated CD8cytotoxic T cells. Not only is co stimulation critical for full T cell activation its absence during TCR MHC engagement results in anergy and or apoptosis.

Although multiple positive and negative costimulatory pathways are involved in T cell regulation the most critical are between CD28 on T cells and B7 1 CD80 and B7 2 CD86 on APCs. CD28 promotes T cell differentiation into TH1 phenotype cells and enhances antibody production by B cells and activation of T cells. B7 1 and B7 2 expressed on APCs such as dendritic cells DC and B cells have overlapping but distinct functions. B7 2 is constitutively expressed and is rapidly upregulated on APCs coincident with TCR MHC engagement signal 1 . B7 1 expression is very low on the resting cell but is typically induced after prolonged T cell stimulation. These differences suggest that while B7 2 may be important in initialization of T cell activation B7 1 may play a greater role in perpetuating the immune response.

Subsequent to T cell activation a negative regulatory receptor Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 CTLA4 or CTLA 4 also called CD152 is upregulated on T cells Alegre et al. 2001 Nat Rev Immunol 1 220 8 . CTLA4 is structurally homologous to CD28 but binds more tightly to both B7 1 and B7 2 ligands. CLTA4 inhibits the immune response in two principal ways it competes with CD28 for the B7 ligands and thus blocks costimulation and it also negatively signals to inhibit T cell activation Krummel and Allison 1995 J Exp Med 182 459 465 Walunas et al. 1994 Immunity 1 405 413 . Recent work has shown that B7 2 engages CD28 more than CTLA4 at the immune synapse while B7 1 ligates more CTLA4 than CD28 Collins et al. 2002 Immunity 17 201 210 Jansson et al. 2005 J Immunol 175 1575 1585 .

Because of the critical role of the B7 co stimulatory pathway in promoting and maintaining immune response therapeutic agents designed to antagonize it are promising for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders. Abatacept Orencia is a CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin consisting of the extracellular binding domain of CTLA4 linked to the Fc domain of a human IgG. Abatacept was developed to inhibit B7 mediated costimulation Bluestone et al. 2006 Immunity 24 233 238 and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA and in clinical trials for a number of other autoimmune indications. However whereas abatacept shows some activity in treating RA it is not effective for other indications. For example CTLA4 Ig is far less efficacious in tolerance against transplant rejection Kirk et al. 1997 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94 8789 8794 Levisetti et al. 1997 J Immunol 159 5187 5191 .

The deficient clinical performance of abatacept has been attributed to its suboptimal affinity of native CTLA4 for the B7 ligands particularly B7 2 due to its presumed importance in the initiation of immunity. The present invention provides novel variant CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins with improved B7 affinities and enhanced T cell inhibitory activities. Such novel immunoadhesins are of benefit in a variety of applications particularly for treating immune related disorders as discussed in detail below.

The present invention is drawn to novel variant CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins with improved B7 affinities and enhanced T cell inhibitory activities. Such novel immunoadhesins are of benefit in a variety of applications as discussed in detail below.

CTLA4 Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 also referred to as CTLA 4 and also known as CD152 Cluster of differentiation 152 is a protein that plays an important regulatory role in the immune system. In humans the CTLA4 protein is encoded by the CTLA4 gene the translated amino acid sequence of which is provided in SEQ ID NO 1. CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is structurally homologous to CD28 a T cell costimulatory protein. CTLA4 binds to costimulatory ligands B7 1 and B7 2 on the surface of antigen presenting cells APCs . CLTA4 inhibits immune response in two principal ways it competes with CD28 for binding to B7 1 and B7 2 and thereby blocks costimulation and it negatively signals to inhibit T cell activation. A particularly important region of the CTLA4 protein for the present invention is the extracellular domain ECD SEQ ID NO 2 which mediates binding to B7 1 and B7 2 ligands on APCs.

As a result of the critical role of the B7 co stimulatory pathway in promoting and maintaining immune response it is desirable to provide therapeutic agents designed to antagonize this pathway. Accordingly the present invention provides CTLA4Ig immunoadhesions

 Immunoadhesin refers to a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to an Fc region. Immunoadhesin as used herein is synonymous with the terms Fc fusion Ig fusion receptor Fc fusion Ig chimera and receptor globulin sometimes with dashes and TRAPs as used in the prior art Chamow et al. 1996 Trends Biotechnol 14 52 60 Ashkenazi et al. 1997 Curr Opin Immunol 9 195 200 both entirely incorporated by reference . An immunoadhesin combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner which in general can be any protein or small molecule that has specificity for a target protein. Thus immunoadhesins have two principal portions a target binding portion and an Fc portion. The target binding portion may have specificity for virtually any target or target antigen. The Fc portion may bind to one or more Fc receptors or Fc ligands. Fusion partners may be linked to any region of an Fc region including at the N or C termini or at some residue in between the termini. While virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion and thus target virtually any target immunonoadhesins of the present invention comprise a CTLA4 or a variant of CTLA4 as a fusion partner. The fusion of CTLA4 with an Ig Fc region is referred to herein as a CTLA4 Ig or CTLA4 Ig protein.

The target binding portion or fusion partner of the immunoadhesins of the invention are comprised of the protein CTLA4. Thus the immunoadhesins of the invention are directed to bind B7 1 B7 2 and any other ligands or receptors known or unknown that are bound by CTLA4. The target binding portion of the invention may comprise an amino acid sequence that is made up of all any or part of the human CTLA4 protein SEQ ID NO 1 . Preferably the immunoadhesin binding portion comprises all or part of the ECD of CTLA4 SEQ ID NO 2 . As described in the examples the immunoadhesin binding is preferably a variant of CTLA4 that improves binding to B7 1 B7 2 or both B7 1 and B7 2 and in some cases shows preferential binding to one or the other.

The CTLA4 variants comprise at least one amino acid modification in a native CTLA4 protein generally the human CTLA4 protein depicted in SEQ ID NO 1 and in most cases the variants are within the extracellular domain as the entire CTLA4 protein is generally not used in the fusion proteins of the invention. In this embodiment one or more modifications are made at one or more of the following positions numbering as in SEQ ID NO 2 29 30 31 33 35 49 51 53 59 61 63 64 93 95 97 98 102 103 104 105 or 106. In some embodiments the modification is one or more of the following substitutions A29E A29F A29H A29K A29N A29Q A29R T30E T30H T30R T30V E31D E31I E31M E31T E31V R33E R33F R33I R33L R33M R33Q R33T R33W R33Y T35D T35E T35F T35M T35V T35Y A49D A49E A49F A49T A49W A49Y T51D T51E T51H T51L T51N T51Q T51R T51S T51V M53E M53F M53H M53Q M53W M53Y T59H T59I T59L T59N T59Q T59V T59Y L61A L61D L61E L61F L61G L61H L61I L61K L61M L61N L61P L61Q L61R L61S L61T L61V L61W L61Y D63E S64K S64R S64Y K93D K93E K93F K93H K93N K93Q K93R K93S K93T K93V K93W K93Y E95D E95H E95L E95Q E95Y M97D M97F M97I M97N M97V Y98F Y98W Y102F Y102W Y103D Y103E Y103F Y103H Y103N Y103Q Y103W L104F L104H L104M L104V L104Y G105D G105E I106E and I106Y Of particular use in some embodiments are CTLA4 variants that have one or more substitutions selected from A29H T51N M53Y L61E and K93Q with combinations of particular use including A29H K93Q A29H M53Y A29H T51N T51N K93Q T51N M53Y A29H L61E K93Q A29H M53Y K93Q A29H M53Y L61E A29H T51N L61E M53Y L61E K93Q T51N L61E K93Q T51N M53Y L61E A29H M53Y L61E K93Q A29H T51N L61E K93Q A29H T51N M53Y K93Q A29H T51N M53Y L61E T51N M53Y L61E K93Q and A29H T51N M53Y L61E K93Q 

As for all the lists of positions and substitutions herein it should be understood that combinations of individual substitutions can be made of any and all possible combinations and that any individual position or substitution can be independently included or excluded from the list of possibilities. In general as compared to the wild type or parent CTLA4 or Fc region generally the variants of the invention have 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acid substitutions in the CTLA4 region although in some cases more substitutions can be used as long as the desired function is preserved. Similarly as described below the Fc domain may have substitutions in this manner as well.

As described elsewhere the CTLA4 variants generally preserve or enhance binding to one or more of the CTLA4 ligands such as enhanced binding to B7 1 and or B7 2.

The Fc portion of the immunoadhesins of the invention are comprised of the Fc region or some portion of the Fc region of an antibody. Antibodies are immunoglobulins that bind a specific antigen. In most mammals including humans and mice antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies and are responsible for binding the target antigen. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin Ig domains and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins.

Traditional natural antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa and one heavy chain typically having a molecular weight of about 50 70 kDa . Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon and define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. IgG has several subclasses including but not limited to IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including but not limited to IgM1 and IgM2. IgA has several subclasses including but not limited to IgA1 and IgA2. Thus isotype as used herein is meant any of the classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. The known human immunoglobulin isotypes are IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 IgA2 IgM1 IgM2 IgD and IgE. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions although subtler differences may exist in the variable region.

Each of the light and heavy chains are made up of two distinct regions referred to as the variable and constant regions. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VH CH1 CH2 CH3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain heavy chain constant domain 1 heavy chain constant domain 2 and heavy chain constant domain 3 respectively also referred to as VH C 1 C 2 C 3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain constant gamma 1 domain constant gamma 2 domain and constant gamma 3 domain respectively . The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VL CL referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively. The constant regions show less sequence diversity and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. The structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody including the variable and constant regions is referred to herein as a full length antibody . In most mammals including humans and mice the full length antibody of the IgG isotype is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains each pair having one light and one heavy chain each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VL and CL and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VH C 1 C 2 and C 3.

The variable region typically the amino terminal portion of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class.

The carboxy terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. In the IgG subclass of immunoglobulins there are several immunoglobulin domains in the heavy chain referred to as heavy constant CH regions. In the context of IgG antibodies the IgG isotypes each have three CH regions. Accordingly CH domains in the context of IgG are as follows CH1 refers to positions 118 220 according to the EU index as in Kabat. CH2 refers to positions 237 340 according to the EU index as in Kabat and CH3 refers to positions 341 447 according to the EU index as in Kabat.

Another important region of the heavy chain is the hinge region. By hinge or hinge region or antibody hinge region or immunoglobulin hinge region herein is meant the flexible polypeptide comprising the amino acids between the first and second constant domains of an antibody. Structurally the IgG CH1 domain ends at EU position 220 and the IgG CH2 domain begins at residue EU position 237. Thus for IgG the antibody hinge is herein defined to include positions 221 D221 in IgG1 to 236 G236 in IgG1 wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments for example in the context of an Fc region the lower hinge is included with the lower hinge generally referring to positions 226 or 230 to 236.

For all constant region positions discussed in the present invention numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat Kabat et al. 19915th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda entirely incorporated by reference . Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that these conventions consist of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence.

The immunoadhesins of the invention are proteins that are fusions of CTLA4 with the Fc region of an antibody. By Fc or Fc region as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain and in some cases part of the hinge. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA IgD and IgG and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM and the flexible hinge N terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 C 2 and C 3 and the lower hinge region between Cgamma1 C 1 and Cgamma2 C 2 . Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is defined to include residue 230 to the C terminus wherein numbering is based on the EU numbering scheme. Fc may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an Fc polypeptide. By Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant a polypeptide that comprises all or part of an Fc region. Fc polypeptides include antibodies Fc fusions isolated Fc s and Fc fragments.

The Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region Fc comprises Ig domains C 2 and C 3 and the N terminal hinge leading into C 2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs . These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . In humans this protein family includes Fc RI CD64 including isoforms Fc RIa Fc RIb and Fc RIc Fc RII CD32 including isoforms Fc RIIa including allotypes H131 and R131 Fc RIIb including Fc RIIb 1 and Fc RIIb 2 and Fc RIIc and Fc RIII CD16 including isoforms Fc RIIIa including allotypes V158 and F158 and Fc RIIIb including allotypes Fc RIIIb NA1 and Fc RIIIb NA2 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc a membrane spanning region and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells eosinophils mast cells platelets B cells large granular lymphocytes Langerhans cells natural killer NK cells and T cells. Formation of the Fc Fc R complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators B cell activation endocytosis phagocytosis and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis ADCP .

The different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the Fc Rs with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The Fc Rs bind the IgG Fc region with different affinities. The extracellular domains of Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb are 96 identical however Fc RIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore whereas Fc RI Fc RIIa c and Fc RIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex triggered activation characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM Fc RIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors and Fc RIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. Despite these differences in affinities and activities all Fc Rs bind the same region on Fc at the N terminal end of the C 2 domain and the preceding hinge.

An overlapping but separate site on Fc serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc Fc R binding mediates ADCC Fc C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . A site on Fc between the C 2 and C 3 domains mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . This process coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule results in favorable antibody serum half lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. The fidelity of these regions the complement and FcRn protein A binding regions are important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their development.

A key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N linked glycosylation that occurs at N297. This carbohydrate or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. Efficient Fc binding to Fc R and C1q requires this modification and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins.

As is well known in the art immunoglobulin polymorphisms exist in the human population. Gm polymorphism is determined by the IGHG1 IGHG2 and IGHG3 genes which have alleles encoding allotypic antigenic determinants referred to as G1m G2m and G3m allotypes for markers of the human IgG1 IgG2 and IgG3 molecules no Gm allotypes have been found on the gamma 4 chain . Markers may be classified into allotypes and isoallotypes . These are distinguished on different serological bases dependent upon the strong sequence homologies between isotypes. Allotypes are antigenic determinants specified by allelic forms of the Ig genes. Allotypes represent slight differences in the amino acid sequences of heavy or light chains of different individuals. Even a single amino acid difference can give rise to an allotypic determinant although in many cases there are several amino acid substitutions that have occurred. Allotypes are sequence differences between alleles of a subclass whereby the antisera recognize only the allelic differences. An isoallotype is an allele in one isotype which produces an epitope which is shared with a non polymorphic homologous region of one or more other isotypes and because of this the antisera will react with both the relevant allotypes and the relevant homologous isotypes Clark 1997 IgG effector mechanisms Chem Immunol. 65 88 110 Gorman Clark 1990 Semin Immunol 2 6 457 66 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

CTLA4 proteins may be linked to Fc regions via a linker. The term linker is used to denote polypeptides comprising two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art see e.g. Holliger P. et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 Poljak R. J. et al. 1994 Structure 2 1121 1123 . A variety of linkers may find use in some embodiments described herein to covalently link Fc regions to a fusion partner. Linker herein is also referred to as linker sequence spacer tethering sequence or grammatical equivalents thereof. Homo or hetero bifunctional linkers as are well known see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog technical section on cross linkers pages 155 200 incorporated entirely by reference . A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N and C termini of proteins or protein domains linkage via disulfide bonds and linkage via chemical cross linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment the linker is a peptide bond generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues Gly Ser Ala or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. In one embodiment the linker is from about 1 to 20 amino acids in length preferably about 1 to 30 amino acids in length. In one embodiment linkers of 1 to 20 amino acids in length may be used. Useful linkers include glycine serine polymers including for example GS n GSGGS n SEQ ID NO 39 GGGGS n SEQ ID NO 40 and GGGS n SEQ ID NO 41 where n is an integer of at least one glycine alanine polymers alanine serine polymers and other flexible linkers. Alternatively a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers including but not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol may find use as linkers that is may find use as linkers.

Preferred linkers of the invention comprise sequences from an antibody hinge region. Hinge regions sequences from any antibody isotype may be used including for example hinge sequences from IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and or IgG4. Linker sequences may also include any sequence of any length of CL CH1 domain but not all residues of CL CH1 domain for example the first 5 12 amino acid residues of the CL CH1 domains. Linkers can be derived from immunoglobulin heavy chains of any isotype including for example C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 1 C 2 C C and C . Linkers can be derived from immunoglobulin light chain for example C or C . Linker sequences may also be derived from other proteins such as Ig like proteins e.g. TCR FcR KIR hinge region derived sequences and other natural sequences from other proteins.

CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may comprise a variant CTLA4 a variant Fc region or both a variant CTLA4 and a variant Fc region. A variant comprises one or more amino acid modifications relative to a parent CTLA4 Ig protein wherein the amino acid modification s provide one or more optimized properties. By modification herein is meant an alteration in the physical chemical or sequence properties of a protein polypeptide antibody or CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin. By amino acid and amino acid identity as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non natural analogues that may be present at a specific defined position. Thus amino acid as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example homophenylalanine citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. Amino acid also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the R or the S configuration. In the preferred embodiment the amino acids are in the S or L configuration. If non naturally occurring side chains are used non amino acid substituents may be used for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation. An amino acid modification can be an amino acid substitution insertion and or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. By amino acid substitution or substitution herein is meant the replacement of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence with another amino acid. By amino acid insertion or insertion as used herein is meant the addition of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence. By amino acid deletion or deletion as used herein is meant the removal of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence.

A variant disclosed herein differs in amino acid sequence from its parent by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. By parent polypeptide parent protein precursor polypeptide or precursor protein as used herein is meant an unmodified polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide i.e. a WT or native protein or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. By wild type WT or native herein is meant an amino acid sequence or a nucleotide sequence that is found in nature including allelic variations. A WT protein including for example a WT CTLA4 or WT Fc region protein has an amino acid sequence or a nucleotide sequence that has not been intentionally modified. The CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may have more than one amino acid modification as compared to the parent for example from about one to fifty amino acid modifications e.g. from about one to ten amino acid modifications from about one to about five amino acid modifications etc. compared to the parent. Thus the sequences of the variants and those of the parent polypeptide are substantially homologous. For example the variant sequences herein will possess about 80 homology with the parent sequence e.g. at least about 90 homology at least about 95 homology at least about 98 homology at least about 99 homology etc. Modifications disclosed herein also include glycoform modifications. Modifications may be made genetically using molecular biology or may be made enzymatically or chemically.

Variants disclosed herein are defined according to the amino acid modifications that compose them. Thus for example the substitution T51N in CTLA4 refers a CTLA4 variant in which the threonine at position 51 is replaced with asparagine. As another example the substitution N434S in the Fc region refers to an Fc variant in which the asparagine at position 434 is replaced with serine. Likewise M428L N434S defines an Fc variant with the substitutions M428L and N434S relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. The identity of the WT amino acid may be unspecified in which case the aforementioned variant is referred to as 428L 434S. It is noted that the order in which substitutions are provided is arbitrary that is to say that for example 428L 434S is the same Fc variant as 434S 428L For modifications in CTLA4 numbering of positions herein is according to the sequential numbering of the extracellular region of CTLA4 provided in SEQ ID NO 6. Antibody constant region and Fc region positions discussed herein are numbered according to the EU index or EU numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The EU index or EU index as in Kabat or EU numbering scheme refers to the numbering of the EU antibody Edelman et al. 1969 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63 78 85 hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

The goal of the variants herein is to provide one or more optimized properties typically by altering affinity for a target ligand or Fc receptor. Affinity may be enhanced or reduced relative to a parent protein. By greater affinity or improved affinity or enhanced affinity or better affinity than a parent polypeptide as used herein is meant that a variant binds to a ligand or receptor with a significantly higher equilibrium constant of association KA or Ka or lower equilibrium constant of dissociation KD or Kd than the parent polypeptide done under the same conditions for example when the amounts of variant and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same.

For example a CTLA4 variant with improved B7 2 binding affinity may display from about 1.2 1.5 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 fold or more improvement in B7 2 binding affinity compared to the parent CTLA4 polypeptide where B7 2 binding affinity is determined for example by the binding methods disclosed herein including but not limited to Biacore by one skilled in the art.

Accordingly by reduced affinity as compared to a parent polypeptide as used herein is meant that a variant binds a ligand or receptor with significantly lower KA or higher KD than the parent polypeptide. Greater or reduced affinity can also be defined relative to an absolute level of affinity.

The immunoadhesins herein preferably comprise a variant CTLA4. CTLA4 variants may improve binding to B7 1 B7 2 or both B7 1 and B7 2. CTLA4 variants may improve binding selectively to B7 2 relative to B7 1. That is variants may enhance affinity of CTLA4 for B7 2 but either reduce affinity for B7 1 not affect affinity for B7 1 or improve affinity for B7 1 less than the affinity improvement to B7 2. Alternatively variants may improve binding selectively to B7 1 relative to B7 2.

The immunoadhesins herein preferably comprise an Fc variant. The Fc variants disclosed herein may be optimized for improved or reduced binding to Fc receptors or Fc ligands. By Fc receptor or Fc ligand as used herein is meant a molecule preferably a polypeptide from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc Rs Fc Rs Fc Rs FcRn C1q C3 mannan binding lectin mannose receptor staphylococcal protein A streptococcal protein G and viral Fc R. Fc ligands also include Fc receptor homologs FcRH which are a family of Fc receptors that are homologous to the Fc Rs. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc.

CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins described herein can incorporate Fc modifications in the context of any IgG isotype or IgG isotype Fc region including but not limited to human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and or IgG4.

Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. 274Q 276K 300F 339T 356E 358M 384S 392N 397M 422I 435R and 436F. In other embodiments of the invention an IgG1 IgG2 hybrid variant may be constructed by a substitutional means for substituting IgG2 positions in the CH2 and or CH3 region with amino acids from IgG1 at positions where the two isotypes differ. Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. one or more of the following amino acid substations 233E 234L 235L 236G referring to an insertion of a glycine at position 236 and 327A.

As will be appreciated by those in the art the disclosure of individual and combination variants in the Fc region can be independently and optionally combined with any of the CTLA4 variants disclosed herein. That is as described herein CTLA4 variants are individually and optionally selected and or combined within the set of disclosed variants in any combination. Similarly the lists above of suitable Fc domain variants can be individually and optionally combined in any way not only within the Fc region but with any CTLA4 variants. That is a CTLA4 variant may be selected that comprises a number of variants for example A29H T51N L61E K93Q and these variants can be combined with Fc domain variants such as 239D 332E and or 428L 434S. Thus the disclosure of a list of possible individual variants is meant to include any and all possible combinations within the list as well as with other lists of variants for the same or other purposes.

Antibody Fc regions contain carbohydrate at conserved positions in the constant regions of the heavy chain. Each antibody isotype has a distinct variety of N linked carbohydrate structures. Aside from the carbohydrate attached to the heavy chain up to 30 of human IgGs have a glycosylated Fab region. IgG has a single N linked biantennary carbohydrate at Asn297 of the CH2 domain. For IgG from either serum or produced ex vivo in hybridomas or engineered cells the IgG are heterogeneous with respect to the Asn297 linked carbohydrate. For human IgG the core oligosaccharide normally consists of GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc with differing numbers of outer residues.

The carbohydrate moieties of immunoadhesins disclosed herein will be described with reference to commonly used nomenclature for the description of oligosaccharides. A review of carbohydrate chemistry which uses this nomenclature is found in Hubbard et al. 1981 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50 555 583. This nomenclature includes for instance Man which represents mannose GlcNAc which represents 2 N acetylglucosamine Gal which represents galactose Fuc for fucose and Glc which represents glucose. Sialic acids are described by the shorthand notation NeuNAc for 5 N acetylneuraminic acid and NeuNGc for 5 glycolylneuraminic.

The term glycosylation means the attachment of oligosaccharides carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together e.g. from two to about twelve simple sugars linked together to a glycoprotein. The oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of the glycoprotein through either N or O linkages. The oligosaccharides of immunoadhesins disclosed herein occur generally are attached to a CH2 domain of an Fc region as N linked oligosaccharides. N linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to an asparagine residue in a glycoprotein chain. The skilled artisan will recognize that for example each of murine IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b and IgG3 as well as human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgD CH2 domains have a single site for N linked glycosylation at residue 297.

For the purposes herein a mature core carbohydrate structure refers to a processed core carbohydrate structure attached to an Fc region which generally consists of the following carbohydrate structure GlcNAc Fucose GlcNAc Man Man GlcNAc typical of biantennary oligosaccharides. The mature core carbohydrate structure is attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein generally via N linkage to Asn297 of a CH2 domain of the Fc region. A bisecting GlcNAc is a GlcNAc residue attached to the 1 4 mannose of the mature core carbohydrate structure. The bisecting GlcNAc can be enzymatically attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure by a 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III enzyme GnTIII . CHO cells do not normally express GnTIII Stanley et al. 1984 J. Biol. Chem. 261 13370 13378 but may be engineered to do so Umana et al. 1999 Nature Biotech. 17 176 180 .

Described herein are CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins that comprise modified glycoforms or engineered glycoforms. By modified glycoform or engineered glycoform as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to a protein for example an antibody wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent protein. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing Fc R mediated effector function. In one embodiment the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein are modified to control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region.

A variety of methods are well known in the art for generating modified glycoforms Uma a et al. 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 U.S. Ser. No. 12 434 533 all of which are expressly incorporated by reference . These techniques control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region for example by expressing an IgG in various organisms or cell lines engineered or otherwise for example Lec 13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2 0 cells by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway for example FUT8 1 6 fucosyltranserase and or 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII by modifying carbohydrate s after the IgG has been expressed or by expressing antibody in the presence of fucose analogs as enzymatic inhibitors. Other methods for modifying glycoforms of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein include using glycoengineered strains of yeast Li et al. 2006 Nature Biotechnology 24 2 210 215 moss Nechansky et al. 2007 Mol Immunjol 44 7 1826 8 and plants Cox et al. 2006 Nat Biotechnol 24 12 1591 7 . The use of a particular method to generate a modified glycoform is not meant to constrain embodiments to that method. Rather embodiments disclosed herein encompass CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins with modified glycoforms irrespective of how they are produced.

In one embodiment CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein are glycoengineered to alter the level of sialylation. Higher levels of sialylated Fc glycans in CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin G molecules can adversely impact functionality Scallon et al. 2007 Mol Immunol. 44 7 1524 34 and differences in levels of Fc sialylation can result in modified anti inflammatory activity Kaneko et al. 2006 Science 313 670 673 . Because antibodies may acquire anti inflammatory properties upon sialylation of Fc core polysaccharide it may be advantageous to glycoengineer the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein for greater or reduced Fc sialic acid content.

Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide thus for example an immuoglobulin may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively engineered glycoform may refer to the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. In one embodiment a composition disclosed herein comprises a glycosylated CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody e.g. 80 100 90 100 95 100 etc. of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks fucose. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In an alternative embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In yet another embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which contains sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that contains sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In another embodiment the combination of engineered glycoform and amino acid modification provides optimal Fc receptor binding properties to the antibody.

In further embodiments the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein comprise modifications that remove proteolytic degradation sites. These may include for example protease sites that reduce production yields as well as protease sites that degrade the administered protein in vivo. In one embodiment additional modifications are made to remove covalent degradation sites such as deamidation i.e. deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues oxidation and proteolytic degradation sites. Deamidation sites that are particular useful to remove are those that have enhance propensity for deamidation including but not limited to asparaginyl and glutamyl residues followed by glycines NG and QG motifs respectively . In such cases substitution of either residue can significantly reduce the tendency for deamidation. Common oxidation sites include methionine and cysteine residues. Other covalent modifications that can either be introduced or removed include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group. Additional modifications also may include but are not limited to posttranslational modifications such as N linked or O linked glycosylation and phosphorylation.

Modifications may include those that improve expression and or purification yields from hosts or host cells commonly used for production of biologics. These include but are not limited to various mammalian cell lines e.g. CHO yeast cell lines bacterial cell lines and plants. Additional modifications include modifications that remove or reduce the ability of heavy chains to form inter chain disulfide linkages. Additional modifications include modifications that remove or reduce the ability of heavy chains to form intra chain disulfide linkages.

The CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may comprise modifications that include the use of unnatural amino acids incorporated using including but not limited to methods described in Liu Schultz 2010 Annu Rev Biochem 79 413 444 herein expressly incorporated by reference. In some embodiments these modifications enable manipulation of various functional biophysical immunological or manufacturing properties discussed above. In additional embodiments these modifications enable additional chemical modification for other purposes.

Other modifications are contemplated herein. For example the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. Additional amino acid modifications may be made to enable specific or non specific chemical or posttranslational modification of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins. Such modifications include but are not limited to PEGylation and glycosylation. Specific substitutions that can be utilized to enable PEGylation include but are not limited to introduction of novel cysteine residues or unnatural amino acids such that efficient and specific coupling chemistries can be used to attach a PEG or otherwise polymeric moiety. Introduction of specific glycosylation sites can be achieved by introducing novel N X T S sequences into the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein.

Modifications to reduce immunogenicity may include modifications that reduce binding of processed peptides derived from the parent sequence to MHC proteins. For example amino acid modifications would be engineered such that there are no or a minimal number of immune epitopes that are predicted to bind with high affinity to any prevalent MHC alleles. Several methods of identifying MHC binding epitopes in protein sequences are known in the art and may be used to score epitopes in an antibody disclosed herein.

Covalent modifications are included within the scope of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein and are generally but not always done post translationally. For example several types of covalent modifications can be introduced into the molecule by reacting specific amino acid residues with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues. In some embodiments the covalent modification of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein comprises the addition of one or more labels. The term labeling group means any detectable label. In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used in generating CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein.

In one embodiment the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein are fusion proteins sometimes referred to herein as conjugates . The fusion partner or conjugate partner can be proteinaceous or non proteinaceous the latter generally being generated using functional groups on the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin and on the conjugate partner. Conjugate and fusion partners may be any molecule including small molecule chemical compounds and polypeptides. For example a variety of conjugates and methods are described in Trail et al. 1999 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11 584 588 incorporated entirely by reference. Possible conjugate partners include but are not limited to cytokines cytotoxic agents toxins radioisotopes chemotherapeutic agent anti angiogenic agents a tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutically active agents. In some embodiments conjugate partners may be thought of more as payloads that is to say that the goal of a conjugate is targeted delivery of the conjugate partner to a targeted cell for example a cancer cell or immune cell by the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin. Thus for example the conjugation of a toxin to an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin targets the delivery of said toxin to cells expressing the target antigen. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art in reality the concepts and definitions of fusion and conjugate are overlapping. The designation of a fusion or conjugate is not meant to constrain it to any particular embodiment disclosed herein. Rather these terms are used loosely to convey the broad concept that any CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin disclosed herein may be linked genetically chemically or otherwise to one or more polypeptides or molecules to provide some desirable property.

Also disclosed herein are methods for producing and experimentally testing CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins. The disclosed methods are not meant to constrain embodiments to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be produced and experimentally tested to obtain CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins. General methods for antibody and protein molecular biology expression purification and screening are described in Antibody Engineering edited by Kontermann Dubel Springer Heidelberg 2001 and Hayhurst Georgiou 2001 Curr Opin Chem Biol 5 683 689 Maynard Georgiou 2000 Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339 76 

In one embodiment disclosed herein nucleic acids are created that encode the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins and that may then be cloned into host cells expressed and assayed if desired. Thus nucleic acids and particularly DNA may be made that encode each protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well known procedures. For example a variety of methods that may find use in generating CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein are described in Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 2001 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons both incorporated entirely by reference. There are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate DNA encoding CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods PCR based method and methods which use variations of PCR ligase chain reaction based methods pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling error prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations classical site directed mutagenesis methods cassette mutagenesis and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly mutagenesis vector subcloning and the like and such commercial products find use in for generating nucleic acids that encode CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins.

The CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin proteins disclosed herein may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid e.g. an expression vector containing nucleic acid encoding the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used including but not limited to mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and plant cells. For example a variety of cell lines that may find use in generating CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein are described in the ATCC cell line catalog available from the American Type Culture Collection.

In one embodiment the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are expressed in mammalian expression systems including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used e.g. human mouse rat hamster and primate cells. Suitable cells also include known research cells including but not limited to Jurkat T cells NIH3T3 CHO BHK COS HEK293 PER C.6 HeLa Sp2 0 NS0 cells and variants thereof. In an alternate embodiment library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art and include and . In alternate embodiments CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are produced in insect cells e.g. Sf21 Sf9 Bti Tn5b1 4 or yeast cells e.g. etc . In an alternate embodiment CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic e.g. and eukaryotic e.g. wheat germ rabbit reticulocytes cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example as appreciated by those skilled in the art in vitro translation is required for some display technologies for example ribosome display. In addition the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be produced by chemical synthesis methods. Also transgenic expression systems both animal e.g. cow sheep or goat milk embryonated hen s eggs whole insect larvae etc. and plant e.g. corn tobacco duckweed etc. 

The nucleic acids that encode the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self replicating extra chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in generating CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art a variety of expression vectors are available commercially or otherwise that may find use for expressing CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein.

Expression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences selectable markers any fusion partners and or additional elements. By operably linked herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences ribosomal binding sites transcriptional start and stop sequences translational start and stop sequences and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.

CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein purification screening display and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids typically less than ten although longer linkers may also be used. Typically linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS SEQ ID NO 40 . A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media or into the periplasmic space located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags His tags for example H6 and H10 or other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography IMAC systems e.g. Ni 2 affinity columns GST fusions MBP fusions Strep tag the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies for example c myc tags flag tags and the like . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art such tags may be useful for purification for screening or both. For example an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin may be purified using a His tag by immobilizing it to a Ni 2 affinity column and then after purification the same His tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni 2 coated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay as described below . A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins see below . Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well known in the art.

In one embodiment CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Purification may be particularly useful in the invention for separating heterodimeric heavy chain species from homodimeric heavy chain species as described herein. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques including ion exchange hydrophobic interaction affinity sizing or gel filtration and reversed phase carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic isoelectric focusing immunological precipitation dialysis and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques in conjunction with protein concentration are also useful. As is well known in the art a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies and these proteins can find use for purification of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein. For example the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies as of course does the antibody s target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed Ni 2 affinity chromatography if a His tag is employed or immobilized anti flag antibody if a flag tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques see e.g. incorporated entirely by reference Protein Purification Principles and Practice 3rd Ed. Scopes Springer Verlag NY 1994 incorporated entirely by reference. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment if the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are secreted screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins.

CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be tested experimentally using a variety of in vitro methods including but not limited to those that use binding assays cell based assays and selection technologies. Automation and high throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By labeled herein is meant that the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein have one or more elements isotopes or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general labels fall into three classes a immune labels which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody b isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes and c small molecule labels which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.

In one embodiment the functional and or biophysical properties of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Particularly relevant for the present invention the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be tested for their affinity for one or more antigens. Properties that may be screened include but are not limited to stability solubility and affinity for Fc ligands for example Fc Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin. In one embodiment the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the target antigen. In an alternate embodiment the screen is an assay for binding of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins to an Fc ligand including but are not limited to the family of Fc Rs the neonatal receptor FcRn the complement protein C1q and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism. In one embodiment Fc ligands are from humans mice rats rabbits and or monkeys. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art including but not limited to FRET Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer and BRET Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer based assays AlphaScreen Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Scintillation Proximity Assay ELISA Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay SPR Surface Plasmon Resonance also known as BIACORE isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry gel electrophoresis and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels.

The biophysical properties of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins for example stability and solubility may be tested using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be unfolded using chemical denaturant heat or pH and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy absorbance spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy calorimetry and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use for characterizing the biophysical properties of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein include gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing capillary electrophoresis chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide mapping oligosaccharide mapping mass spectrometry ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry analytical ultra centrifugation dynamic light scattering proteolysis and cross linking turbidity measurement filter retardation assays immunological assays fluorescent dye binding assays protein staining assays microscopy and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment stability and or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition for example elevated temperature low pH or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable soluble and or well folded structured protein the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example a solution comprising an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin s stability and solubility.

In one embodiment CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may be tested using one or more cell based or in vitro assays. For such assays CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins purified or unpurified are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins described herein. These assays are typically but not always based on the biology of the ability of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin to bind to the target antigen and mediate some biochemical event for example effector functions like cellular lysis phagocytosis ligand receptor binding inhibition inhibition of growth and or proliferation inhibition of calcium release and or signaling apoptosis and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin for example cell survival cell death cellular phagocytosis cell lysis change in cellular morphology or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example such assays may measure the ability of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins to elicit cell killing for example ADCC ADCP and CDC. Assays that measure cellular killing that is mediated by co engagement of antigens are particularly relevant for the invention. For some assays additional cells or components that is in addition to the target cells may need to be added for example serum complement or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes PBMCs NK cells macrophages T cells and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism e.g. humans mice rat rabbit and monkey. Crosslinked or monomeric antibodies may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody s target antigen or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art and include the use of dyes fluorophores immunochemical cytochemical and radioactive reagents. For example caspase assays or annexin flourconjugates may enable apoptosis to be measured and uptake or release of radioactive substrates e.g. Chromium 51 release assays or the metabolic reduction of fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth proliferation or activation to be monitored. In one embodiment the DELFIA EuTDA based cytotoxicity assay Perkin Elmer Mass. is used. Alternatively dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell based assays. In this case response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated or down regulated for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured or alternatively readout may be via a luciferase or GFP reporter construct. Cell based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed. Alternatively cell based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins.

The biological properties of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be characterized in cell tissue and whole organism experiments.

As shown herein in general testing of binding and associated affinities of the variant CTLA4 domains of the immunoadhesins of the invention is done using binding assays as outlined in the examples As described above affinity may be described as being enhanced when the KA of a variant polypeptide relative to parent polypeptide is significantly higher or the KD of a variant polypeptide is significantly lower relative to a parent polypeptide. When expressed in terms of a ratio for example KA variant polypeptide KA parent polypeptide or KD parent polypeptide KD variant polypeptide a significant increase in affinity is witnessed for example when one and or both of these ratios is about 1.2 1.5 2.0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 50 100 250 500 1000 or more.

As is known in the art drugs are often tested in animals including but not limited to mice rats rabbits dogs cats pigs and monkeys in order to measure a drug s efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model or to measure a drug s pharmacokinetics toxicity and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. With respect to the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein a particular challenge arises when using animal models to evaluate the potential for in human efficacy of candidate polypeptides this is due at least in part to the fact that the Fc domains of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins that have a specific effect on the affinity for a human Fc receptor may not have a similar affinity effect with the orthologous animal receptor. These problems can be further exacerbated by the inevitable ambiguities associated with correct assignment of true orthologues Mechetina et al. 2002 Immunogenetics 54 463 468 incorporated entirely by reference and the fact that some orthologues simply do not exist in the animal. Therapeutics are often tested in mice including but not limited to nude mice Rag deficient mice SCID mice xenograft mice and transgenic mice including knockins and knockouts . Therapeutic CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins herein can be tested in mouse strains NZB NOD BXSB MRL Ipr K BxN and transgenics including knockins and knockouts . Such mice can develop various autoimmune conditions that resemble human organ specific systemic autoimmune or inflammatory disease pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and rheumatoid arthritis RA . For example an CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin disclosed herein intended for autoimmune diseases may be tested in such mouse models by treating the mice to determine the ability of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin to reduce or inhibit the development of the disease pathology. Because of the incompatibility between the mouse and human Fc receptor system an alternative approach is to use a murine SCID model in which immune deficient mice are engrafted with human PBLs or PBMCs huPBL SCID huPBMC SCID providing a semi functional human immune system with human effector cells and Fc receptors. Other organisms e.g. mammals may also be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models and thus may be used to test the efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics or other property of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein. Tests of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics and or other clinical properties.

In some embodiments CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be assessed for efficacy in clinically relevant animal models of various human diseases. In many cases relevant models include various transgenic animals for specific antigens and receptors.

In one embodiment the testing of CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins may include study of efficacy in primates e.g. cynomolgus monkey model to facilitate the evaluation of depletion of specific target cells harboring the target antigen. Additional primate models include but are not limited to use of the rhesus monkey to assess CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins in therapeutic studies of autoimmune transplantation and cancer.

Toxicity studies are performed to determine drug related effects that cannot be evaluated in standard pharmacology profiles or occur only after repeated administration of the agent. Most toxicity tests are performed in two species a rodent and a non rodent to ensure that any unexpected adverse effects are not overlooked before new therapeutic entities are introduced into man. In general these models may measure a variety of toxicities including genotoxicity chronic toxicity immunogenicity reproductive developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity. Included within the aforementioned parameters are standard measurement of food consumption bodyweight antibody formation clinical chemistry and macro and microscopic examination of standard organs tissues e.g. cardiotoxicity . Additional parameters of measurement are injection site trauma and the measurement of neutralizing antibodies if any. Traditionally monoclonal antibody therapeutics naked or conjugated are evaluated for cross reactivity with normal tissues immunogenicity antibody production conjugate or linker toxicity and bystander toxicity of radiolabelled species. Nonetheless such studies may have to be individualized to address specific concerns and following the guidance set by ICH S6 Safety studies for biotechnological products also noted above . As such the general principles are that the products are sufficiently well characterized impurities contaminants have been removed that the test material is comparable throughout development that GLP compliance is maintained.

The pharmacokinetics PK of the CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesins disclosed herein may be studied in a variety of animal systems with the most relevant being non human primates such as the cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys. Single or repeated i.v. s.c. administrations over a dose range of 6000 fold 0.05 300 mg kg can be evaluated for half life days to weeks using plasma concentration and clearance. Volume of distribution at a steady state and level of systemic absorbance can also be measured. Examples of such parameters of measurement generally include maximum observed plasma concentration Cmax the time to reach Cmax Tmax the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity AUC 0 inf and apparent elimination half life T . Additional measured parameters could include compartmental analysis of concentration time data obtained following i.v. administration and bioavailability.

Based on the results of the single substitution screen a library of combination variants and additional single substitution variants was designed. The new variants are listed in Tables 4 and 5. Variants were constructed expressed and purified as described above. Binding to B7 targets was measured as described above and fitted kinetic rate constants and affinities are provided in Table 4 B7 1 and Table 5 B7 2 .

A plot of the CD80 and CD86 KD for all of the variants compared to abatacept and belatacept is shown in . A number of the combination variants bound more tightly to both B7 1 CD80 and B7 2 CD86 relative to the abatacept parent CTLA4 Ig providing up to 3.6 fold binding improvement to B7 1 and up to 19.2 fold binding improvement to B7 2. The best triple substitution variant for B7 2 binding was T51N L61E K93Q referred to as NEQ which improved B7 2 affinity from 437 pM to 40 pM and which improved B7 1 affinity from 59 pM to 36 pM. The best quadruple substitution variant for B7 2 binding was A29H T51N L61E K93Q referred to as HNEQ which improved B7 2 affinity from 437 pM to 23 pM and which improved B7 1 affinity from 59 pM to 16 pM. A plot of the sensorgrams from the highest CTLA4 Ig concentration for the HNEQ variant compared to abatacept and belatacept is shown in . Amino acid sequences of these CTLA4 variant and CTLA4 Ig variant proteins are provided in .

The NEQ and HNEQ variant CTLA4 Ig proteins were tested in a cell based assay for their capacity to inhibit T cell proliferation. Abatacept belatacept and an anti RSV IgG1 antibody with no specificity for B7 1 or B7 2 negative control were run as controls. In this assay T cell activation and proliferation were stimulated using the anti CD3 antibody OKT3 and recombinant B7 2 Fc fusion R D Systems . U shape tissues culture plates were coated with 2 ug ml CD86 Fc and 0.5 ug ml anti OKT3 in PBS at 4 C. overnight. Plates were washed 3 with PBS. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were purified from leukapheresis of anonymous healthy volunteers HemaCare VanNuys Calif. using Ficoll Paque Plus density gradients Amersham Biosciences Newark N.J. . T cells were isolated from PBMC using an EasySep Human T Cell Enrichment Kit StemCell Technologies and labeled T cells with CSFE 10 uM . CTLA4 Ig protein variants and controls were added at 4 fold dilutions over 8 concentrations with the highest concentration at 50 ug ml. Samples were run in duplicate. 500 000 T cells were added to the coated plate and incubated for 4 days at 37 C. Control conditions were carried out with cells on CD86 Fc OKT3 coated wells and cells only without coating . After 4 days culture samples were analyzed for FITC staining CSFE using a FACSCanto2 . The data in show that the tested CTLA4 Ig variants T51N L61E K93Q and A29H T51N L61E K93Q are superior to the parent CTLA4 Ig abatacept consistent with their improved B7 1 and B7 2 affinities. Moreover both T51N L61E K93Q and A29H T51N L61E K93Q variant showed greater inhibitory activity relative to belatacept consistent with their greater B7 2 affinity.

The Fc region of the CTLA4 Ig proteins were engineered to enhance affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn with the goal of improving in vivo serum half life. Fc variants that improve FcRn binding and may provide enhanced pharmacokinetic properties include but are not limited to substitutions at positions 259 307 308 311 378 426 428 434 and 436 including but not limited to for example 259I 307Q 308F 311I 311V 378V 378T 426V 428L 434S 434H 434F 434Y 434M 436I and 436V U.S. Ser.

Substitutions M428L and N434S that provide enhanced FcRn affinity and extended half life were engineered into the Fc region of abatacept CTLA4 Ig ab CTLA4 Ig G2 belatacept and Ig G2 ELLG versions of the CTLA4 HNEQ and CTLA4 NEQ variants. Amino acid sequences of these CTLA4 Ig variant proteins are provided in .

CTLA4 Ig variant proteins were constructed expressed and purified as described above. Affinity of these variants to FcRn at pH 6.0 was measured using Biacore with an antigen mediated immunoadhesin capture human FcRn analyte format using a Biacore 3000 instrument Biacore . B7 1 and B7 2 were immobilized on CM5 chip to a density of 6500 and 8400 RUs respectively using standard amine coupling method. Ligands were diluted in pH 4.0 acetate buffer to 200 nM each. Surface was activated for 4 min with full strength 1 Ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC N hydroxysulfosuccinimide Sulfo NHS followed by injection of B7 1 or B7 2 Fc fusion ligand R D Systems for 15 min at 2 ul min. Finally the surface was blocked with ethanolamine. Capture of CTLA4 Ig proteins was carried out in pH 6.0 phosphate buffer at either 20 nM WT IgG1 Fc or 10 nM M428L N434S variant Fc for 2 minutes to achieve RUs of 1500 or 700 respectively. Then human FcRn analyte solutions at concentrations 500 250 and 125 nM were injected at indicated concs followed by regeneration of B7 surface with pH 4.0 acetate 500 mM NaCl buffer before the next cycle. Due to Fc fusion present on B7 there was a high background of hFcRn binding directly to the surface therefore a concentration series of hFcRn was injected on non immobilized empty surface to manually subtract this background during Biaevaluation analysis. Following background drift subtraction and axis zeroing sensograms were fit globally to a 1 1 Langmuir binding model using the BIAevaluation software Biacore 

Representative sensorgrams for binding of abatacept CTLA4 Ig ab and the Fc engineered version CTLA4 Ig ab LS LS 428L 434S are shown in . Fitted affinities for binding to FcRn by abatacept CTLA4 Ig ab and CTLA4 Ig G2 along with Fc engineered versions CTLA4 Ig ab LS and CTLA4 Ig G2 LS are provided in Table 6 and plotted in . The results demonstrate the enhanced affinity for FcRn of the Fc engineered versions of the CTLA4 Ig proteins and thus the potential of the Fc variant versions for longer half life in vivo.

Select CTLA4 Ig variants with enhanced binding to FcRn were tested for their T cell inhibitory activity. CTLA4 Ig proteins were tested in the cell based assay described above where T cell proliferation was stimulated using the anti CD3 antibody and B7 2 Fc fusion. The data in show the potent and superior inhibitory activity of the B7 affinity enhanced CTLA4 variants T51N L61E K93Q and A29H T51N L61E K93Q coupled with the FcRn affinity enhancing Fc variants M428L N434S .

The T cell inhibitory activities of the CTLA4 Ig variants were further measured by testing them in a mixed lymphocyte reaction also known as a mixed leukocyte reaction or MLR . The MLR is an in vitro method for assaying T helper TH cell proliferation and for generating a population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs . When allogeneic different MHC haplotype lymphocytes are cultured together TH cell populations expand followed by expansion of a CTL population. MHC TCR and B7 CD28 co stimulatory pathways are critical to allogeneic reaction. Interleukin 2 IL 2 secretion was used to monitor T cell activation. In two separate experiments two different sets of human PBMCs were purified from leukapheresis of two different anonymous healthy volunteers HemaCare VanNuys Calif. using Ficoll Paque Plus density gradients Amersham Biosciences Newark N.J. . PBMCs were mixed at 1.2 10E6 per well each with 300 ul RPMI1640 10 FBS. In one of the two experiments PBMCs from donors 2336 and 3070 were mixed in the other experiment PBMCs from donors 3070 and 3995 were mixed. CTLA4 Ig proteins and anti RSV IgG1 negative controls were prepared in a 10 point 4 dilution series and added at the indicated final concentrations to the mixed PBMCs. PBMCs alone separately were also run as controls. Plates were incubated for 6 days. Supernatant was collected and concentration of IL 2 was measured using an IL 2 ELISA LegendMax Kit BioLegend . The results of the assays are provided in .

The data in support the potent inhibitory activity of the CTLA4 Ig variants as well as their superiority to Orencia abatacept . Surprisingly the NEQ variant outperformed the HNEQ variant despite the greater affinity of the HNEQ variant for both B7 1 and B7 2 Tables 4 and 5 . The HNEQ variant improves B7 1 affinity 3.6 fold and B7 2 affinity 19.2 fold relative to abatacept while the NEQ variant improves B7 1 affinity 1.6 fold and B7 2 affinity 10.8 fold relative to abatacept. The greater T cell inhibitory activity of the NEQ variant may reflect the different biological roles of B7 1 and B7 2 in immune response. Recent work has demonstrated that B7 2 is the dominant ligand of CD28 while B7 1 is the dominant ligand of CTLA4 and further that B7 2 is unable recruit CTLA 4 to the immune synapse Collins et al. 2002 Immunity 17 201 210 Jansson et al. 2005 J Immunol 175 1575 1585 . Because of the role of endogenous CTLA4 in downregulating T cells Alegre et al. 2001 Nat Rev Immunol 1 220 8 as well as its role in regulatory T cell Treg mediated suppression of immune response Sakaguchi et al. 2009 International Immunology 21 10 1105 1111 increased affinity for B7 1 which preferentially engages endogenous CTLA4 may inhibit the natural inhibitor thus promoting T cell activation. In this light for therapeutic purposes B7 2 may be the more important ligand to inhibit and accordingly the optimal variant for CTLA4 optimization may be selective enhancement in affinity to B7 2 relative to B7 1. Substitutions that selectively improve affinity to B7 2 relative to B7 1 include for example A29H A29K T51N L61E and Y103Q. It is noted that for experimental purposes testing this selectivity hypothesis may benefit from variants that provide the opposite selectivity i.e. improved binding to B7 1 relative to B7 2 including for example K93V L61Q and L104H. Overall the results indicate that the NEQ combination variant T51N L61E K93Q is the optimal variant with regard to selectivity providing 10.8 fold affinity enhancement to B7 2 but only marginally 1.6 fold greater binding to B7 1. This affinity and selectivity profile is superior to belatacept which improves affinity only 6.5 7 fold to B7 2 and 2.3 fold to B7 1 Tables 2 5 .

An in vivo experiment in mice was carried out to test the activity of the engineered CTLA4 Ig variants. The capacity of the CTLA4 Ig proteins to inhibit a human immune response to tetanus was carried out in severe combined immunodeficiency SCID mice engrafted with human peripheral blood leukocytes PBLs . SCID mice were chosen as the animal model for this study as these mice are immunocompromised and will accept engraftment of human PBMC. CTLA4 Ig proteins for in vivo studies were expressed in CHO cells Biotechnology Research Institute National Research Council Canada and purified as described above.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were obtained from a leukopack collected from a random donor Hemacare Van Nuys Calif. . PBMCs were purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation Ficoll Paque Plus GE Healthcare resuspended in RPMI 1640 Mediatech and injected intraperitoneally i.p. at a dose of 3 10cells. One day prior to PBMC injection mice were injected i.p. with 100 ul of anti asialo GM Wako Richmond Va. to deplete murine NK cells. The next day mice were injected i.p. with 3 107 PBMC in a 0.5 ml volume. A total of approximately 70 mice were injected. The day of cell injection was defined as study day 0. All animals were injected with PBMC on the same day.

After PBMC injection mice were randomly assigned to groups and weighed. On day 7 post PBMC injection blood was collected from all mice via retro orbital sinus plexus OSP puncture for determination of human IgG levels hIgG ELISA ZeptoMetrix Buffalo N.Y. On the same day after the blood collection day 7 mice were injected i.p. 1 mg kg test article or PBS as a negative control. Mice continued to receive injections every 3 or 4 days throughout the study. Test articles were injected on a mg kg basis using the most recent body weight measurement. On day 9 mice were injected i.p. with 15 g tetanus toxoid List Biological Labs Campbell Calif. catalog 191B or with PBS. On day 21 12 days post antigen vaccination blood was collected from all mice for determination of human IgG and anti tetanus IgG.

Blood samples 25 50 ul were collected at days 7 and 21 post PBMC engraftment using Retro orbital sinus plexus OSP using topical proparacaine anesthetic and inhalant isoflurane . Blood samples were transferred to serum separator tubes allowed to sit for 30 mins 1 hour to allow the blood to clot and then spun in a centrifuge 3500 rpm for 30 mins . The resulting serum was transferred to polypropylene tubes labeled with study number animal number date collection timepoint. Serum samples were stored at 20 C. Serum concentration of anti tetanus antibody anti TT IgG was measured using a standard anti tetanus ELISA kit IBL America .

The results in demonstrate the activity of the affinity enhanced NEQ variant CTLA4 Ig immunoadhesin relative to PBS tetanus alone. Furthermore the data show that the NEQ variant had more potent inhibitory activity than the parent CTLA4 Ig abatcept. These data support the use of the CTLA4 Ig variants described herein for treating immune related disorders.
