This invention relates generally to inflators for use in inflating inflatable restraint airbag cushions such as used to provide impact protection to occupants of motor vehicles. More particularly the invention relates to inflators having or containing multiple initiators and more specifically to duplex firing inflators.

It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion or bag e.g. an airbag that is inflated or expanded with gas when the vehicle encounters sudden deceleration such as in a collision. In such systems the airbag cushion is normally housed in an uninflated and folded condition to minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the system the cushion begins being inflated in a matter of no more than a few milliseconds with gas produced or supplied by a device commonly referred to as an inflator. 

Various types of inflator devices have been disclosed in the art for the inflation of an airbag such as used in inflatable restraint systems. One type of known inflator device derives inflation gas from a combustible pyrotechnic gas generating material which upon ignition generates a quantity of gas sufficient to inflate the airbag.

Inflatable safety restraint installations typically employ an inflator device to produce inflation gas for inflating a vehicle occupant restraint airbag cushion in the event of a collision. Such inflator devices often include a gas generant material stored within the inflator device housing and an initiator in combination with the housing that actuates the gas generant material. The initiator typically includes a reactive charge in combination with electrical connectors. A signal sent through the electrical connector s actuates the reactive charge which produces reaction products that actuate the gas generant material.

In view of possibly varying operating conditions and in turn possibly varying desired performance characteristics inflatable safety restraint technology has lead to the development of what has been termed adaptive or Smart inflator devices and corresponding inflatable restraint systems. With an adaptive inflator device output parameters such as one or more of the quantity supply and rate of supply of inflation gas for example can be selectively and appropriately varied dependent on selected operating conditions such as one or more of ambient temperature occupant presence seat belt usage and rate of deceleration of the motor vehicle for example.

Pyrotechnic inflators typically may have one or more chambers containing gas generant. Adaptive pyrotechnic inflators having gas generant material in two chambers which are independently ignited via respective initiators or igniters have been referred to as dual stage inflators. In practice each such gas generant material containing chamber is oftentimes referred to as a combustion chamber as the gas generant material therein contained is burned or otherwise reacted to produce or form gas such as may be used to inflate an associated inflatable restraint airbag cushion.

Dual stage inflators may have several contemplated actuation or firing scenarios. In a first such scenario only the gas generant material in a first or primary chamber and associate initiator device is actuated whereby a fixed quantity of inflation gas is produced thereby. In a second possible scenario the first or primary initiator is first actuated whereby gas generant material in a first chamber is first reacted to start to produce or form inflation gas and after a predetermined or preselected delay a secondary initiator is then actuated whereby gas generant material in the second chamber is reacted to also produce or form inflation gas. In a third possible scenario both the primary and the secondary initiators are actuated whereby a gas generant material in a first chamber and a gas generant material in a second chamber are actuated simultaneously to produce or form inflation gas from the gas generant material in each of the chambers.

As will be appreciated through the selection and use of an appropriate such actuation or firing scenario inflator output parameters such as one or more of the quantity supply and rate of supply of inflation gas for example can be selectively and appropriately varied dependent on selected operating conditions such as one or more of ambient temperature occupant presence seat belt usage and rate of deceleration of the motor vehicle for example.

Previous adaptive or dual stage inflator devices include inflator devices such as described and or claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 950 693 issued 31 May 2011 to Jackson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 597 353 issued 6 Oct. 2009 to Smith et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 347 448 issued 25 Mar. 2008 to Smith et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 189 927 issued 20 Feb. 2001 to Mossi et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 032 979 issued 7 Mar. 2000 to Mossi et al. the disclosures of each which are hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof including but not limited to any portions which may specifically appear herein.

Current state of the art automotive airbag technology commonly employs dual stage inflators smart inflators to achieve the necessary performance requirements associated with instrument panel IP integrity and out of position OOP occupants. Typically inherent with this technology are some features that are not desirable in the current automotive market. For example the inflator devices and associated component hardware associated with such applications are commonly of a greater size and weight than optimally desired. Also such inflator devices oftentimes suffer due to increased design complexity as well as the increased costs of the additional components and associated manufacturing processes.

As a point of reference shows a current design dual stage inflator assembly generally designated by the reference numeral and shown in a static state or condition e.g. prior to actuation.

The inflator assembly includes a housing construction having a generally cylindrical external outline and such as formed of two structural components i.e. a lower shell or base portion and an upper shell or diffuser cap portion . The diffuser cap portion is in the general form of an inverted bowl and includes a top wall and a cylindrical sidewall which includes a plurality of spaced preferably generally uniformly spaced gas exit ports .

The base portion includes first and second mounting openings designated by the reference numerals and respectively. The base portion also includes a peripheral bracket that extends radially outward from the housing and such as may serve to form an interface attachment which is used to attach the inflator assembly to a vehicle.

The housing is configured to define a central first chamber . The first chamber contains or houses a supply of a first gas generant material such as typically in the form of a pyrotechnic not here shown to facilitate illustration and comprehension.

Within the first chamber such as in surrounding relation with the first gas generant material therein contained is a filter assembly . Such a filter assembly may include one or more of a combustion screen or filter such as formed of multiple layers or wraps of a metal screen a filter damper pad or the like.

The inflator assembly also includes a retainer such as may serve as a construction expedient to retain the inflator assembly components in proper relative arrangement and prevent undesired flow passage through the assembly.

A first igniter assembly generally designated by the reference numeral is mounted to the housing in a location within the first chamber via the first mounting opening . The first igniter assembly may take the form of a known pyrotechnic initiator device such as includes as is known in the art an igniter or ignition booster cup wherein is housed a canister such as contains an igniter material not here shown to facilitate illustration and comprehension. The first igniter assembly also includes a first igniter device or squib in conjunction with an initiator pyrotechnic output composition not shown a pyrotechnic output composition containment cup and electrical isolation sleeve such as made of metal and a squib adapter or holder whereby the igniter assembly is mounted to or mated with the housing . As shown the igniter cup can take the form of a generally concave member with a cap and a cylindrical sidewall forming an interior . The igniter cup can be formed of a gas impermeable material such as metal with the cylindrical sidewall including a plurality of positioned and spaced gas exit orifices not shown that are normally e.g. when the inflator is in a static or prior to actuation state covered and the passage of material therethrough prevented by means of a pressure sensitive covering or barrier not shown such as by means of an adhesive backed foil seal wrap or the like as is well known in the art. As is known such covering can be selected to open or rupture upon the application of a predetermined pressure thereagainst from the interior of the igniter cup .

When actuated the squib discharges or otherwise results in the rupture or opening of the ignition material canister and in turn ignition of the igniter material normally contained and subsequently the gas generant material contained within the first chamber .

In practice the igniter assembly is connected or joined to the housing such as by welding the holder to the base portion at the mounting opening .

The first chamber also houses or contains a second chamber . The second chamber includes a generant cup a lid closure a second igniter device or squib in conjunction with an initiator pyrotechnic output composition not shown a pyrotechnic output composition containment cup and electrical isolation sleeve such as made of metal and a second squib adapter or holder whereby the second igniter device and the associated second chamber are mounted or mated with the housing such as via the second mounting opening .

The generant cup and the lid closure cooperate to form a generant cup interior wherein is desirably placed a selected quantity of a second gas generant material such as typically in the form of a pyrotechnic as described above and not here shown to facilitate illustration and comprehension. The second gas generant material may typically be in the form of a pyrotechnic material and may be either the same or different in composition shape size or form as compared to the first gas generant material.

The generant cup and the lid closure further desirably cooperate and function in a manner such as to permit the combustion products formed by reaction of the gas generant material contained within the second chamber when properly and desirably actuated to pass from the second chamber out into the first chamber through the filter assembly and the exit ports out from the inflator assembly and into an associated airbag cushion not shown .

As will be appreciated there is a need and demand for improved inflator devices and component s thereof and associated methods of manufacture and operation of increased simplicity and reliability of operation and design. In particular there is a need and demand for inflator devices particularly inflator devices with multiple firing initiators and component s thereof and associated methods of manufacture and operation that provide or result in specifically desired inflation performance scenarios in a less costly and or more efficient manner e.g. one or more of reduced size weight and or complexity of manufacture and or operation .

In accordance with one aspect there is provided a structural component for a duplex firing inflator. The component includes a molded element that contains a duplex firing initiator assembly. The duplex firing initiator assembly includes a primary initiator operatively associated with a primary pyrotechnic output composition and a secondary initiator operatively associated with a secondary pyrotechnic output composition. The component further includes a single connector in electrical operative association with the primary and the secondary initiators.

According to further specific particular embodiments the component can for example additionally include contain or otherwise form one or more of the following 

an ignition booster cup in initiating discharge receiving communication with the primary pyrotechnic output composition 

a seal for selective isolation of contents of the ignition booster cup from the primary pyrotechnic output composition 

a breakout web at a discreet gas exit opening to separate contents of the ignition booster cup from gas generant contained with an associated inflator device 

a second stage gas generant cup for containing a second stage gas generant material ignitable by output from the secondary pyrotechnic output composition upon actuation thereof 

the primary initiator and the secondary initiator are in horizontal firing placement within the component and

the primary initiator and the secondary initiator are in vertical firing placement within the component.

In another aspect the invention provides a dual stage duplex firing inflator device. In accordance with one embodiment such dual stage duplex firing inflator device includes a housing having at least one gas exit port and a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. The inflator device further includes a structural component comprising a molded element containing a duplex firing initiator assembly including a primary initiator operatively associated with a primary pyrotechnic output composition and a secondary initiator operatively associated with a secondary pyrotechnic output composition. The structural component includes a single connector in electrical operative association with the primary and the secondary initiators. The structural component further includes at least one cavity or void to form a mold material runner to capture or lock the component to an associated inflator assembly housing element.

As used herein references to a component or components as being or forming a structural component are to be understood to refer to such component forming a pressure containing and bearing surface of an inflator device.

Other objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended claims and drawings.

As described in great detail below the present invention provides an improved design and component for an inflator device. More specifically the invention provides a component such as serves as a structural element or component for a duplex firing inflator.

The diffuser cap portion is in the general form of an inverted bowl and includes a top wall and a cylindrical sidewall which includes a plurality of spaced preferably generally uniformly spaced gas exit ports .

As will be described in greater detail below the inflator device differs perhaps most significantly from the above described inflator device in that the base portion of the inflator device advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies rather than multiple mounting openings e.g. mounting opening and shown in inflator device .

The base portion may also as shown include a peripheral bracket such as extends radially outward such as may serve to form an interface attachment which is used to attach the inflator assembly to a vehicle.

The housing is configured to define a central first chamber . The first chamber contains or houses a supply of a first gas generant material such as typically in the form of a pyrotechnic.

Within the first chamber such as in surrounding relation with the first gas generant material therein contained is a filter assembly . Such a filter assembly may include one or more of a combustion screen or filter such as for example formed of multiple layers or wraps of a metal screen a filter damper pad or the like.

The inflator assembly also includes a retainer such as may serve as a construction expedient to retain the inflator assembly components in proper relative arrangement and prevent undesired flow passage through the assembly.

As identified above the base portion of the inflator device advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. In particular such benefit is realizable through the use of a structural component such as herein described for a duplex firing inflator. The structural component can be a molded element and contains a duplex firing initiator assembly . The duplex firing initiator assembly includes a primary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition and a secondary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition . In the duplex firing initiator assembly the primary and secondary initiators and are disposed in vertical firing placement within the structural component .

In the duplex firing initiator assembly current is conducted in a first or forward polarity through the primary initiator to actuate the primary initiator and current is conducted in a second or reverse as compared to the first polarity through the secondary initiator to actuate at least the secondary initiator. Such initiator assemblies are a subject of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 688 839 entitled DUPLEX ACTUATION SYSTEM FOR INFLATABLE RESTRAINTS filed on 29 Nov. 2012 and incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As shown the primary initiator and the secondary initiator in the duplex firing initiator can be encapsulated in molded plastic during mold processing such as at least in part via respective plastic seals and . This can advantageously provide sealing confinement electrical isolation and breakout for the pyrotechnic output composition for each initiator. In contrast sealing confinement electrical isolation and breakout in present inflator devices are typically provided through the use of a metal containment cup and an electrical isolation sleeve. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided the elimination of these two components beneficially reduces component count design complexity and manufacturing processes and can additionally reduce cost of manufacture and production.

It is to be understood however that if desired a duplex firing initiator can alternatively be used in conjunction with containment cups such as of a suitable metal for containing respective pyrotechnic output compositions for the respective initiators.

Even in such case however the utilization of a duplex firing initiator as herein described desirably eliminates the need for a second initiator adapter with its associated processing and costs and as further described below better aligns this new inflator technology with existing state of the art single stage inflator technology.

As shown in the component molded element is desirably integrally molded with the base portion such as at or near the mounting opening . Molding is a process that has hereto previously been used in certain state of the art single stage inflators. Previous dual stage inflators have required the use of welding to join igniter adapters to inflator device chamber walls in order to maintain the necessary degree or level of chamber wall strength required to ensure safe operation of the inflator device upon actuation. Through the need for only a single mounting opening in the inflator chamber wall inflator chamber wall strength is sufficiently maintained that mold processing can now be advantageously applied to dual stage inflators.

In the inflator device the component also includes an integrally molded first stage igniter booster cup . The booster cup desirably includes discreet gas exit opening to permit the exiting of reaction production upon operation. The gas exit openings are also desirably integrally molded therein such as to reduce the cost of manufacture and production. The gas exit openings can as shown include or have a thin protective breakout web thereover such as to shield or protect the contents of the igniter booster cup from external influences and yet appropriately open or breakout during inflator device operation.

The booster cup desirably includes or contains a quantity of a suitable igniter or ignition booster material such as is known in the art to appropriately facilitate or speed desired ignition of the first gas generant material upon proper actuation.

Associated with the booster cup is a corresponding lid closure to desirably maintain the booster material in proper disposition.

Similar to the above described inflator device in the inflator device the first chamber also houses or contains a second chamber . In the inflator device however the component also includes an integrally molded second stage gas generant cup .

Similar to in the inflator device described above in the inflator device the generant cup and the lid closure cooperate to form a generant cup interior wherein is desirably placed a selected quantity of a second gas generant material . The second gas generant material may typically be in the form of a pyrotechnic material and may be either the same or different in composition shape size or form as compared to the first gas generant material .

The generant cup and the lid closure further desirably cooperate and function in a manner such as to permit the combustion products formed by reaction of the gas generant material when properly and desirably actuated to pass from the second chamber out into the first chamber through the filter assembly and the exit ports out from the inflator assembly and into an associated airbag cushion not shown .

By molding features such as the first stage igniter booster cup the booster cup gas exit openings the gas exit opening breakout web and the second stage gas generant cup into the inflator device component significant reductions can be realized in inflator size weight and number of components as well as in design complexity and in manufacturing processes and costs. It is to be understood however that the invention can be practiced as may be desired through the selective incorporation of none or one or more of such features into a desired component in accordance with the invention.

While the invention has been described above making specific reference to the inflator device shown in and including a duplex firing initiator wherein the primary initiator and the secondary initiator are in vertical firing placement within the component it will be understood by those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provide that the broader practice of the invention is not necessarily so limited.

For example illustrates a dual stage duplex firing inflator in accordance with another aspect of the invention and generally designated by the reference numeral . The inflator device is shown in a static state or condition e.g. prior to actuation. The inflator device is generally similar to the inflator device described above in that it includes a lower shell or base portion and an upper shell or diffuser cap portion . The diffuser cap portion includes a top wall and a cylindrical sidewall which includes a plurality of gas exit ports . The base portion similarly advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. The base portion may also as shown include a peripheral bracket such as may serve to form an interface attachment which is used to attach the inflator assembly to a vehicle.

The housing is configured to define a central first chamber . The first chamber contains or houses a supply of a first gas generant material not shown such as typically in the form of a pyrotechnic. Within the first chamber such as in surrounding relation with the first gas generant material therein contained is a filter assembly . The inflator assembly also includes a retainer as described above.

Similar to the inflator device the base portion of the inflator device advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. In particular such benefit is realizable through the use of a structural component such as herein described for a duplex firing inflator. The structural component can be a molded element and contains a duplex firing initiator assembly . The duplex firing initiator assembly includes a primary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition and a secondary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition . The duplex firing initiator assembly differs from the duplex firing initiator assembly shown in the inflator device in that the primary and secondary initiators and are disposed in horizontal rather than vertical firing placement within the respective structural component.

As with the duplex firing initiator in the duplex firing initiator assembly current is conducted in a first or forward polarity through the primary initiator to actuate the primary initiator and current is conducted in a second or reverse as compared to the first polarity through the secondary initiator to actuate at least the secondary initiator.

As shown the primary initiator and the secondary initiator in the duplex firing initiator can be encapsulated in molded plastic during mold processing such as at least in part via respective plastic seals and .

The component molded element is desirably integrally molded with the base portion such as at or near the mounting opening .

The component also includes an integrally molded first stage igniter booster cup . The booster cup desirably includes discreet gas exit opening to permit the exiting of reaction production upon operation. The gas exit openings are also desirably integrally molded therein such as to reduce the cost of manufacture and production. The gas exit openings can as shown include or have a thin protective breakout web thereover such as to shield or protect the contents of the igniter booster cup from external influences and yet appropriately open or breakout during inflator device operation.

The booster cup desirably includes or contains a quantity of a suitable igniter or ignition booster material not shown such as is known in the art to appropriately facilitate or speed desired ignition of the first gas generant material upon proper actuation.

Associated with the booster cup is a corresponding lid closure to desirably maintain the booster material in proper disposition.

Similar to the inflator device the first chamber also houses or contains a second chamber . In the inflator device the component includes an integrally molded second stage gas generant cup .

The generant cup and the lid closure cooperate to form a generant cup interior wherein is desirably placed a selected quantity of a second gas generant material not shown .

The generant cup and the lid closure further desirably cooperate and function in a manner such as to permit the combustion products formed by reaction of the gas generant material therein contained when properly and desirably actuated to pass from the second chamber out into the first chamber through the filter assembly and the exit ports out from the inflator assembly and into an associated airbag cushion not shown .

The duplex firing initiator includes primary and secondary stage initiators and and first and second diodes and disposed onto or with a printed circuit board PCB . As shown such component parts can desirably be appropriately housed or contained in a common housing such as may be fabricated by injection molding. The duplex firing initiator includes two bent connecting pins such as may serve to appropriately direct operating current to the initiator assembly .

Similar to the above described duplex firing initiator and duplex firing initiator assembly in the two pin duplex firing initiator current can be conducted in a first or forward polarity through the primary initiator to actuate the primary initiator and current can be conducted in a second or reverse as compared to the first polarity through a secondary initiator to actuate at least the secondary initiator.

The duplex firing initiator is shown as having two bent connecting pins . Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided will appreciate that the broader practice of the invention is not necessarily so limited. For example if desired or required for a particular application straight connecting pins can alternatively be employed. Further while the duplex firing initiator shows the initiators and having opposite directed discharges with the initiators being offset from one another again the broader practice of the invention is not necessarily so limited. For example if desired or required for a particular application a suitable duplex firing initiator may contain or include primary and secondary initiators that discharge in the same general direction or in which the initiators are directly opposed to one another rather than offset.

The three pin duplex firing initiator includes three connecting pins including first and second side connecting pins and and a center connecting pin . The three pin duplex firing initiator has a housing with a first and a second pocket and respectively. Within each of the pockets and there is disposed a respective bridgewire element and respectively which share the center connecting pin as a ground. For example the first bridgewire element extends between the first side connecting pin to the center connecting pins as seen in the first pocket . Correspondingly the second bridgewire element extends between the second side connecting pin to the center connecting pin as seen in the second pocket .

As identified above structural components such as described above can desirably be produced or formed through mold processing. Mold processing typically requires the application of a significant amount of pressure to move plastic material through the various cavities of the mold.

Advantageously through the practice of aspects herein described such molding pressures can also desirably serve to consolidate a respective initiator pyrotechnic output composition.

For example is a simplified schematic showing the application of consolidating forces depicted by the arrows F onto an unconsolidated pyrotechnic output composition adjacent an electrical bridge of an initiator assembly .

As a result of or through such consolidation intimate contact by or between the electrical bridge of the initiator and the associated initiator pyrotechnic output composition can be better ensured or otherwise enhanced. This is further contrasted with prior art assemblies wherein such consolidation is commonly done as a separate or added pressing operation.

The inflator device is generally similar to the inflator device described above in that for example it includes a housing such as having a lower shell or base portion and an upper shell or diffuser cap portion . The diffuser cap portion includes a top wall and a cylindrical sidewall which includes a plurality of gas exit ports . The base portion similarly advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. The base portion may also as shown include a peripheral bracket such as may serve to form an interface attachment which is used to attach the inflator assembly to a vehicle.

The housing is configured to define a central first chamber . The first chamber contains or houses a supply of a first gas generant material not shown such as typically in the form of a pyrotechnic such as known in the art. Within the first chamber such as in surrounding relation with the first gas generant material therein contained is a filter assembly such as described above. The inflator assembly also includes a retainer such as also described above.

Similar to the inflator device the base portion of the inflator device advantageously includes only a single mounting opening for use in association with initiator devices or assemblies. In particular such benefit is realizable through the use of a structural component such as herein described for a duplex firing inflator.

As perhaps best seen by reference to the structural component can be a molded element and can contain a duplex firing initiator assembly . The duplex firing initiator assembly also shown in isolation in includes a primary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition and a secondary initiator such as with an associated pyrotechnic output composition . The duplex firing initiator assembly has two connecting pins such as may serve to appropriately direct operating current to the initiator assembly.

No. 13 688 839 entitled DUPLEX ACTUATION SYSTEM FOR INFLATABLE RESTRAINTS filed on 29 Nov. 2012 and incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As with the duplex firing initiator assembly shown in the inflator device in the duplex firing initiator assembly the primary and secondary initiators and are disposed in vertical firing placement within the respective structural component. Further as with the duplex firing initiator in the duplex firing initiator assembly current is conducted in a first or forward polarity through the primary initiator to actuate the primary initiator and current is conducted in a second or reverse as compared to the first polarity through the secondary initiator to actuate at least the secondary initiator.

As shown the primary initiator and the secondary initiator in the duplex firing initiator can be encapsulated in molded plastic during mold processing.

While illustrates the duplex firing initiator assembly in isolation illustrate a molded duplex assembly such as generally composed of the duplex firing initiator assembly appropriately encapsulated in molded plastic in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown the encasing molding material can desirably include cavities or voids and such as can be used as mold material runners or as capture or locking features such as may be desirably included such as to facilitate desired placement and securement of the duplex firing initiator assembly within an inflator assembly. For example as perhaps better viewed by reference to via the runners locking features and the molded duplex assembly can be appropriately molded onto the inner hub of the inflator base such as via a molded connector designated by the reference numeral . This process can desirably capture or lock the molded duplex assembly onto the base preferably creating a hermetic seal to the base. As shown in the molded connector can also desirably form or create a molded connector pocket about the connecting pins .

A process for the assembly of the inflator device will now be described by making reference to . As perhaps best seen by reference to an igniter cup can be appropriately filled with a selected ignition booster material not shown sealed and inserted into an igniter canister . An igniter canister ring can then be appropriately press fit into the igniter canister and the whole igniter canister assembly can be appropriately press fit onto the molded duplex assembly about the primary initiator the molded duplex assembly already secured to the inflator base . As seen in the igniter canister includes a plurality of holes or openings to permit upon actuation the ignition reaction products to appropriately communicate with the contents of the first chamber .

The diffuser cap portion can be appropriately secured to the base assembly such as by means of welding or other selected form of joining components together.

Duplex firing inflators such as herein described and provided result in the necessary performance to meet both the IP and OOP requirements. More specifically the integration and use of duplex firing initiator assemblies and structural components including such assemblies such as herein described allow for changes in internal hardware which can reduce the size weight and complexity of the inflator. This in turn decreases the number of components and the manufacturing processes and results in cost savings over the current state of the art inflators.

The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element part step component or ingredient which is not specifically disclosed herein.

While in the foregoing detailed description this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof and many details have been set forth for purposes of illustration it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention.
