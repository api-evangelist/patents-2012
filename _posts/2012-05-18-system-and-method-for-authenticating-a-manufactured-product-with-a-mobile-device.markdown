It should be understood however that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be appreciated however by one skilled in the art that embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without such specific details. In some instances details such as control structures and full software instruction sequences have not been shown in order not to obscure the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art with the included descriptions will be able to implement appropriate functionality without undue experimentation.

References in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an illustrative embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

Embodiments of the invention may be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof. Embodiments of the invention may also be implemented as instructions carried by or stored on a transitory or non transitory machine readable medium which may be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine readable medium may be embodied as any device mechanism or physical structure for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computing device . For example a machine readable medium may be embodied as read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices mini or micro SD cards memory sticks electrical signals and or others.

In the drawings specific arrangements or orderings of schematic elements such as those representing devices instruction blocks and data elements may be shown for ease of description. However it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the specific ordering or arrangement of the schematic elements in the drawings is not meant to imply that a particular order or sequence of processing or separation of processes is required. Further the inclusion of a schematic element in a drawing is not meant to imply that such element is required in all embodiments or that the features represented by such element may not be included in or combined with other elements in some embodiments.

In general irrespective of the terminology used in the drawings or description which may be selected for ease of discussion or other reasons schematic elements used to represent instruction blocks may be implemented using any suitable form of machine readable instruction such as software or firmware applications programs functions modules routines processes procedures plug ins applets widgets code fragments and or others and that each such instruction may be implemented using any suitable programming language library application programming interface API and or other software development tools.

Similarly schematic elements used to represent data or information may be implemented using any suitable electronic arrangement or data structure such as a database data store table record array index hash map tree list graph file of any file type folder directory or other grouping of files header web page meta tag and or others.

Further in the drawings where connecting elements such as solid or dashed lines or arrows are used to illustrate a connection relationship or association between or among two or more other schematic elements the absence of any such connecting elements is not meant to imply that no connection relationship or association exists. In other words some connections relationships or associations between elements may not be shown in the drawings so as not to obscure the invention. Also for ease of illustration a single connecting element may be used to represent multiple connections relationships or associations between elements. For example where a connecting element represents a communication of signals data or instructions it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such element may represent one or multiple signal paths as may be needed to effect the communication.

In some industries it can be important or desirable for a consumer end customer or other participant in the supply chain to be able to easily and reliably determine the authenticity of a manufactured product prior to during or after purchase e.g. at or near the point of sale wherever that may be. Referring now to an illustrative system for authenticating an individual item of a manufactured product is embodied in a mobile computing device . The illustrative mobile computing device can be used by a consumer end customer or other participant in the supply chain for example to identify a manufactured item and find out whether it is authentic simply by taking a digital picture of an authenticating portion of the item using a camera of the mobile computing device . Once the picture is taken a product authenticator application installed on the mobile computing device analyzes the digital picture and uses a cryptographic technique to determine whether the item is authentic that is whether the item is actually what it purports to be and whether it has been certified as authentic by a trusted party such as a known manufacturer of the product. The illustrative product authenticator application does not need to access any remote databases to make this determination although it could do so . Therefore authentication can be performed at the mobile computing device notwithstanding any technological limitations of the geographic area in which the mobile computing device may be located e.g. lack of access to a wireless communication network .

As one example consumers can obtain dosage forms e.g. pills tablets capsules etc. of human or animal drug products e.g. prescription over the counter biological and homeopathic drug products dietary supplements and or others from a variety of sources other than traditional brick and mortar pharmacies such as online or mail order pharmacies and nutrition or fitness outlets for example . In some cases it may be relatively easy or inexpensive for a counterfeiter to create fake drugs that are virtually indistinguishable from the real product in shape size color and labeling such that even a supplier or distributor may be fooled let alone the end customer. Equipping mobile electronic devices including even relatively simple or unsophisticated consumer oriented devices with the product authenticator application can enhance anti counterfeiting efforts at various points in the supply chain.

Referring still to when the manufactured item is photographed by the camera a digital image of at least the authenticating portion of the item is stored in memory e.g. the data storage at the mobile computing device . As described in further detail below the illustrative product authenticator obtains from the digital image of the authenticating portion a digital representation of a an identifying feature e.g. bar code which embodies a digital certificate associated with the manufactured item and a digital representation of an identifying feature of the manufactured item . The product authenticator generates a digital fingerprintfrom the digital representation of the identifying feature created by the camera . The product authenticator also derives a digital signature and a digital fingerprintfrom the digital representation of the identifying feature embodying the digital certificate created by the camera . The product authenticator uses the digital signature and the digital fingerprintobtained from the digital certificate and the digital fingerprintgenerated from the digital representation of the identifying feature to verify the identity of the item and determine whether the item is authentic to a certifying authority e.g. a known manufacturer of the item .

In general the identifying feature of the manufactured item is defined to include an at least partially random feature of the item that is produced from the manufacture of the item which arises from a stochastic process and cannot be economically duplicated by either the manufacturer of the item or a would be counterfeiter and therefore can serve to uniquely identify the physical item . The identifying feature may be a visual feature e.g. perceptible by the human eye and or a digital camera under normal lighting conditions or a non visual feature e.g. detectable with the aid of other non visible forms of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet or infrared radiation or with the aid of vibration energy such as ultrasound . The item may have more than one identifying feature but that term is used in the singular form here for ease of discussion.

As explained below the digital signature derived from the digital certificate is originally generated using the digital fingerprintof the identifying feature and a cryptographic key . The digital fingerprintand the cryptographic key are generated or provided by a trusted certifying authority such as the manufacturer of the item prior to the creation of the digital certificate . A system for encoding a manufactured item with an identifying feature and an identifier embodying the digital certificate is illustrated in FIGS. and and described below. described below illustrate a few examples of a manufactured item that has on at least one surface thereon one or more identifying features and an identifier embodying a digital certificate. illustrate an example of a container and or lid that is designed to facilitate viewing of an identifying feature and or identifier that embodies a digital certificate of a manufactured item while the item is held in the container.

As shown by the exemplary user interfaces which can be displayed on a display of the mobile computing device the product authenticator informs the user of the mobile computing device as to whether the item has or has not been successfully authenticated based on the digital image of the authenticating portion obtained by the camera . More specifically the illustrative product authenticator not only identifies the item as being of a particular kind of product e.g. what is it but can also identify the certifying authority associated with the item e.g. the manufacturer of the particular item if the item is authenticated. If the product authenticator is unable to successfully authenticate the item the user of the mobile computing device is alerted and may be prompted to retry the authentication e.g. by taking another picture of the item as shown by the illustrative user interface . If the product authenticator successfully authenticates the item information about the item and or its use may be presented to the user as shown by the illustrative user interfaces . In either case that is whether or not the authentication is successful the product authenticator may report the authentication information to one or more remote computer systems which may include for example a product tracking system a product database a product usage manager and or a consumer database as described below.

For instance in the dosage form example successful and or unsuccessful authentication attempts may be reported to a computer system used by a manufacturer of the item to monitor the distribution of its dosage forms and identify the location of potential counterfeits. If the item is successfully authenticated the product authenticator may interface with a pharmacy system or medication reminder system for example to retrieve additional details about the user s relationship with the dosage form e.g. prescription or purchase details or to update the user s records relating to his or her usage of the dosage form e.g. in relation to the prescribed use . If the authentication is not successful the product authenticator may associate geographic location information obtained from the locating system with the authentication attempt and send the geographic location and item information to the product tracker to facilitate the tracking of potential counterfeit products or for other reasons.

As another example in some embodiments the product tracker may be configured for use prior to the purchase of the item . In such a pre purchase mode the user of the mobile computing device uses the camera to create a digital image of the item. Upon detecting the image or on initiation by the user the product authenticator analyzes the digital image and attempts to authenticate the item as described herein. If the item is authenticated the product tracker may display e.g. at the display the name of the product the name of the manufacturer the manufacturer s suggested retain price and or other information associated with the item and or the manufacturer. In the dosage form example the information displayed may include the name of the medication expiration date and or expected quantity e.g. in a particular package type . Also once the item is authenticated the product tracker and or the product usage manager may prompt the user of the mobile computing device to fill out warranty registration information to input other information relating to the item the user or the anticipated use of the item or to perform other actions.

In the dosage form example and or others involving ingestible products the product usage manager may have a consumption mode in which the user s intake of the item can be recorded at the mobile computing device . In such a consumption mode the product usage manager may access information about the user s prescription nutrition plan or dietary regimen for example which may be obtained from the consumer database . Based on this information the product usage manager may among other things alert the user when it is time to take a dose of medication warn the user if he or she has already taken the prescribed amount for the day or notify the user that the prescription needs to be refilled. Further the product usage manager may prompt the user to authenticate an individual item prior to consumption so that it may advise the user if the item may not be authentic this may occur if for example the product usage manager has already authenticated an item with the same serial number .

The illustrative mobile computing device is embodied as an electronic device that has a digital camera and computing capabilities. In general the mobile computing device is configured to be carried by a person. For example the mobile computing device may be embodied as a cellular phone a camera phone a smartphone or other mobile phone device a mobile Internet device a handheld laptop or tablet computer an e reader a personal digital assistant a telephony device a netbook a digital camera a portable media player or recorder augmented reality glasses or any other commodity mobile device personal mobile consumer electronic device or portable electronic device that includes a camera capable of capturing still and or video images and a display.

As shown in the mobile computing device includes at least one processor in communication with an input output I O subsystem . The illustrative processor may include one or more processor cores e.g. microprocessors . The I O subsystem may include among other things an I O controller a memory controller and one or more I O ports not shown . The processor and the I O subsystem are communicatively coupled to a memory . The memory may be embodied as any type of suitable memory device such as a dynamic random access memory device DRAM synchronous dynamic random access memory device SDRAM double data rate dynamic random access memory device DDR SDRAM and or other volatile memory device.

The illustrative I O subsystem is communicatively coupled to the camera the product authenticator at least one data storage a locating system the display one or more peripheral devices and one or more network interfaces .

The illustrative camera is embodied as a digital camera or other digital imaging device that is integrated with the mobile computing device . Generally speaking the camera includes an electronic image sensor such as an active pixel sensor APS e.g. a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS sensor or a charge coupled device CCD . No particular minimum image resolution is required of the camera that is the image resolution provided by low end or standard camera phones as well as that of more sophisticated devices is suitable for the purposes of the present disclosure. However the higher the resolution of the camera and or the quality of its included lenses and or image processing software the more difficult it should be for a would be counterfeiter to copy an image from one item to another in an undetectable manner. Thus in some embodiments it may be preferable to use the highest resolution best lenses and or best image processing software that are available in a mobile computing device or similar commodity mobile devices or personal mobile consumer electronic devices. Further although the illustrative embodiment captures digital images using a camera it should be understood that in some embodiments any sensor or combination of sensors integrated with the mobile computing device and capable of measuring identifying feature s for example video or audio sensors may be used to generate digital representations of the identifying feature . In some embodiments the camera and or one or more other sensors of the mobile computing device are sensitive to non visible forms of radiation such as ultraviolet or infrared radiation and therefore are capable of capturing digital images of identifying features that are not visible to the human eye. Thus the mobile computing device may or may be adapted to capture non visual images as a result of a hardware design e.g. by adding or removing physical filters or through the use of camera software that enables the capture of non visual images.

The illustrative product authenticator is embodied as one or more computer executable instructions routines programs processes or the like e.g. software firmware or a combination thereof . At various times all or portions of the product authenticator may be embodied in one or more computer accessible storage media e.g. the memory the data storage a firmware device such as flash memory and or other storage media of the mobile computing device .

The illustrative data storage is embodied as one or more computer accessible storage media such as one or more disk storage devices e.g. hard disks or other suitable data storage devices e.g. memory cards memory sticks and or others . While not specifically shown it should be appreciated that portions of the product authenticator and or the locating system may reside in the data storage in some embodiments and may be copied to the memory during operation for faster processing or other reasons.

In the illustrative embodiment at least one cryptographic key resides in the data storage . For example the cryptographic key may be obtained when the product authenticator is installed e.g. downloaded on the mobile computing device . The illustrative cryptographic key is configured to serve as an input to a cryptographic algorithm that is executable by the product authenticator . In some embodiments the cryptographic key is a public key configured for use in a public key private key digital signature scheme and is part of a public key private key pair issued by a certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer of the item . Some illustrative cryptographic key schemes or techniques that may be used include RSA Rivest Shamir Adleman DSS Data Security Standard e.g. as specified in the 2009 standard Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 186 3 or other factoring based approaches the ElGamal encryption system or other discrete log based approaches elliptic curve based approaches or lattice based approaches. However as should be appreciated by those skilled in the art any suitable cryptographic key scheme or technique may be used taking into consideration the requirements or design of a particular embodiment of the system .

The illustrative locating system may be embodied as computerized instructions routines programs processes or the like e.g. software firmware or a combination thereof that are configured to determine and or monitor the geographic location of the mobile computing device e.g. relative to absolute coordinates such as longitude and latitude using for example a cellular location based service LBS or a global positioning system GPS .

Referring now to modules of the illustrative product authenticator are shown in greater detail. As mentioned above the product authenticator processes one or more digital images of at least the authenticating portion i.e. the identifying feature and the identifier embodying the digital certificate of the manufactured item which are created by the camera . Accordingly the product authenticator interfaces with a digital image creator of the camera using any suitable now known or later developed method or technique as should be understood by those skilled in the art. As it is not part of the product authenticator but rather is a module that is typically a standard feature of the mobile computing device e.g. as part of the camera the digital image creator is illustrated with dashed lines.

The product authenticator is configured to analyze one or more digital images of the authenticating portion of the manufactured item determine the identity of the item and whether the item is authentic as being associated with a certifying authority e.g. the item manufacturer communicate information relating to the identity of the item and whether the item is authentic to the user of the mobile computing device and interface with one or more remote computing devices . The illustrative product authenticator includes an image analyzer module a product authenticating module and an information managing module .

The image analyzer module processes the digital image of the authenticating portion using any suitable now known or later developed image processing methods or techniques as should be understood by those skilled in the art. As explained below the image analyzer module obtains and analyzes the digital representation of the identifying feature and the identifier e.g. bar code embodying the digital certificate which are derived from the digital image of the authenticating portion . The image analyzer module obtains the digital fingerprintfrom the digital representation of the identifying feature and obtains the digital fingerprintfrom the digital certificate . The illustrative image analyzer module includes an error correcting module which may be used in the creation or analysis of the digital fingerprintto allow the digital fingerprintto accommodate variations in digital images that may occur as a result of the analog to digital conversion camera angle lighting conditions and or other factors. Further details of the operation of the image analyzer module and the error correcting module are discussed below in connection with which illustrates a method portions of which are executable by the image analyzer module and or the error correcting module .

The illustrative product authenticating module interfaces with the image analyzer module to obtain the digital fingerprintand the digital certificate . The product authenticating module determines whether the digital fingerprintcorresponds to the identifying feature of the item and whether the digital signature from the digital certificate is associated with a certifying authority e.g. a manufacturer of the item . Further details of the operation of the product authenticating module are discussed below in connection with which illustrates a method portions of which are executable by the product authenticating module .

The illustrative information managing module interfaces with the product authenticating module to obtain information relating to the authentication of the item . The information managing module includes an indicator module a display module and a communication module which interface respectively with one or more of the peripheral devices the display and the network interfaces to output information relating to the authentication of the item in a human perceptible form at the mobile computing device and or to send information relating to item the authentication of the item and or the user of the mobile computing device to one or more of the remote computing devices and or to obtain information from the user of the mobile computing device and or one or more of the remote computing devices . Further details of the operation of the information managing module are discussed below in connection with which illustrates a method portions of which are executable by the information managing module .

While the illustrative product authenticator is configured to process one or more still digital images e.g. digital photographs it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that alternative digital representations corresponding to the identifying feature are possible. For example some embodiments may process moving video images sound recordings or data from other sensors integrated with the mobile computing device . In particular video images may be processed to measure an item s movement and thereby detect density variations in the item and such density variations may be used as the identifying feature .

Referring now to an illustrative method for analyzing a digital image created by the camera of at least an authenticating portion e.g. the identifying feature and the digital certificate of an individual item of a manufactured product is shown. The method may be implemented as one or more computer executable instructions routines processes or the like e.g. software and or firmware . At block a person using the mobile computing device takes a picture e.g. a still image of at least the authenticating portion of the manufactured item with the camera . As described in more detail below with reference to at least part of the authenticating portion is visible to the human eye in the illustrative embodiments and is therefore relatively easy for a person to photograph. However as mentioned above parts of the authenticating portion may not be visible to the human eye in other embodiments but some other visual feature of the item such as a logo or design serves as an indicator to the user of where to focus the camera. For example in some embodiments no part of the authenticating portion is visible to the human eye. In particular for manufactured items such as jewelry apparel or other fashion accessories the manufacturer may not desire visual interruption of the item s carefully designed outer appearance. Such embodiments may require the mobile computing device to more automatically detect the authenticating portion e.g. using infrared or ultraviolet sensing . Block is illustrated with dashed lines to illustrate that it is not a step that needs to be performed by the product authenticator .

At block the method obtains a digital representation of the digital certificate from the digital image taken by the camera . The digital certificate includes the digital fingerprintand a digital signature e.g. bitstrings which have been previously generated by the certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer at block of described below. More specifically the digital fingerprintis generated by the certifying authority based on an identifying feature of the item that is selected by the certifying authority when the item is encoded with the digital certificate in the first place. The digital certificate may contain other textual digital information that may be added by the certifying authority such as serial number batch number expiration date etc. when the digital certificate is created. For instance the digital certificate may include information that may be used by the error correcting module as described below.

At block the method obtains the digital signature the digital fingerprint error correcting information e.g. an offset as will be described below if any and or other data it may need to compute analyze and or verify the digital fingerprint. This may be simply a matter of reading plain text contained in the digital certificate and or interpreting a coded portion of the identifier embodying the digital certificate e.g. a bar code using a suitable technique now known or later developed as should be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The digital signature digital fingerprint offset and or other information read from the digital certificate are used to authenticate the item as shown in and described below.

At block the method computes the digital fingerprintof the identifying feature as captured in a digital image by the camera which is the same identifying feature as was selected by the certifying authority to create the digital fingerprint. There are many digital fingerprinting schemes that are publicly available and any such scheme whether now known or later developed is suitable for purposes of the present disclosure taking into consideration the requirements of a particular design or implementation of the system .

In general a measurable characteristic of the identifying feature is selected for use in creating the digital fingerprint. In the case of the digital fingerprint the measurable characteristic is set by the certifying authority i.e. the same measurable characteristic is used to create both the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprint . A defined area of the identifying feature is selected over which to measure the measurable characteristic. A suitable feature extraction algorithm now known or later developed is applied to the defined measurement area to extract the measurable characteristic from the image and generate a bitstring e.g. a string of binary digits that can be used as a unique identifier of the item . As one example the intensity of a certain pigment used in the manufacture of the item may be selected as the measurable characteristic. As a result of the manufacturing process the pigment intensity varies throughout the defined measurement area of the item in a random stochastic chaotic or otherwise unpredictable way. Measuring the pigment intensity throughout the measurement area creates a vector of pigment intensity values where the length of the vector is defined by the number of measurement units in the measurement area e.g. grid squares . A digital fingerprint can be created from this vector.

As explained further below with reference to the digital fingerprintis compared to the digital fingerprintas part of the authentication process. If the item as evaluated by the end user at the mobile computing device is the same item that was encoded with the digital certificate by the certifying authority these digital fingerprints should match. However since even relatively minor variations in the digital representations of the identifying feature used to generate the digital fingerprints can cause the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprintto differ an error correction technique may be applied to the digital fingerprintand or the digital fingerprintto reduce the risk of the product authenticator incorrectly concluding that the item is not authentic.

At block one or more error correction methods or techniques may be applied to the digital fingerprintgenerated at the mobile computing device to eliminate some of the various inaccuracies and or errors associated with extracting an image and generating a digital fingerprint as discussed above. Of course in some embodiments no error correction may be needed e.g. if the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprintexactly match . One exemplary error correction technique involves using an error correction vector. In such an implementation the offset between a reference model e.g. integer lattice points in an N dimensional real valued space or a subset of lattice points in a N dimensional space each dimension of which is isomorphic to the set of integers modulo some number and the digital fingerprintmay be calculated stored in an error correction vector and included by the certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer of the item in the digital certificate as described below in connection with blocks and of . At block the error correction vector or offset may be applied e.g. by the product authenticator to the digital fingerprint. In some embodiments applying the offset to the digital fingerprintat block may involve subtracting the offset given in the error correction vector from the digital fingerprint rounding the values in the resulting vector to the nearest point in the reference model e.g. a point in N dimensional space where all coordinates are integers and then adding the offset back to get a modified vector that accounts for the given offset and mitigates small errors or perturbations. This modified vector or modified version of the digital fingerprint may then be compared to the digital fingerprint in order to determine whether the digital fingerprints match and thus whether the item is authentic to the certifying authority.

Another illustrative error correction technique involves comparing the digital fingerprintdirectly with the digital fingerprint. To do so the digital fingerprint rather than an error correction vector or offset can be included in the digital certificate by the certifying authority. Alternatively the certifying authority may store the digital fingerprintin computer memory that is accessible to the mobile computing device . For instance the digital fingerprintmay be stored in a database at a remote computing device e.g. the product database of the remote computing device which can be accessed by the mobile computing device via the network . The method may then request the digital fingerprintfrom the remote computing device e.g. a server to compare with the digital fingerprint.

In some embodiments the certifying authority e.g. manufacturer may set acceptable tolerances for differences between the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprint such that the digital fingerprintis considered to match the digital fingerprintif the difference between the two falls within the acceptable tolerance range set by the certifying authority.

Still another error correction technique involves discretizing the measurement values of the digital fingerprintwithout using an offset. For instance dividing and rounding the measurement values according to a pre defined reference model e.g. divide by 100 round to nearest integer can be used to eliminate minor differences that otherwise would cause the digital fingerprints not to match.

Referring now to an illustrative method for authenticating an individual item of a manufactured product and communicating information relating to the item the authentication and or a user of the mobile computing device is shown. The method may be implemented as one or more computer executable instructions routines processes or the like e.g. software and or firmware . At block the method compares the digital fingerprint resulting from block of to the digital fingerprint which results from block of to verify the identity of the item optionally using one or more error correcting techniques as described above. As noted above if the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprinthave been created using the same identifying feature and the item being evaluated by the end user at the mobile computing device is the same as the item certified by the certifying authority the comparison should be successful taking into account the applicable error correcting techniques . In some embodiments the method may end here if the comparison fails.

At block the method attempts to verify that the digital signature obtained from the digital certificate is valid as having originated with the certifying authority e.g. a manufacturer of the item . To do this the method computes a secure hash value of the digital fingerprintand other textual digital information derived from the digital certificate e.g. the additional alphanumeric text added by the manufacturer of the item and applies a cryptographic algorithm to the digital signature using the cryptographic key .

To verify the digital signature the method compares the secure hash value to the output of the cryptographic algorithm at block . There are many cryptographic algorithms and secure hash functions that are publicly available. Thus as should be appreciated by those skilled in the art any suitable secure hash function and cryptographic algorithm may be used by the method in accordance with the requirements of a particular design of the system . However the cryptographic algorithm used at block should correspond to the cryptographic algorithm that was previously used by the certifying authority to generate the digital signature at block of as discussed in more detail below.

If the secure hash value does not correspond to the output of the cryptographic algorithm then it can be inferred that the digital signature is not valid. In such event at block the method outputs a warning indicator or notification. The warning indicator or notification may include a textual message display of a graphic on a user interface an audio e.g. a beep or tone and or visual indicator and or other human perceptible indicator or notification an example of which is shown by the user interface of . At block the method prompts the user to retake the digital picture of the item . If the user responds in the affirmative the method returns to block of . If the user opts not to retake the picture then the method proceeds to block .

At block the method can interface with one or more remote computing devices in some embodiments to send data to one or more remote computer systems e.g. the product tracker or the product usage manager . Alternatively or in addition in some embodiments the method may at block access item information and or information about the user that is stored locally at the mobile computing device in which case block may be optional. As an example if the item is not authenticated the method may access data about the user and or the item that is stored locally in a remote product database or in a remote consumer database for example to try to identify the item and then at block send an alert to a manufacturer s computer system that a possible counterfeit has been detected. The alert may also include information about the geographic location of the mobile computing device which may be obtained from the locating system .

As another example if the item is successfully authenticated the method may access data about the user and or the item that is stored locally in a remote product database or in a remote consumer database and display that information at the mobile computing device e.g. user interfaces .

Referring now to an illustrative system for encoding an individual item of a manufactured product with a marking to uniquely identify the item and its certifying authority e.g. the item s manufacturer to protect the item from counterfeiting or for other reasons is shown. In the illustrative embodiments the manufactured item is a solid oral dosage form of a human drug product such as a pill tablet capsule or the like of a prescription drug over the counter drug homeopathic remedy biological drug product herbal medicine product vitamin dietary supplement or the like. However in other embodiments the manufactured item may be a wristwatch a piece of jewelry a pair of sunglasses a handbag a piece of apparel a fashion accessory a luxury item or other high margin consumer product a consumer electronics device e.g. a phone camera computer media player or media recorder a battery a pair of athletic shoes sports equipment entertainment media e.g. compact discs video discs and or software office supplies such as ink or toner cartridges a replacement part for an automobile vehicle machinery or appliance or other manufactured product that may be susceptible to counterfeiting. For example in some embodiments the manufactured item may be any product that contains a manufactured material or ingredient in or on which an identifying feature can be generated including oral or non oral solid dosage forms of human or animal drug products polymers plastics ceramics metals fabrics rubbers and other elastomers paper cardboard or other packaging for a manufactured product and or others.

As described in more detail below an identifying feature generator manufactures the item to include an authenticating portion which contains one or more identifying features . A computing device equipped with an imaging device can create a digital image of the manufactured item and more particularly a digital image of the identifying feature s . The computing device is configured with a certificate generator application which can create a digital signature based on a digital representation of one or more of the identifying features e.g. the digital fingerprint using a cryptographic key . The certificate generator creates a digital certificate that includes the digital signature and other information as described below. An item encoder adds an identifier e.g. bar code that embodies the digital certificate to or otherwise associates the digital certificate with the item .

Once the item is encoded its authenticating portion includes both the identifying feature s and the identifier e.g. bar code that embodies the digital certificate as depicted by the arrow . In the same reference numerals are used in both depictions of the manufactured item to illustrate that other than the addition of the identifier that embodies the digital certificate the manufactured item is essentially unchanged by the operation of the identifying feature generator the certificate generator and the item encoder .

The illustrative identifying feature generator is a computerized component of an automated product manufacturing system. The identifying feature generator is configured to control one or more steps in the process of manufacturing the item so that the identifying feature s are created in the item during or as a result of that process. In some embodiments the identifying feature generator controls the introduction of an inactive ingredient additive or other agent to create an at least partially random or stochastic visual feature in one or more surfaces of the item . For instance the identifying feature generator may control the timing amount duration method and or other process parameter of the introduction of one or more substances such as one or more contrasting or coloring agents to the item during manufacture so as to create the at least partially random visual feature in or on at least one surface of the item . As one example in embodiments where the item is an uncoated pill or tablet the identifying feature generator may control the blending or mixing of one or more ingestible e.g. edible coloring agents e.g. a Federal Food Drug Cosmetic Act or FD C certified color additive or a natural food dye with other ingredients of the pill or tablet. As another example in embodiments where the item is a coated pill or tablet or a capsule the identifying feature generator may control the blending or mixing of one or more ingestible coloring agents with the item s coating material and or the application of the coloring or mixed coating to the surface of the item . In other embodiments of the item e.g. non ingestible products similar techniques can be used to imperfectly add one or more coloring or contrasting agents to the item to create the desired identifying feature but without the requirement that the additive be ingestible. In still other embodiments the identifying feature may be created as a normal or natural result of the manufacturing process rather than the result of the introduction of a coloring agent or other substance specifically for this purpose. In addition as should be understood by those skilled in the art any suitable manufacturing techniques for creating an at least two dimensional random stochastic and or chaotic design pattern or other visually perceptible feature in or on at least one surface of the item may be used. In addition while a visual feature is mentioned in connection with the illustrative embodiments in other embodiments the at least partially random feature may include a portion that is not visible to the human eye such as a portion that is only visible under infrared or ultraviolet light and or may include one or more transparent components such as sugar salt or another edible crystal alone or in combination with any of the foregoing. Further in some embodiments the at least partially random feature may include a physical property of the item other than appearance such as the weight of the item variations in density of the item internal grains or grain boundaries parting lines and or texture cracks or other irregularities in the shape or surface of the item .

As a result of the operation of the identifying feature generator one or more identifying features is created in or on at least one surface of the manufactured item . That is in the illustrative embodiments the identifying features result from the manufacture of the item e.g. they do not occur naturally in the item . As alluded to above the illustrative identifying features include an at least partially random visual feature that is virtually non reproducible or at least not economically due to its random qualities and the fact that it is part of the physical make up of the manufactured item . Accordingly the digital certificate created therefrom and the resulting identifier embodying the digital certificate should be unique to the item and usable to distinguish the item from other items of the same kind and from other products. For example while it may be possible to copy the digital certificate or identifier embodying the same and apply it to another item e.g. a counterfeit version of the item authentication should fail at that point because the digital certificate should not correspond to any identifying feature shown in a digital image of such other item.

In the illustrative system the identifying feature generator and the item encoder are computerized applications that reside on one or more remote computing devices which are in communication with the computing device via a network . The computing device is also in communication with one or more remote computing devices via the network . The remote computing device s house a cryptographic key database and a product database which may be accessed by the certificate generator to create the digital certificate as explained further below.

As shown in the illustrative computing device includes at least one processor in communication with an input output I O subsystem . The illustrative processor includes one or more processor cores e.g. microprocessors . The I O subsystem may include among other things an I O controller a memory controller and one or more I O ports not shown . The processor and the I O subsystem are communicatively coupled to a memory . The memory may be embodied as any type of suitable memory device such as a dynamic random access memory device DRAM synchronous dynamic random access memory device SDRAM double data rate dynamic random access memory device DDR SDRAM and or other volatile memory device. The illustrative I O subsystem is communicatively coupled to an imaging device the certificate generator at least one data storage one or more peripheral devices and one or more network interfaces .

The illustrative imaging device is embodied as a digital camera or other digital imaging device that is in communication with or incorporated into the computing device . In some embodiments the camera may include an electronic image sensor such as an active pixel sensor APS e.g. a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS sensor or a charge coupled device CCD . In other embodiments the imaging device may be embodied as a laser scanning device or other detection instrument. The image resolution of the imaging device may be similar to or higher than that of the camera .

The illustrative certificate generator is embodied as one or more computer executable instructions routines programs processes or the like e.g. software firmware or a combination thereof . At various times all or portions of the certificate generator may be embodied in one or more computer accessible storage media e.g. the memory the data storage a firmware device such as flash memory and or other storage media of the computing device .

The illustrative data storage is embodied as one or more computer accessible storage media such as one or more disk storage devices e.g. hard disks or other suitable data storage devices e.g. memory cards memory sticks and or others . While not specifically shown it should be appreciated that portions of the certificate generator may reside in the data storage in some embodiments and may be copied to the memory during operation for faster processing or other reasons.

In the illustrative embodiment at least one cryptographic key resides in the data storage . For example the cryptographic key may be obtained from the cryptographic key database when the certificate generator is installed on the computing device . The illustrative cryptographic key is configured to serve as an input to a cryptographic algorithm that is executable by the certificate generator . In some embodiments the cryptographic key is a private key configured for use in a public key private key digital signature scheme and is therefore intended to be kept secret. The cryptographic key is part of a public key private key pair issued by a certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer of the item . For instance in some embodiments the cryptographic key is a private key that is used to create a corresponding public key e.g. the cryptographic key whereby the private key cannot be readily derived from the public key and vice versa without additional information that is not readily known. As mentioned above some illustrative cryptographic key schemes or techniques that may be used include RSA Rivest Shamir Adleman DSS Data Security Standard e.g. as specified in the 2009 standard Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS or other factoring based approaches the ElGamal encryption system or other discrete log based approaches elliptic curve based approaches or lattice based approaches. However as should be appreciated by those skilled in the art any suitable cryptographic key scheme may be used taking into consideration the requirements or design of a particular embodiment of the system and or the system .

The peripheral devices may include for example a keyboard keypad touch screen microphone speaker visual indicator e.g. a light emitting diode or LED display e.g. a liquid crystal display or LCD or other suitable device for accepting input from or presenting output to a user at the computing device . In some embodiments the peripheral devices may include graphics sound and or video adapters and or other devices depending upon for example the intended use of the computing device .

The illustrative network interface s communicatively couple the computing device to one or more networks which may include a local area network wide area network personal cloud enterprise cloud public cloud and or the Internet for example. Accordingly the network interface may include a wired or wireless Ethernet adapter WIFI adapter or other suitable device as may be needed pursuant to the specifications and or design of the particular network and or the computing device .

The computing device may include other components sub components and devices not illustrated in for clarity of the description. Also it should be understood by those skilled in the art that some of the illustrated components may not be required in some embodiments of the computing device . For example the peripheral devices and or the network interfaces may not be required by some embodiments of the computing device . In general the components of the computing device are communicatively coupled as shown in by one or more signal paths which are represented schematically as bidirectional arrows. Such signal paths may be embodied as any type of wired or wireless signal paths capable of facilitating communication between the respective devices.

The illustrative computing device communicates via the network with one or more remote computing devices m and or one or more remote computing devices n where m and n can respectively have a value of zero or any positive integer. The remote computing devices may be embodied in or as any type of computing device or network of computing devices capable of performing at least the functions described herein as being performable by a computing device associated with a identifying feature generating application e.g. an item encoding application e.g. a cryptographic key database e.g. and or a product information database e.g. . In general the remote computing devices include hardware components e.g. processor memory I O subsystem data storage communication circuitry peripheral devices similar or analogous to those described above in connection with the mobile computing device or the computing device therefore those descriptions are not repeated here.

All or portions of the computing devices may be embodied in or as a desktop computer an enterprise computer system a network of computers an Internet enabled hosting service or other electronic device system or combination of any of the foregoing which is capable of facilitating the identifying feature generating certificate generating and or item encoding features described herein. For instance in some embodiments one or more of the computing devices or portions thereof may be embodied as a cellular phone a camera phone a smartphone or other mobile phone device a mobile Internet device a handheld laptop or tablet computer an e reader a personal digital assistant a telephony device a netbook a digital camera a portable media player or recorder or other commodity mobile device personal mobile consumer electronic device or portable electronic device. Also it should be understood that although shown separately in for ease of discussion all or any combination of the certificate generator the identifying feature generator the item encoder the cryptographic key database and the product database may reside on the same computing device or common computing devices in some embodiments.

For example all or portions of the certificate generator the identifying feature generator the item encoder the cryptographic key database and the product database may be local to a particular computing device . or may be distributed across multiple computing devices . In some embodiments portions of the certificate generator the identifying feature generator the item encoder the cryptographic key database and the product database may be installed on the computing device while other portions of the certificate generator the identifying feature generator the item encoder the cryptographic key database and the product database may reside in one or more computer accessible media e.g. memory on one or more remote servers e.g. one or more physical or logical servers or storage devices accessible by multiple users an Internet site e.g. a server hosting a web page or web based application and or other suitable locations depending on the type and or configuration of the particular embodiment. For example any of the certificate generator the identifying feature generator the item encoder the cryptographic key database and the product database may be offered as a service by a third party provider.

The network may be embodied as any type of wireless telecommunications network similar or analogous to the network described above. Additionally the network may include any number of additional devices as needed to facilitate communication between or among the computing device and the remote computing devices such as routers switches intervening computers and or others. Any suitable communication protocol e.g. TCP IP may be used to effect communication over the network depending on for example the particular type or configuration of the network .

Referring now to illustrative embodiments of an authenticating portion of an item of a manufactured product are shown. Referring to an authenticating portion of the item includes a surface . As a result of the operation of the identifying feature generator the surface includes an identifying feature which in the illustrative embodiment includes a two dimensional random stochastic or chaotic swirl pattern or design resulting from the introduction of one or more contrasting or coloring agents such as an ink colored powder dye or colored fiber during manufacture of the item . While omitted from the drawings for clarity it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other portions of the surface may include similar features or be similarly patterned due to the introduction of the contrasting or coloring agent s . Also while the illustrative embodiment contemplates the deliberate introduction of one or more identifying agents to create the identifying feature in these and or other embodiments the identifying feature may simply arise from stochastic variations occurring as part of the normal manufacturing process.

As explained further below the certificate generator analyzes a digital representation of the identifying feature and defines a location of the identifying feature on the surface using e.g. a coordinate system. In the embodiment of the location of the identifying feature is defined by a boundary which also defines a window in the identifying feature through which the identifying feature can be viewed. The boundary can define the measurement area for digital fingerprinting purposes. The certificate generator interprets the digital representation of the identifying feature to create a digital fingerprint as described above generates the digital certificate and incorporates the digital certificate into the identifying feature . In some embodiments the certificate generator determines a location e.g. coordinates on the surface at which identifying feature can be applied without obscuring the identifying feature . In the embodiment of the location of the identifying feature is defined to substantially surround but not interfere with the identifying feature In the illustrative embodiments the identifying feature is embodied as a two dimensional human readable code such as a bar code or matrix bar code which is visible to a human eye and detectable by a camera of a mobile computing device e.g. device and embodies the digital certificate. However in other embodiments the identifying feature and or similar identifying features described herein as embodying a digital certificate may be implemented as a three dimensional bar code or another combination of graphical and or text elements or other suitable form of visually perceptible or machine readable identifier. Surrounding the identifying feature with the identifying feature as in the embodiment of facilitates picture taking of the authenticating portion as the location of the identifying feature is clearly recognizable as being bounded by the identifying feature and thus both the identifying feature and the digital certificate may be photographed at the same time. In the embodiment of the identifying feature is applied to the surface by the item encoder although as mentioned elsewhere in this disclosure the identifying feature may be attached to the item s packaging or otherwise associated with the item .

Referring now to another embodiment of an authenticating portion of the manufactured item is shown. The authenticating portion includes a surface . During manufacture of the item the surface is configured to include a number of identifying features and which are defined by boundaries respectively in a similar fashion as described above. Each of the identifying features includes an at least partially random swirl pattern or stochastic feature as described above. One or more of the identifying features are used by the certificate generator to create a digital certificate which is embodied in an identifying feature as described further below. The identifying feature is applied by the item encoder to the surface so that it does not obscure at least those identifying feature s that are used to create the identifying feature .

Referring to another embodiment of an authenticating portion of the manufactured item is shown. The authenticating portion includes two surfaces that may oppose each other in some embodiments as may be the case in for instance the dosage form example . An identifying feature which embodies a digital certificate is applied to the surface . The identifying feature is located on the surface so as to allow room for an area . A human readable code or other information may be imprinted embossed or otherwise applied to the surface in the area . The information may include a brand name product name or other label associated with the item . For instance in the dosage form example the information may include an identification code label or other marking that may be required by one or more government regulatory agencies.

The surface is configured during manufacture of the item to include an identifying feature which includes an at least partially random stochastic chaotic or otherwise unpredictable swirl pattern design or feature as described above. The location of the identifying feature on the surface is defined by a boundary e.g. coordinates in a similar fashion as described above.

In each case the identifying feature is selected so as to function as a unique identifier that cannot be economically reproduced by either the manufacturer or a would be counterfeiter and thus can be used to distinguish the individual item from other items of the same or different types of items or products and. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the boundaries need not be physically defined in or on the respective surface although they could be but rather may simply be a portion of the surface defined by one or more sets of coordinates derived from the digital representation of the identifying feature . Additionally although the illustrative identifying features are shown as rectangular in shape it should be understood that identifying features may take any shape regular or irregular or size in other embodiments according to the requirements of a particular design.

Referring now to modules of the illustrative certificate generator application are shown in greater detail. As mentioned above the certificate generator processes one or more digital images of at least the identifying feature s of the manufactured item that are created by the imaging device . Accordingly the certificate generator interfaces with a digital image creator of the imaging device using any suitable now known or later developed method or technique as should be understood by those skilled in the art. As it is not part of the certificate generator but rather is a module that is typically a standard feature of the computing device e.g. as part of the imaging device the digital image creator is illustrated with dashed lines.

The certificate generator is configured to analyze one or more digital representations of the identifying feature s of the manufactured item create the digital certificate therefrom and interface with the item encoder via the network to apply an identifying feature including the digital certificate to or otherwise associate the digital certificate with the item . For instance in some embodiments an identifying feature embodying the digital certificate may be applied to a surface of the item while in other embodiments the identifying feature embodying the digital certificate may not be physically attached to the item but may be delivered by other means such as via packaging a product insert sheet or a digital download. The illustrative certificate generator includes an image analyzer module a digital certificate generating module a communication module an identifying feature locating module an identifying feature selecting module and an error correcting module .

The image analyzer module processes the digital images of the identifying features using any suitable now known or later developed image processing methods or techniques as should be understood by those skilled in the art. More specifically the image analyzer module measures a stochastic feature of the item that is part of the identifying feature s as derived from the digital image created by the imaging device and computes the digital fingerprinttherefrom. The stochastic feature measured by the image analyzer module is the same measurement characteristic used to generate the digital fingerprint. The illustrative image analyzer module includes an error correcting module which may be used in the creation of the digital fingerprintand or the digital certificate . Further details of the operation of the image analyzer module and the error correcting module are discussed below in connection with which illustrates a method portions of which are executable by the image analyzer module and or the error correcting module .

The illustrative digital certificate generating module interfaces with the image analyzer module to obtain the results of the analysis of the digital representations of the identifying feature s namely the digital fingerprint . The digital certificate generating module creates the digital certificate using the digital fingerprintand additional textual information supplied by the certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer . The digital certificate generating module may in some embodiments interface with an identifying feature locating module and or an identifying feature selecting module . Further details of the operation of the digital certificate generating module the identifying feature locating module and the identifying feature selecting module are discussed below in connection with which illustrates a method portions of which are executable by one or more of these modules. The illustrative communication module interfaces with the digital certificate generating module to obtain the digital certificate for the item or an identifying feature embodying the digital certificate . The communication module may interface with one or more of the peripheral devices and or the network interfaces to output information relating to the digital certificate in a human perceptible form at the computing device and or to send the digital certificate or an identifying feature embodying the digital certificate to the remote computing device for use by the item encoder for example.

Referring now to an illustrative method for encoding an individual item of a manufactured product to prevent counterfeiting which may be implemented as one or more computer executable instructions routines processes or the like e.g. software and or firmware is shown. At block the computing device obtains a digital image of at least the authenticating portion of the manufactured item . Block is illustrated with dashed lines to illustrate that it is not a step that needs to be performed by the certificate generator .

At block the method determines the locations e.g. coordinates of the identifying features on the digital image obtained at block and obtains digital representations of each of the identifying features if there are more than one. To locate the identifying features the method may analyze the digital fingerprintto identify one or more areas on the item that appear to have a greater degree of randomness or stochastic features. The boundaries described above with reference to may be defined as a result of this analysis.

Once the identifying feature or features are defined at block then at block if there are multiple identifying features the method may analyze the identifying features and select one or more of them for use in creating the digital certificate . The criteria used at block to select an identifying feature may include for example the location of the identifying feature relative to the desired placement of the identifying feature embodying the digital certificate e.g. bar code on the item the clarity and or randomness e.g. reproducibility or lack thereof of the identifying feature and or other factors depending on the requirements or design of a particular implementation of the method .

At block the digital fingerprintis created for each of the selected identifying features in a similar fashion as described above. In general a measurable characteristic of the identifying feature is selected for use in creating the digital fingerprint. The measurable characteristic used to create the digital fingerprintis the same measurable characteristic used to create the digital fingerprint. A defined measurement area of the identifying feature is selected over which to measure the measurable characteristic. For example the defined measurement area may be the area defined by the boundaries described above with reference to . The defined measurement area used to create the digital fingerprintis the same as the defined measurement area used to create the digital fingerprint. A suitable feature extraction algorithm corresponding to the feature extraction algorithm of block of is applied to the defined measurement area to extract the measurable characteristic from the digital image created by the imaging device and generate a bitstring that can be used as a unique identifier of the item .

At block an error correction method may be applied to the digital fingerprintby the certifying authority e.g. the manufacturer of the item . The error correction vector methods described above with reference to may employ a reference model that can be used to reduce the effect of deviations between the digital representations of identifying features that are taken by the camera and digital representations that are taken by the imaging device or to correct for differences that occur from one image to another created at the same device. A suitable reference model may be established or defined at block . For example in the offset error correction technique the reference model may stipulate that an N dimensional vector of positive integers be used to determine the offset. In the simplified discretizing technique the reference model may specify the terms for dividing and rounding e.g. divide the digital fingerprint by 100 and then round to the nearest integer .

In the illustrative offset error correction method described above the digital fingerprintobtained by the certifying authority is compared to the reference model e.g. an N dimensional integer lattice reference model to determine the offset i.e. error correction vector at block where the offset represents the difference between the digital fingerprintand the reference model. The error correction vector or offset may be incorporated into the digital certificate at block . In the full comparison error correction technique described above in which a one to one comparison of the digital fingerprintand the digital fingerprintis performed the certifying authority may specify an acceptable tolerance range at block rather than a reference model. In this technique block would be omitted and the digital fingerprintand the tolerance range rather than an offset may be incorporated into the digital certificate or stored in e.g. a database at block .

At block the method creates the digital signature to be incorporated into the digital certificate . To do this the method combines e.g. concatenates the digital fingerprintand the textual information of the digital certificate and computes a secure hash value therefrom. The secure hash value is input to a cryptographic algorithm along with the cryptographic key e.g. the certifying authority s private key to create the digital signature.

At block the method generates the digital certificate using the digital signature generated at block and selected other information such as the error correction information computed at block information about the item and or its manufacturer e.g. batch number expiration date etc. . As discussed above at block the error correction vector or offset calculated at block or the digital fingerprintand or tolerance or the discretizing model as the case may be can be incorporated into the digital certificate . The method may then incorporate the digital certificate into an identifying feature e.g. bar code etc. which may be applied to or otherwise associated with the item .

At block the method determines whether to repeat the foregoing blocks to generate another digital certificate for another item of the manufactured product. As noted above each digital certificate is intended to be unique to each individual item of the manufactured product. If additional digital certificates are to be generated for other items then the method returns to block . if no additional digital certificates are to be generated then the method may end or may proceed to block . At block the method may utilize all or a portion of the item specific digital certificates created previously to generate another identifying feature e.g. bar code that can be applied to a container that holds the manufactured items. For instance the method may derive item serial numbers from the item specific digital certificates concatenate them and use a cryptographic algorithm to generate an identifying feature that can be affixed to the container. Among other things the container specific digital certificate can be used alone or in combination with one or more of the item specific digital certificates to validate the authenticity of multiple items in the container. For instance in some embodiments the container specific digital certificate may be used to validate one or more items in a supply of such items without having to remove them from their container.

Referring now to an illustrative container is shown which can be used to facilitate the validation of items held in the container without having to remove them from the container. illustrate opposing sides of the container . The container includes a receptacle body portion having a surface a surface which may be integral with the surface a base and a removable cover or lid . The surface s and base define an interior region in which the items can be held. In the illustrative embodiment the surface supports a window which is a substantially transparent portion of the surface defined to allow viewing of the contents of the container from the exterior. In other embodiments the window may be defined in the cover the base or other suitable location on the container . In some embodiments the window may have a lens that effectively magnifies the image of the items stored within container to facilitate imaging.

A pair of retainers are supported by the surface on opposing sides of the window . The retainers are configured to hold a item in a position adjacent the window while the item is stored in the container so that the authenticating portion of the item can be photographed with the camera from outside the container e.g. through the window without removing the item from the container. The retainers may include a detent or depression that preferentially aligns one or more of the items stored in the container with the window to facilitate imaging. In some embodiments one or more of the retainers may be defined in or the window itself. Further while the illustrative embodiment shows two retainers it should be understood that any number of retainers including zero may be used in other embodiments according to the requirements of a particular design. Also while the illustrative embodiment shows retainers and window on the surface it should be understood that the retainers and window may be located anywhere on the container in other embodiments.

As shown in the surface of the illustrative container supports a label which includes an identifying feature which embodies a digital certificate of the container specific type described above. also illustrates an alternative embodiment of a cover or lid . The cover or lid has defined therein a window which is similar or analogous to the window described above.
