The present application relates to novel 3 phenylpropionic acid derivatives which carry a branched or cyclic alkyl substituent in the 3 position to processes for their preparation to their use for the treatment and or prevention of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and or prevention of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitric oxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

Through the production of cGMP and the regulation resulting therefrom of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure thromboses stroke and myocardial infarction.

A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.

Compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment O. V. Evgenov et al. 5 2006 755 .

Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase i.e. without previous release of NO have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC 1 was the first NO independent but haem dependent sGC stimulator described Evgenov et al. ibid. . Based on YC 1 further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC 1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases PDE . This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41 2272 BAY 41 8543 and BAY 63 2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF 1571 and A 350619 these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators Evgenov et al. ibid. . A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO independent and selective activation of the haem containing sGC. In addition the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl haem complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the haem group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the haem free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above Evgenov et al. ibid. .

In addition NO and haem independent sGC activators with BAY 58 2667 as prototype of this class have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation and that the activation of the oxidized or haem free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the haem containing enzyme Evgenov et al. ibid. J. P. Stasch et al. 136 2002 773 J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 . Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58 2667 displaces the oxidized haem group which as a result of the weakening of the iron histidine bond is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC haem binding motif Tyr x Ser x Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the haem group and for the action of BAY 58 2667. Against this background it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58 2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the haem group J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 .

The compounds described in the present invention are now likewise capable of activating the haem free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that these novel activators firstly have no synergistic action with NO at the haem containing enzyme and that secondly their action cannot be blocked by the haem dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3 a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ but is even potentiated by this inhibitor cf. O. V. Evgenov et al. 5 2006 755 J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 .

It was thus an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.

In general it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg kg of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg kg of body weight.

It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts specifically as a function of the body weight route of administration individual response to the active compound nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance in some cases less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.

The pharmacological effect of the compounds according to the invention can be shown in the following assays 

Investigations on the stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase sGC by the compounds according to the invention with and without sodium nitroprusside and with and without the haem dependent sGC inhibitor 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ are carried out by the method described in detail in the following reference M. Hoenicka E. M. Becker H. Apeler T. Sirichoke H. Schroeder R. Gerzer and J. P. Stasch Purified soluble guanylyl cyclase expressed in a baculovirus Sf9 system Stimulation by YC 1 nitric oxide and carbon oxide 77 1999 14 23. The haem free guanylate cyclase is obtained by adding Tween 20 to the sample buffer 0.5 in the final concentration .

The activation of sGC by a test substance is reported as x fold stimulation of the basal activity. The result for Example 22 is shown in Table 1 

It is evident from Table 1 that stimulation both of the haem containing and of the haem free enzyme is achieved. Furthermore combination of Example 22 and 2 N N diethylamino diazenolate 2 oxide DEA NO an NO donor shows no synergistic effect i.e. the effect of DEA NO is not potentiated as would be expected with an sGC activator acting via a haem dependent mechanism. In addition the effect of the sGC activator according to the invention is not blocked by 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ a haem dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase but is in fact increased. The results in Table 1 thus confirm the mechanism of action of the compounds according to the invention as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase.

The cellular action of the compounds according to the invention is determined at a recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell line as described in F. Wunder et al. 339 104 112 2005 .

Soluble guanylate cyclase sGC converts on stimulation GTP into cGMP and pyrophosphate PPi . PPi is detected with the aid of the assay described below. The signal produced in the assay increases as the reaction progresses and serves as a measure of the sGC enzyme activity under the given stimulation.

To carry out the assay 29 l of enzyme solution 0 10 nM soluble guanylate cyclase prepared according to Hinicka et al. 77 14 23 1999 in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 are initially introduced into a microplate and 11 of the substance to be tested as a serially diluted solution in DMSO is added.

Then 201 of detection mix 1.2 nM Firefly Luciferase luciferase Promega 29 M dehydroluciferin prepared according to Bitler McElroy 72 358 1957 122 M luciferin Promega 153 M ATP Sigma and 0.4 mM DTT Sigma in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 are added. The enzyme reaction is started by adding 201 of substrate solution 1.25 mM guanosine 5 triphosphate Sigma in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 and measured continuously in a luminometer. The extent of the stimulation by the substance to be tested can be determined relative to the signal of the unstimulated reaction.

The activation of haem free guanylate cyclase is examined by addition of 25 M of 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3 a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ to the enzyme solution and subsequent incubation for minutes and compared to the stimulation of the native enzyme.

A commercially available telemetry system from Data Sciences International DSI USA is employed for the measurements on conscious SH rats described below.

The system consists of 3 main components 1 implantable transmitters 2 receivers which are linked via a multiplexer to a 3 data acquisition computer. The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record the blood pressure and heart rate of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SH rats with a body weight of 200 g. After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water. The day night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6.00 am and at 7.00 pm.

The telemetry transmitters TAM PA C40 DSI employed are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and layered closure of the wound is performed. An antibiotic Tardomyocel COMP Bayer AG 1 ml kg s.c. is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.

The substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals n 6 . The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 strength Tylose appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight. A solvent treated group of animals is employed as control.

The telemetry measuring unit is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number.

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI . The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for Windows DSI and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

In the standard procedure the following are measured for 10 second periods in each case 1 systolic blood pressure SBP 2 diastolic blood pressure DBP 3 mean arterial pressure MAP and 4 heart rate HR .

The acquisition of measured values is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the documentation from the manufacturing company DSI .

The test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours. After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. Analysis . The void value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration of the substance so that the selected data set includes the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am on the following day.

The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average 15 minute average 30 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated.
