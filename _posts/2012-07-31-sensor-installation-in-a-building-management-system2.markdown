Building management systems BMSs are computer based control systems that are installed in buildings to monitor and manage environmental conditions and or the equipment in the building such as mechanical and electrical equipment e.g. lighting power ventilation and alarm systems . For example the building management system may control the heating and cooling of a building and the distribution of air throughout the building.

A building management system is typically comprised of a centralized BMS controller as well as a plurality of sensors distributed throughout the building. The installation of the sensors typically requires a technician to make a number of trips back and forth between the area where the sensor is being installed and the location of the BMS controller to install and configure the sensor and to verify that the sensor was successfully installed and is correctly reporting data. In addition the installation of a single sensor may require coordination among multiple technicians as several systems must be directly configured to work with the new sensor e.g. BMS hardware BMS software and possibly other software or hardware directly interfacing with the sensor .

A need therefore exists for more efficient and accurate techniques for installing a sensor in a building management system.

Generally methods and apparatus are provided for installing a sensor in a building management system. According to one aspect of the invention a sensor is installed in a building management system by determining a sensor type of the sensor from among a plurality of supported sensor types based on information collected by a mobile device of a user identifying configuration information required by the building management system for the determined sensor type obtaining the required configuration information from the user using an interface on the mobile device wherein at least a portion of the interface is generated to accommodate one or more requirements of the building management system with respect to the determined sensor type and providing the obtained required configuration information to the building management system.

According to further aspects of the invention some of the required configuration information for the determined sensor type can be automatically populated using default information for the determined sensor type. In addition the user can optionally be prompted to connect the sensor to the building management system.

Another aspect of the invention provides a sensor installation and verification software application. The sensor installation and verification software application is optionally installed on a smart phone. In addition the sensor installation and verification software application optionally communicates with the building management system.

A more complete understanding of the present invention as well as further features and advantages of the present invention will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.

The present invention provides more efficient and accurate methods and apparatus for installing a sensor in a building management system. The present invention recognizes that buildings often have a number of different systems e.g. electrical security HVAC and building management software each with different individuals responsible for individual components as well as various types of sensors. The installation of a sensor requires diverse skillsets and expertise and typically involves physical installation tasks e.g. installing the physical sensor and connecting wires for data and electricity configuration tasks in software potentially involving more than one software system and verification and or troubleshooting.

According to one aspect of the invention a sensor installation and verification SIV software application is provided that can communicate with and configure a plurality of different sensor types by stepping a technician through the physical and logical sensor installation processes. In addition the SIV software application includes information about the building management system BMS configuration. In this manner the SIV software application can perform sensor configuration registration and verification with the BMS.

As discussed hereinafter a technician can utilize the SIV software application to enter logical information about the sensor into the BMS. The SIV software application also optionally sends the entered information along with other collected and or configured information to any other applications that may have registered an interest in knowing about sensor installations of the given type. The SIV software application allows sensors to be installed and verified without requiring the technician to go back and forth between the installation location the physical BMS the BMS software terminal and other areas.

The exemplary indoor environment of comprises a lobby reception area a number of offices an equipment room and a conference room. The exemplary indoor environment comprises a number of sensors through N distributed throughout the indoor environment for monitoring and or managing one or more environmental conditions and or equipment and other devices in the building. In addition a building management system BMS and an installation coordination server are located for example in an equipment room.

A technician not shown employs a smart phone to install one or more sensors such as an exemplary sensor . The exemplary smart phone has an installed sensor installation and verification SIV software application app . In another variation the sensor installation and verification software application is installed on a different device and the smart phone is capable of sending information to and receiving information from the sensor installation and verification software application . The smart phone communicates with the building management software via the SIV software application for example using a wireless connection . In one exemplary embodiment each sensor is uniquely identified for example using a scannable identifier such as an attached barcode not shown or a radio frequency identification RFID tag.

As shown in and as discussed further below in conjunction with the building management system comprises BMS software one or more BMS hardware controllers through M typically distributed around the building for example mounted on one or more walls of the building and a BMS hardware termination point that the BMS hardware controllers are wired into. The BMS hardware termination point can be positioned in an exemplary equipment room or anywhere in the building or remotely such as on a cloud. Generally the sensors get wired into the BMS hardware controllers in a known manner. There are typically a number of BMS hardware controllers for a given building or even for a given floor of a given building.

The functionality of the sensor installation and verification software application the BMS software and the installation coordination server is as discussed further below in conjunction with . Generally the sensor installation and verification software application executes on the smart phone or communicates with the smart phone and communicates with the installation coordination server . The SIV software application communicates with and configures a plurality of different types of sensors by stepping a technician through the physical and logical sensor installation processes. The SIV software application performs sensor installation and registration with the BMS and optionally with any other applications that have registered an interest in the particular sensor type. In addition the SIV software application can optionally also perform one or more of the following support functions tracking progress and current status of a sensor installation listing points of contact for various subsystems notifying stakeholders of sensor information providing facilities to calibrate installed sensors and supporting detailed logging of the activities performed during installation.

The BMS software provides a limited user interface UI for associating sensors with the BMS hardware controllers and for verifying that the BMS hardware controllers are receiving data from the sensors .

The installation coordination server maintains a list of fields that need to be filled out for the installation of different types of sensors e.g. temperature sensors and motion sensors . The list of fields may be BMS dependent. The installation coordination server optionally also maintains a list of possible default values for these fields input types and bounds on allowable values which may be BMS dependent . Once filled out the installation coordination server also maintains a repository of deployed sensors and associated data. The installation coordination server sends the data to the BMS and optionally to other applications registering a need to know about the sensors . The installation coordination server optionally also maintains a list of BMS hardware controllers and their locations within one or more buildings so technicians can query this information and are not required to memorize this information.

In one exemplary embodiment discussed further below in conjunction with a barcode generation application generates a unique barcode for each sensor . The barcode generation application may optionally be part of the sensor installation and verification software application .

As shown in the exemplary sensor installation process begins during step with the sensor installation and verification software application or a dedicated barcode generation application generating one or more barcodes . For example a technician can generate the barcodes prior to leaving to install a set of sensors . The barcode is a unique identifier at least within the environment of a given building management system . The barcode should be unique for a given BMS installation i.e. no two sensors known to the same BMS should have the same barcode . The identifiers can be for example sequential non repeating integers.

During step a technician installing a sensor applies a barcode to the sensor . During step the technician initiates the sensor installation and verification software application selecting for example an option to Install a new Sensor. 

The technician is prompted during step to identify for example the building floor and other relevant information regarding where the installation is taking place in sufficient detail to allow the sensor installation and verification software application to determine the closest BMS hardware controller for the technician to connect to.

The sensor installation and verification software application prompts the technician during step to take a picture of the barcode for example using the smart phone . Once the picture is taken the application can determine the unique identifier of the sensor being installed. If the sensor installation and verification software application is not running on a device that has a camera then the technician can enter the identifier.

During step the sensor installation and verification software application prompts the technician to specify the type of sensor being installed. This information may be specified for example by means of a drop down list populated with supported sensor types for the given BMS . In one implementation the sensor type could be populated automatically with the aid of computer vision if the technician takes a picture of the sensor and the sensor type is recognized from the image or if the unique identifier obtained in step also encodes the sensor type.

Once the sensor installation and verification software application identifies the type of sensor being installed the sensor installation and verification software application communicates during step with the installation coordination server to obtain a list of all required fields that need to be filled out by the technician for that particular sensor type and its associated BMS .

During step the technician is presented with a set of fields that need to be filled out or verified. If a given field can be filled out automatically such as location of sensor name of technician by virtue of log in time of day this is optionally done by the sensor installation and verification software application . For the location the sensor installation and verification software application can optionally present a map of the building and given that the sensor installation and verification software application already knows the region of the building where the installation is taking place for example by virtue of step the technician can further click on a precise location in the map for a more precise indication of the location. Further such fields may be available for review and modification by the technician . For some fields the default values may be specified by the installation coordination server .

Once the necessary information is completed the entered information is relayed to the installation coordination server during step .

The installation coordination server uses the provided information along with existing default values during step to communicate with the building management system and any third party software e.g. OSIsoft s PI System an enterprise infrastructure for managing sensed data and events that needs to be made aware of the sensor being installed without requiring the technician to have to log in and enter information separately into these various systems. Communication between the installation coordination server and the BMS or third party software will typically occur using well defined application programming interfaces APIs . In cases where such a well defined API does not exist the installation coordination server can make use of screen scraping and automation technology to operate the user interface of the BMS or third party software.

During step the technician is prompted to install the sensor and connect it to the BMS hardware controller .

The technician connects the sensor to the BMS hardware controller during step . During step the technician is optionally prompted to verify that an electrical signal is being sent from the sensor to the BMS hardware controller for example using a current clamp or another electronic device.

If the BMS hardware controller receives successful confirmation that the new sensor has been installed during step from the BMS and each application that has registered an interest in this sensor type the BMS hardware controller relays this confirmation to the sensor installation and verification software application on the smart phone . If a failure is encountered the installation coordination server can automatically and immediately notify any responsible parties as identified on system setup such as responsible parties identified for the building as a whole or for sensor installation of a given type of the condition e.g. via a page based on a pager schedule . Further the installation coordination server can provide diagnostic information to the sensor installation and verification software application which can then be presented to the technician as well as to any responsible parties.

In the case of a successful installation of the sensor the technician may be shown the live data collected by the sensor during step .

The sensor installation and verification software application optionally supports a guided verification procedure during step where a technician is instructed to perform a set of tests that verify correctness of the data reported by the sensor . In this case the technician initiates a test and potentially applies a stimulus e.g. in the case of a motion detector the sensor installation and verification software application may instruct the technician to have the room empty for two minutes followed by moving around the room for two minutes . The technician or the installation coordination server can monitor the sensor data stream to verify that expected sensor readings are observed. In the case of faulty sensor readings the sensor installation and verification software application can inform the technician and or some other responsible party of the result.
