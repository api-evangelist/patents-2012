The present invention relates to a novel secreted molecule identified herein as monocyte granulocyte and dendritic cell colony stimulating factor MGD CSF . It relates to the polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences of MGD CSF fusion molecules containing MGD CSF vectors host cells compositions and kits comprising MGD CSF and methods of using MGD CSF and related molecules to diagnose prevent determine the prognosis for and treat diseases including immune related diseases infectious diseases and cancer. MGD CSF is a splice variant of MCG34647 a gene with a previously unknown function.

Cells of the innate immune system such as monocytes macrophages natural killer NK cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils PMN are the first line defenders against cancer and infectious disease by nature of their phagocytic cytolytic and antimicrobial properties. Monocytes and macrophages are believed to play an important role in inflammatory diseases through their activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators. For example granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF is known to promote proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes monocytes and macrophages. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF is known to promote the differentiation and growth of granulocytes and neutrophils Ogawa 81 3844 2853 1993 . At present both G CSF and GM CSF are being used as protein therapeutics to promote the recovery of blood cells after chemotherapy radiation and bone marrow transplants.

NK cells are known to play a role in host responses to cancer. In both syngeneic and xenogenic transplant models tumor cells grow more efficiently in NK mice and survival rates for the mice in these models are significantly less than those for mice possessing NK cells. In addition potentiating an NK response with soluble protein factors such as IL 2 or IL 15 has been shown to increase the efficiency by which NK cells kill tumor cells in the presence of anti tumor antibodies both in vitro and in vivo Carson et al. 180 1395 1403 1994 .

Additionally NK cells are also known to play a role in host response to infectious disease. For example mice lacking NK cells are known to have increased susceptibility to viruses and intracellular pathogens. Similarly humans with naturally occurring NK cell deficiencies are also known to be highly susceptible to infections. In vitro NK mediated killing of cells infected with virus or other intracellular pathogens is known to be potentiated by cytokines such as interferon interferon interleukin 12 and interleukin 18 Wu et al. 90 127 2003 Biron et al. 17 189 1999 Naume et al. 40 128 1994 .

It is also known that activated NK cells can be correlated with failure rates for women undergoing in vitro fertilization IVF procedures and may be further linked to spontaneous pregnancy loss Dosiou et al. 26 44 2005 . Additionally elevated levels of activated NK cells may be found in a number of patients with immune endometriosis one known underlying cause of infertility in women Dosiou et al. 26 44 2005 .

Antigen processing dendritic cells are capable of sensitizing T cells to both new and recall antigens. Dendritic cells express high levels of major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens which play a role in cancer immunotherapy along with other immunomodulatory proteins adhesins and cytokines. Dendritic cell cancer vaccines have been reported to be produced by extracting a patient s dendritic cells and using immune cell stimulants to reproduce large amounts of dendritic cells in vitro or ex vivo. The dendritic cells can then be exposed to antigens from the patient s cancer cells. The combination of dendritic cells and antigens is injected into the patient and the dendritic cells program the patient s T cells. Dendritic cells break down the antigens on the cancer cell surfaces then display them to killer T cells. Song et al. 45 Suppl. 48 52 2004 .

Cancer patients recovering from autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation exhibit decreased levels of circulating dendritic cells. Dendritic cells develop from hematopoietic progenitors and promoting their development may help regain normal dendritic cell levels. The ability to generate dendritic cells by inducing proliferation of isolated human dendritic cells and inducing proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells facilitates efficacy tests of dendritic cell vaccination and facilitates effective vaccination practice. There is a need in the art for factors that stimulate dendritic cell proliferation and or hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and or differentiation to dendritic cells. There is also a need in the art for factors that promote the generation of dendritic cells from hematopoietic cells to increase circulating dendritic cells in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Osteoclasts share a common progenitor with dendritic cells macrophages and microglia Servet Delprat et al. 3 15 2002 . These multinucleated adherent bone resorbing cells differentiate in the bone marrow and function in the vicinity of the bone to regulate bone remodeling and calcium homeostasis. Osteoclast differentiation and function has been reported to be regulated by secreted factors including M CSF and osteoprotegerin RANK ligand Miyamoto et al. 52 1 7 2003 . Factors which play a role in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function may be therapeutic in treating osteoporosis and other bone diseases.

Microglial cells function as immune effectors of the central nervous system where they also produce neurotrophic factors and regulate glutamate uptake. These mononuclear phagocytes are distributed throughout the central nervous system parenchyma in both the white and grey matter. Microglia have been reported to be present in increased numbers in patients with Alzheimer s disease wherein they display marked increases in nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines including IL 1 and MIP1 alpha Vincent et al. 23 349 362 2002 . Factors that regulate microglial differentiation and function may be therapeutic in treating Alzheimer s disease and other neural diseases including demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis acute disseminated encephalomyelopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy stroke and Parkinson s disease.

Gene MGC34647 encodes the hypothetical protein NP689669 Strausberg et al. 99 16 899 2002 . The functions of this gene and its encoded polypeptides are previously unknown. The sequences of MGC34647 and NP689669 correspond to SEQ ID. NOS. 49 and 103 respectively of WO 2002 048337. They correspond to the amino acid sequence of a secreted protein of unknown function and its coding sequence respectively.

Current therapies for immune diseases cancer infectious diseases and immune mediated recurrent pregnancy loss are inadequate insufficient and often toxic. Novel therapeutic compounds and therapies that increase the efficacy of the innate immune response to these conditions can provide more efficient therapy and may have a better therapeutic index than current therapies.

MGD CSF promotes the proliferation survival and or differentiation of monocytes granulocytes dendritic cells and NK cells. Therefore MGD CSF finds use as a protein therapeutic for treating cancers through its ability to stimulate the proliferation and or activation of immune cells such as NK cells monocytes macrophages granulocytes and dendritic cells to fight tumor cells. MGD CSF may be used alone or in combination with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for example Rituxan to treat cancer since MGD CSF may promote antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells monocytes or granulocytes. MGD CSF can also be used as an antagonistic therapeutic protein to effect hematopoietic regeneration adjunctive to chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. It can further be used to expand the number of dendritic cells in vivo or ex vivo. In addition MGD CSF may be useful as an anti infectious agent in the treatment of infectious diseases such as those caused by bacteria or viruses for example hepatitis C virus HCV or human immunodeficiency virus HIV .

MGD CSF promotes the proliferation and or the differentiation of immune cells and thus finds use in treating immune diseases. It may play a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmune diseases. MGD CSF antagonists may be developed as therapeutics for treating immune diseases. Antagonists may include monoclonal antibodies against MGD CSF MGD CSF receptor s including soluble receptors non functional mutants antisense DNA and RNAi.

Within the promoter sequence may be a transcription initiation site as well as protein binding domains consensus sequences responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. Eukaryotic promoters will often but not always contain TATA boxes and CAT boxes. Promoters include those that are naturally contiguous to a nucleic acid molecule and those that are not naturally contiguous to a nucleic acid molecule. Additionally the term promoter includes inducible promoters conditionally active promoters such as a cre lox promoter constitutive promoters and tissue specific promoters.

 Operably linked refers to an arrangement of elements wherein the components so described are configured so as to perform their desired function. Thus a secretory leader sequence operably linked to a polypeptide sequence is capable of effecting the secretion of the polypeptide from the cell.

 Transfected means possessing introduced DNA or RNA with or without the use of any accompanying facilitating agents such as lipofectamine. Methods for transfection that are known in the art include calcium phosphate transfection DEAE dextran transfection protoplast fusion electroporation and lipofection.

 Expression of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the conversion of the information contained in the nucleic acid molecule into a gene product. The gene product can be the direct transcriptional product of a gene e.g. mRNA tRNA rRNA antisense RNA ribozyme structural RNA or any other type of RNA or a peptide or polypeptide produced by translation of an mRNA. Gene products also include RNAs which are modified by processes such as capping polyadenylation methylation and editing and proteins modified by for example methylation acetylation phosphorylation ubiquitination ADP ribosylation myristilation and glycosylation.

A vector is an agent typically a virus or a plasmid which can be used to transfer genetic material to a cell or organism.

A host cell is an individual cell or a cell culture which can be or has been a recipient of any recombinant vector s or isolated polynucleotide s . Host cells include progeny of a single host cell and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in total DNA complement to the original parent cell due to natural accidental or deliberate mutation and or change. A host cell includes cells transfected or infected in vivo or in vitro with a recombinant vector or a polynucleotide of the invention. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention may be called a recombinant host cell. 

A stem cell is an undifferentiated pluripotent or multipotent cell with the ability to self renew to remain undifferentiated and to become differentiated. Stem cells can divide without limit at least for the lifetime of the animal in which they naturally reside. Stem cells are not terminally differentiated meaning they are not at the end of a differentiation pathway. When a stem cell divides each daughter cell can either remain a stem cell or it can embark on a course that leads to terminal differentiation. A stem cell can be an embryonic stem cell a juvenile stem cell or an adult stem cell. A hematopoeitic stem cell is involved in the process of hematopoeisis which is the process of forming mature blood cells from precursor cells.

The terms polypeptide and protein are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues and are not limited to a minimum length. Thus peptides oligopeptides dimers multimers and the like are included within the definition. Both full length proteins and fragments thereof are encompassed by the definition. The terms also include post expression modifications of the polypeptide for example glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation and the like. Furthermore for purposes of the present invention a polypeptide refers to a protein which includes modifications such as deletions additions and substitutions generally conservative in nature to the native sequence as long as the protein maintains the desired activity. These modifications may be deliberate as through site directed mutagenesis or may be accidental such as through mutations of hosts which produce the proteins or errors due to PCR amplification.

A leader sequence comprises a sequence of amino acid residues beginning at amino acid residue 1 which is located at the amino terminus of the polypeptide and extending to a cleavage site which upon proteolytic cleavage results in formation of a mature protein. Leader sequences are generally hydrophobic and have some positively charged residues. Leader sequences can be natural or synthetic heterologous or homologous with the protein to which they are attached. A secretory leader is a leader sequence that directs a protein to be secreted from the cell.

A fusion partner is a polypeptide fused in frame at the N terminus and or C terminus of a therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide or internally to a therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide.

The term receptor refers to a polypeptide that binds to a specific ligand. The ligand is usually an extracellular molecule which upon binding to the receptor usually initiates a cellular response such as initiation of a signal transduction pathway. A soluble receptor is a receptor that lacks a membrane anchor domain such as a transmembrane domain. A soluble receptor may include naturally occurring splice variants of a wild type transmembrane protein receptor in which the transmembrane domain is spliced out. A soluble receptor may include the extracellular domain or any fragment of the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein receptor. Soluble receptors can modulate a target protein. They can for example compete with wild type receptors for ligand binding and participate in ligand receptor interactions thus modulating the activity of or the number of the receptors and or the cellular activity downstream from the receptors. This modulation may trigger intracellular responses for example signal transduction events which activate cells signal transduction events which inhibit cells or events that modulate cellular growth proliferation differentiation and or death or induce the production of other factors that in turn mediate such activities.

An isolated purified substantially isolated or substantially pure molecule such as a polypeptide or polynucleotide is one that has been manipulated to exist in a higher concentration than in nature. For example a subject antibody is isolated purified substantially isolated or substantially purified when at least 10 or 20 or 40 or 50 or 70 or 90 of non subject antibody materials with which it is associated in nature have been removed. As used herein an isolated purified substantially isolated or substantially purified molecule includes recombinant molecules.

A biologically active entity or an entity having biological activity is one having structural regulatory or biochemical functions of a naturally occurring molecule or any function related to or associated with a metabolic or physiological process. Biologically active polynucleotide fragments are those exhibiting activity similar but not necessarily identical to an activity of a polynucleotide of the present invention. The biological activity can include an improved desired activity or a decreased undesirable activity. For example an entity demonstrates biological activity when it participates in a molecular interaction with another molecule such as hybridization when it has therapeutic value in alleviating a disease condition when it has prophylactic value in inducing an immune response when it has diagnostic and or prognostic value in determining the presence of a molecule such as a biologically active fragment of a polynucleotide that can for example be detected as unique for the polynucleotide molecule or that can be used as a primer in a polymerase chain reaction. A biologically active polypeptide or fragment thereof includes one that can participate in a biological reaction including but not limited to one that can serve as an epitope or immunogen to stimulate an immune response such as production of antibodies or that can participate in modulating the immune response.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably to refer to a protein for example one generated by the immune system synthetically or recombinantly that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Antibodies are commonly known in the art. Antibodies may recognize polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens. The term includes active fragments including for example an antigen binding fragment of an immunoglobulin a variable and or constant region of a heavy chain a variable and or constant region of a light chain a complementarity determining region cdr and a framework region. The terms include polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies altered antibodies chimeric antibodies hybrid antibody molecules F ab and F ab fragments Fv molecules for example noncovalent heterodimers dimeric and trimeric antibody fragment constructs minibodies humanized antibody molecules and any functional fragments obtained from such molecules wherein such fragments retain specific binding.

A vaccine is a preparation that produces or artificially increases immunity to a particular disease. It may for example be comprised of killed microorganisms living attenuated organisms or living virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease. It includes a preparation containing weakened or dead microbes of the kind that cause a particular disease administered to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against that disease. The term includes nucleic acid and polypeptide vaccines.

The term binds specifically in the context of antibody binding refers to high avidity and or high affinity binding of an antibody to a specific epitope. Hence an antibody that binds specifically to one epitope a first epitope and not to another a second epitope is a specific antibody. An antibody specific to a first epitope may cross react with and bind to a second epitope if the two epitopes share homology or other similarity. The term binds specifically in the context of a polynucleotide refers to hybridization under stringent conditions. Conditions that increase stringency of both DNA DNA and DNA RNA hybridization reactions are widely known and published in the art . John Wiley Sons 2001 .

The terms subject individual host and patient are used interchangeably herein to refer to a living animal including a human and a non human animal. The subject may for example be an organism possessing immune cells capable of responding to antigenic stimulation and stimulatory and inhibitory signal transduction through cell surface receptor binding. The subject may be a mammal such as a human or non human mammal for example dogs cats pigs cows sheep goats horses rats and mice. The term subject does not preclude individuals that are entirely normal with respect to a disease or normal in all respects.

A patient sample is any biological specimen derived from a patient. The term includes but is not limited to biological fluids such as blood serum plasma urine cerebrospinal fluid tears saliva lymph dialysis fluid lavage fluid semen and other liquid samples as well as cell and tissues of biological origin. The term also includes cells or cells derived therefrom and the progeny thereof including cells in culture cell supernatants and cell lysates. It further includes organ or tissue culture derived fluids tissue biopsy samples tumor biopsy samples stool samples and fluids extracted from physiological tissues as well as cells dissociated from solid tissues tissue sections and cell lysates. This definition encompasses samples that have been manipulated in any way after their procurement such as by treatment with reagents solubilization or enrichment for certain components such as polynucleotides or polypeptides. Also included in the term are derivatives and fractions of patient samples. A patient sample may be used in a diagnostic prognostic or other monitoring assay.

A disease is a pathological condition for example one that can be identified by symptoms or other identifying factors as diverging from a healthy or a normal state. The term disease includes disorders syndromes conditions and injuries. Diseases include but are not limited to proliferative inflammatory immune metabolic infectious and ischemic diseases.

The term modulate refers to the production either directly or indirectly of an increase or a decrease a stimulation inhibition interference or blockage in a measured activity when compared to a suitable control. A modulator of a polypeptide or polynucleotide or an agent are terms used interchangeably herein to refer to a substance that affects for example increases decreases stimulates inhibits interferes with or blocks a measured activity of the polypeptide or polynucleotide when compared to a suitable control.

 Preventing as used herein includes providing prophylaxis with respect to the occurrence or recurrence of a disease in a subject that may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed with the disease. Treatment and prophylaxis can be administered to an organism including a human or to a cell in vivo in vitro or ex vivo and the cell subsequently administered the subject.

 Treatment as used herein covers any administration or application of remedies for disease in a mammal including a human and includes inhibiting the disease. It includes arresting disease development and relieving the disease such as by causing regression or restoring or repairing a lost missing or defective function or stimulating an inefficient process.

A carrier refers to a solid semisolid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material formulation auxiliary or excipient of any conventional type. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier refers to a non toxic carrier. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be for example vehicles adjuvants or diluents.

The invention provides a novel isolated secreted molecule identified herein as monocyte granulocyte and dendritic cell colony stimulating factor MGD CSF . The invention provides methods of using MGD CSF as well as related factors which include variants and mutants of MGD CSF. MGD CSF is related to NP689669 Molecular Genomics Clone MGC34647 and Incyte SEQ. ID. NOS. 232 255 and 257 WO 2002 048337 as further described below.

MGD CSF is 241 amino acids in length and comprises a signal peptide or secretory leader sequence. MGD CSF is a subclone derived from the mother clone CLN00506579 in clone family CLN00212388. MGD CSF belongs to Five Prime s cluster 190647. This cluster of secreted proteins includes all expressed sequences representing a single gene. Its status as a secreted molecule is confirmed by its Treevote of 0.92. The Treevote is the result of an algorithm constructed on the basis of a number of physical and chemical attributes that predicts whether a predicted amino acid sequence is secreted a Treevote greater than 0.50 is indicative of a secreted molecule.

As shown in MGD CSF is related to a hypothetical protein predicted to be encoded by the mRNA sequence of NP689669 as designated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI Strausberg et al. 99 16 899 2002 . This hypothetical human protein is predicted to comprise 242 amino acids. The coding sequence for NP689669 has been described by the National Institutes of Health s Mammalian Gene Collection MGC as MCG34647. The nucleic acid sequences of MGC34647 correspond to SEQ ID. NOS. 49 and 103 respectively as designated in WO 2002 048337 wherein SEQ. ID. NO. 49 was described as secreted protein of unknown function encoded by SEQ. ID. NO. 103. The functions of MGC34647 and NP 689669 were heretofore undisclosed. MGD CSF is a novel splice variant of MGC34647. The junction between exon 3 and exon 4 is differentially spliced such that amino acid L80 is followed by R81.

Gene MGC34647 is predicted to encode a protein with an open reading frame of 242 amino acids with a nucleic acid coding sequence 729 nucleotides in length. The proprotein is predicted to weigh 27 479 daltons and have an isoelectric point of 7.72. Following cleavage of a signal peptide which comprises amino acids 1 20 the mature protein is predicted to weigh 25 229 daltons and have an isoelectric point of 6.74. This mature protein is predicted to be 222 amino acids long encoded by a nucleic acid molecule of 669 nucleotides. MGC34647 has six exons. It maps to the genome on chromosome 16q22.1 from the start position of 70456649 to the stop position of 70470765.

MGC34647 expression has been observed in spleen parotid gland joint meniscus bile duct seminal vesicle medulla oblongata pituitary gland salivary gland and the Sequence Listing as further described below. Based on these localizations MGC34647 is predicted to have several specific therapeutic uses. It may be the target of an antagonistic antibody for autoimmune diseases for example multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE . It may for example be used as a protein therapeutic agonist for hematopoietic cell regeneration during chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant as an antagonistic protein therapeutic to enhance cell mediated immunity for treating infectious diseases or as a protein therapeutic antagonist for cytoprotection.

The present invention provides nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide sequence corresponding to the novel MGD CSF sequences as set forth in the Tables and Sequence Listing for example SEQ. ID. NOS. 1. 2 3 and 5. The invention provides uses for these nucleic acid molecules and for related nucleic acid molecules such as those shown in SEQ. ID. NOS. 4 and 13. These uses are described herein.

The invention provides a DNA molecule that contains a promoter of a liver expressed gene operably linked to a gene encoding MGD CSF or NP688669 and that can be expressed in vivo to produce a protein that is functionally active. DNA molecules as described have a variety of uses for example as tools in basic research to study the in vivo function of an artificially introduced MGD CSF or NP688669 the interaction of more than one artificially introduced MGD CSF or NP688669 the in vivo dynamics of artificially introduced MGD CSF or NP688669 fusion proteins or to identify the in vivo targets of an artificially introduced MGD CSF or NP688669 protein and as therapeutic treatments as further described below.

Non limiting embodiments of nucleic acid molecules include genes or gene fragments exons introns mRNA tRNA rRNA siRNA ribozymes antisense cDNA recombinant polynucleotides branched polynucleotides plasmids vectors isolated DNA of any sequence isolated RNA of any sequence nucleic acid probes and primers. Nucleic acid molecules include splice variants of an mRNA. Nucleic acids can be naturally occurring for example DNA or RNA or can be synthetic analogs as known in the art. Such analogs demonstrate stability under assay conditions thus they are suitable as probes. A nucleic acid molecule can also comprise modified nucleic acid molecules such as methylated nucleic acid molecules and nucleic acid molecule analogs. Analogs of purines and pyrimidines are known in the art.

Nucleic acids of the invention are useful as hybridization probes for differential identification of the tissue s or cell type s present in a biological sample. Fragments of the full length MGD CSF variant may be used as hybridization probes for cDNA libraries to isolate the full length gene and to isolate other genes which have a high sequence similarity or a similar biological activity. Probes of this type can have at least 30 bases and may comprise for example 50 or more bases. The probe may also be used in a screening procedure to identify a cDNA clone corresponding to a full length transcript and a genomic clone or clones that contain complete MGD CSF genes including regulatory and promoter regions exons and introns. An example of such a screen would include isolating the coding regions of MGD CSF genes by using a known nucleic acid sequence to synthesize an oligonucleotide probe. Labeled oligonucleotides having a sequence complementary to a gene of the present invention can be used to screen a human cDNA a genomic DNA or a mRNA library to identify complementary library components.

The present invention further relates to polynucleotides which hybridize to the hereinabove described sequences if there is at least 91 at least 92 or at least 95 identity between the sequences. The present invention relates to polynucleotides which hybridize under stringent conditions to the hereinabove described polynucleotides. Stringent conditions generally include condition under which hybridization will occur only if there is at least 95 or at least 97 identity between the sequences. For example overnight incubation at 42 C. in a solution containing 50 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 g ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 0.1 SSC at about 65 C. constitute stringent conditions.

The polynucleotides which hybridize to the polynucleotides shown in the Tables and Sequence Listing can encode polypeptides which retain substantially the same biological function or activity as the mature polypeptide. Alternatively a polynucleotide may have at least 20 bases at least 30 bases or at least 50 bases which hybridize to a polynucleotide of the present invention and which has an identity thereto and which may or may not retain the same biological function or activity as the mature polypeptide. Thus the present invention is directed to polynucleotides having at least a 70 identity at least an 80 identity at least a 90 identity or at least a 95 identity to a polynucleotide which encodes the polypeptides set forth in the Sequence Listing as well as fragments thereof which fragments have at least 30 bases or at least 50 bases and to polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides.

Using the information provided herein such as the nucleotide sequences set forth in the Tables and Sequence Listing nucleic acid molecules of the present invention encoding a MGD CSF polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material.

The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode portions analogs or derivatives of the MGD CSF molecules. Variants may occur naturally such as a natural allelic variant such as one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism as described in for example Lewin B. ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1985 . Non naturally occurring variants may be produced using mutagenesis techniques known in the art.

Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions deletions or additions. The substitutions deletions or additions may involve one or more nucleotides. The variants may be altered in coding regions non coding regions or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non conservative amino acid substitutions deletions or additions. These may take the form of silent substitutions additions or deletions which do not alter the properties or activities of the described MGD CSF proteins or portions thereof.

In an embodiment the invention provides nucleic acid molecules encoding mature proteins including those with cleaved signal peptide or leader sequences for example as shown in the Sequence Listing. Other embodiments include an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 70 identical at least 80 identical at least 90 identical or at least 95 identical to a polynucleotide from the Sequence Listing a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide shown in the Sequence Listing a polypeptide shown in the Sequence Listing or a biologically active fragment of any of these.

A polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a MGD CSF polypeptide is one in which the nucleotide sequence is identical to the reference sequence except that it may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5 or 3 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to for instance the nucleotide sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group Madison Wis. . Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.

The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to the nucleic acid sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF activity. Even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF activity one of skill in the art would know how to use the nucleic acid molecule for instance as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction PCR primer. Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF activity include inter alia isolating the MGD CSF gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library and in situ hybridization for example fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide the precise chromosomal location of the MGD CSF genes as described in Verna et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 and Northern blot analysis for detecting MGD CSF mRNA expression in specific tissues.

The present application is also directed to nucleic acid molecules having sequences at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to a nucleic acid sequence of the Sequence Listing which encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF polypeptide activity that is a polypeptide exhibiting activity either identical to or similar to an activity of the MGD CSF polypeptides of the invention as measured in a particular biological assay. For example the MGD CSF polypeptides of the present invention may stimulate immune cell proliferation inhibit tumor growth and or kill tumor cells.

Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in the Sequence Listing will encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF polypeptide activity. In fact since multiple degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences encode the same polypeptide this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing the above described comparison assay. It will be further recognized in the art that a reasonable number of nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants will also encode a polypeptide having MGD CSF polypeptide activity the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly affect protein function for example replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid as further described below.

The present invention also relates to vectors which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors and the production of MGD CSF polypeptides or fragments thereof by recombinant techniques. It provides recombinant vectors that contain for example nucleic acid constructs that encode secretory leader sequences see for example the Sequence Listing the secretory leader may be a collagen secretory leader and a selected heterologous polypeptide of interest and host cells that are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors. The vector may be for example a phage plasmid or viral vector. Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells. Vectors of the invention may contain Kozak sequences Lodish et al. 4ed. 1999 . Vectors of the invention may also contain the ATG start codon of the sequence of interest.

The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate such as a calcium phosphate precipitate or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.

The DNA insert can be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter such as the phage lambda PL promoter the lac trp phoA and tac promoters the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation termination and in the transcribed region a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs can include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon UAA UGA or UAG appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.

The invention provides the expression of genes of interest in animals including humans under the control of a promoter that functions inter alia in the liver. The hydrodynamics based procedure of tail vein injection Zhang et al. 10 1735 1999 has been demonstrated to transfect cells with a gene of interest. The invention also provides for the manipulation of the level of gene expression by controlling the amount and frequency of intravascular DNA administration. The invention further provides promoters that function to express genes in the liver.

One large family of proteins expressed in the liver is the cytochrome P450 protein family. These proteins are a group of heme thiolate monooxygenases that perform a variety of oxidation reactions often as part of the body s mechanism to dispose of harmful substances by making them more water soluble. Much of the body s total mass of cytochrome P450 proteins is found in the liver specifically in the microsomes of hepatocytes. There are over a thousand different cytochrome P450 proteins. However only 49 genes and 15 pseudogenes have been sequenced in humans. In humans cytochrome P450 3A4 has been identified as the most important cytochrome P450 protein in oxidative metabolism. It is the most prevalent cytochrome P450 protein in the body and is an inducible protein.

Operably linking the promoter sequence of genes expressed in the liver for example the promoter sequence of any of the cytochrome P450 proteins to a gene of interest can lead to expression of that gene in the liver and any other site where the promoter is active. The invention encompasses promoters that function to express genes including but not limited to cytochrome P450 gene such as cytochrome P450 3A4 c jun jun b c fos c myc serum amyloid A apolipoprotein B editing catalytic subunit liver regeneration factors such as LRF 1 signal transducers and activators of transcription such as STAT 3 serum alkaline phosphatase SAP insulin like growth factor binding proteins such as IGFBP 1 cyclin D1 active protein 1 CCAAT enhancer core binding protein beta ornithine decarbonylase phosphatase of regenerating liver 1 early growth response gene 1 hepatocyte growth factors hemopexin insulin like growth factors IGF such as IGF2 hepatocyte nuclear family 1 hepatocyte nuclear family 4 hepatocyte Arg Ser rich domain containing proteins glucose 6 phosphatase and acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid A and serum amyloid P SAA SAP .

As shown in Table 7 and Example 9 operably linking the promoter sequence of cytochrome P450 3A4 to MGD CSF and injecting resulting the construct into the tail vein of a mouse induces in the expression of MGD CSF and a concomitant increase in monocyte production by the mouse. Thus the invention provides therapeutic molecules of the invention delivered in vivo. This method can be used to deliver naked DNA in the presence or absence of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vector DNA with a sequence of interest. Methods of evaluating the function of the molecules of the invention delivered in vivo are known in the art and some are described herein.

As indicated the expression vectors may include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include but are not limited to bacterial cells such as and cells fungal cells such as yeast cells insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells animal cells such as CHO COS 293 and Bowes melanoma cells and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above described host cells are known in the art.

The selectable markers are genes that confer a phenotype on a cell expressing the marker so that the cell can be identified under appropriate conditions. Generally a selectable marker allows the selection of transformed cells based on their ability to thrive in the presence or absence of a chemical or other agent that inhibits an essential cell function. Suitable markers therefore include genes coding for proteins which confer drug resistance or sensitivity thereto impart color to or change the antigenic characteristics of those cells transfected with a molecule encoding the selectable marker when the cells are grown in an appropriate selective medium. For example selectable markers include cytotoxic markers and drug resistance markers whereby cells are selected by their ability to grow on media containing one or more of the cytotoxins or drugs auxotrophic markers by which cells are selected for their ability to grow on defined media with or without particular nutrients or supplements such as thymidine and hypoxanthine metabolic markers for which cells are selected for example their ability to grow on defined media containing the appropriate sugar as the sole carbon source and markers which confer the ability of cells to form colored colonies on chromogenic substrates or cause cells to fluoresce.

Among vectors suitable for use in bacteria include pQE70 pQE60 and pQE 9 available from Qiagen Mississauga Ontario Canada pBS vectors Phagescript vectors Bluescript vectors pNH8A pNH6a pNH18A pNH46A available from Stratagene La Jolla Calif. and ptrc99a pKK223 3 pKK233 3 pDR540 pRIT5 available from Pharmacia Peapack N.J. .

Other suitable vectors will be apparent to the skilled artisan.

Other suitable vectors include those employing a pTT vector backbone and Durocher et al. 30 2002 . Briefly the pTT vector backbone may be prepared by obtaining pIRESpuro EGFP pEGFP and pSEAP basic vector s for example from Clontech Palo Alto Calif. and pcDNA3.1 pcDNA3.1 Myc His 6 His tag disclosed as SEQ ID NO. 277 and pCEP4 vectors can be obtained from for example Invitrogen. As used herein the pTT5 backbone vector can generate pTT5 Gateway and be used to transiently express proteins in mammalian cells. The pTT5 vector can be derivatized to pTT5 A pTT5 B pTT5 D pTT5 E pTT5 H and pTT5 I for example. As used herein the pTT2 vector can generate constructs for stable expression in mammalian cell lines.

The expression vector pTT5 allows for extrachromosomal replication of the cDNA driven by a cytomegalovirus CMV promoter. The plasmid vector pcDNA pDEST40 is a Gateway adapted vector which can utilize a CMV promoter for high level expression. SuperGlo GFP variant sgGFP can be obtained from Q Biogene Carlsbad Calif. . Preparing a pCEP5 vector can be accomplished by removing the CMV promoter and polyadenylation signal of pCEP4 by sequential digestion and self ligation using SalI and XbaI enzymes resulting in plasmid pCEP4 . A GblII fragment from pAdCMV5 Massie et al. 72 2289 2296 1998 encoding the CMV5 poly A expression cassette ligated in BglII linearized pCEP4A resulting in pCEP5 vector.

The pTT vector can be prepared by deleting the hygromycin BsmI and SalI excision followed by fill in and ligation and EBNA1 ClaI and NsiI excision followed by fill in and ligation expression cassettes. The ColEI origin FspI SalI fragment including the 3 end of lactamase ORF can be replaced with a FspI SalI fragment from pcDNA3.1 containing the pMBI origin and the same 3 end of lactamase ORF . A Myc Hs 6 His tag disclosed as SEQ ID NO. 277 C terminal fusion tag can be added to SEAP HindIII HpaI fragment from pSEAP basic following in frame ligation in pcDNA3.1 Myc His digested with HindIII and EcoRV. Plasmids can subsequently be amplified in DH5a grown in LB medium and purified using MAXI prep columns Qiagen Mississauga Ontario Canada . To quantify plasmids can be subsequently diluted in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 and absorbencies can be measured at 260 nm and 280 nm. Plasmid preparations with A Aratios between about 1.75 and about 2.00 are suitable.

Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE dextran mediated transfection cationic lipid mediated transfection electroporation transduction infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals such as Sambrook J. et al. 2001 3ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

The polypeptides may be expressed in a modified form such as a fusion protein and may include not only secretion signals but also additional heterologous functional regions. For instance a region of additional amino acids particularly charged amino acids may be added to the N terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence in the host cell during purification or during subsequent handling and storage. Also peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide.

The invention further provides isolated MGD CSF polypeptides containing the amino acid sequences encoded by the nucleotide sequences set forth in the Tables and Sequence Listing for example SEQ. ID. NOS. 7 8 9 and 11 which correspond to the full length polypeptide exon 4 the mature polypeptide and the fragment TRLRAQ SEQ ID NO. 11 present at the junction between exon 3 and exon 4 of MGD CSF respectively. The invention provides novel uses for these novel polypeptides and for related polypeptides such as those shown in SEQ. ID. NOS. 10 and 12.

The invention provides secreted proteins which are capable of being directed to the ER secretory vesicles or the extracellular space as a result of a secretory leader signal peptide or leader sequence as well as proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If a secreted protein is released into the extracellular space it may undergo extracellular processing to a mature polypeptide. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage.

As shown in the MGD CSF polypeptides can be recovered and isolated from recombinant cell cultures by well known methods. Such methods include ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation acid extraction anion or cation exchange chromatography phosphocellulose chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography affinity chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High performance liquid chromatography HPLC can be employed for purification. Polypeptides of the present invention include products purified from natural sources including bodily fluids tissues and cells whether directly isolated or cultured products of chemical synthetic procedures and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host including for example bacterial yeast higher plant insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non glycosylated. In addition polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue in some cases as a result of host mediated processes. Thus it is well known in the art that the N terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in eukaryotic cells. While the N terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes for some proteins this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N terminal methionine is covalently linked.

Typically a heterologous polypeptide whether modified or unmodified may be expressed as described above or as a fusion protein and may include not only secretion signals but also a secretory leader sequence. A secretory leader sequence of the invention directs certain proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum ER . The ER separates the membrane bound proteins from other proteins. Once localized to the ER proteins can be further directed to the Golgi apparatus for distribution to vesicles including secretory vesicles the plasma membrane lysosomes and other organelles.

Proteins targeted to the ER by a secretory leader sequence can be released into the extracellular space as a secreted protein. For example vesicles containing secreted proteins can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space via exocytosis. Exocytosis can occur constitutively or upon receipt of a triggering signal. In the latter case the proteins may be stored in secretory vesicles or secretory granules until exocytosis is triggered. Similarly proteins residing on the cell membrane can also be secreted into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage of a linker holding the protein to the membrane.

Additionally peptide moieties and or purification tags may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion to improve stability and to facilitate purification among other reasons are familiar and routine techniques in the art. Suitable purification tags include for example V5 HISX6 SEQ ID NO. 277 HISX8 SEQ ID NO. 278 avidin and biotin.

The invention provides a fusion protein comprising a heterologous region from an immunoglobulin that is useful to stabilize and purify proteins. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion to improve stability and to facilitate purification among others are familiar and routine techniques in the art. For example EP 0 464 533 Canadian counterpart 2045869 discloses fusion proteins containing various portions of constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases the Fc part of a fusion protein is advantageous for use in therapy and diagnosis and thus results for example in improved pharmacokinetic properties EP 0 232 262 . On the other hand for some uses it would be desirable to be able to delete the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified in the advantageous manner described. This is the case when the Fc portion proves to be a hindrance to use in therapy and or diagnosis for example when the fusion protein is to be used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See Bennett et al. 8 52 58 1995 and Johanson et al 270 9459 9471 1995 .

The polypeptides of the present invention can be provided in an isolated form and can be substantially purified as described above. A recombinantly produced version of the herein described MGD CSF polypeptides can also be substantially isolated for example according to the one step method described in Smith and Johnson 67 31 40 1988 . Polypeptides of the invention can further be isolated from natural or recombinant sources using anti MGD CSF antibodies of the invention produced using methods well known in the art.

The polypeptides herein may be purified or isolated in the presence of ions or agents that aid in the refolding of the molecules or aid in dimerizing or trimerizing the molecules as conventional in the art. For example cofactors may be added to promote physiologic folding or multimerization.

Further polypeptides of the present invention include polypeptides which have at least 70 80 90 or 95 identity to those described above. The polypeptides of the invention also contain those which are at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid sequence of the Sequence Listing.

The identity of two polypeptides can be measured by a similarity score determined by comparing the amino acid sequences of the two polypeptides using the Bestfit program with the default settings for determining similarity. Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 to find the best segment of similarity between two sequences.

A polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence of a MGD CSF polypeptide is one in which the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference polypeptide. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid or a number of amino acids up to 5 of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least 70 80 90 or 95 identical to for instance an amino acid sequence or to a polypeptide sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence set forth in the Sequence Listing can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program. When using Bestfit or other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.

Protein engineering may be employed to improve or alter the characteristics of MGD CSF polypeptides of the invention. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show desirable properties such as enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide at least under certain purification and storage conditions.

For instance for many proteins including the extracellular domain of a membrane associated protein or the mature form s of a secreted protein it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N terminus or C terminus without substantial loss of biological function. For instance Ron et al. 268 2984 2988 1993 reported modified KGF proteins that had heparin binding activity even if 3 8 or 27 amino terminal amino acid residues were missing.

However even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other biological activities may still be retained. Thus the ability of the shortened protein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature from of the protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature protein are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of a complete protein retains such immunologic activities can be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequences of the MGD CSF molecules as shown in the Sequence Listing.

Similarly many examples of biologically functional C terminal deletion muteins are known. For instance interferon gamma increases in activity as much as ten fold when 8 10 amino acid residues are deleted from the carboxy terminus of the protein see for example Dobeli et al. 7 199 216 1988 .

However even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other biological activities may still be retained. Thus the ability of the shortened protein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature form of the protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature protein are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete protein retains such immunologic activities can be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.

The MGD CSF sequence includes seven cysteine residues located at amino acid positions 35 167 176 178 179 190 and 198. In an embodiment the invention provides mutant MGC34647 molecules with serine mutated to cysteine. These mutants are shown in Table 1 and in the Sequence Listing designated SEQ. ID. NOS. 258 271. The collagen signal peptide described by SEQ. ID. NO. 14 was used to improve the secretion of the expressed polypeptide. As set forth in Table 1 and and explained in more detail in Example 18 the cysteines at positions 35 167 176 178 179 190 and 198 were each substituted for serine. These constructs may be cloned into any suitable vector as known in the art for example the pTT5 G vector.

Analyzing these muteins provides an understanding of the disulfide bond pattern of MGD CSF and may identify a protein with improved properties for example improved expression and secretion from mammalian cells decreased aggregation of the purified protein and the potential to produce active recombinant MGD CSF when expressed in

In addition to terminal deletion forms of the protein discussed above it also will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that some amino acid sequences of the MGD CSF polypeptides can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity.

Thus the invention further includes variations of the MGD CSF polypeptides which show substantial MGD CSF polypeptide activity or which include regions of the MGD CSF proteins such as the protein portions discussed below. Such mutants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and type substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al. 247 1306 1310 1990 wherein the authors indicate that there are two main approaches for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change. The first method relies on the process of evolution in which mutations are either accepted or rejected by natural selection. The second approach uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene and selections or screens to identify sequences that maintain functionality.

These studies report that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at a certain position of the protein. For example most buried amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved. Other such phenotypically silent substitutions are described in Bowie et al. supra and the references cited therein. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements one for another among the aliphatic amino acids Ala Val Leu and Ile interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr exchange of the acidic residues Asp and Glu substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gln exchange of the basic residues Lys and Arg and replacements between the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr.

Thus a fragment derivative or analog of a polypeptide of the Sequence Listing or polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid sequence of the Sequence Listing may be i one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue such a substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code ii one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group iii one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or iv one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the above form of the polypeptide such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide a leader or secretory sequence a sequence employed to purify the above form of the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

Thus the MGD CSF polypeptides of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation. As indicated these changes may be of a minor nature such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein. Conservative amino acid substitutions include the aromatic substitutions Phe Trp and Tyr the hydrophobic substitutions Leu Iso and Val the polar substitutions Glu and Asp the basic substitutions Arg Lys and His the acidic substitutions Asp and Glu and the small amino acid substations Ala Ser Thr Met and Gly.

Amino acids essential for the functions of MGD CSF polypeptides can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis see for example Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro or in vitro proliferative activity.

Of special interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids which may produce proteins with highly desirable improved characteristics such as less aggregation. Aggregation may not only reduce activity but also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because for example aggregates can be immunogenic Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

Replacing amino acids can also change the selectivity of the binding of a ligand to cell surface receptors. For example Ostade et al. 361 266 268 1993 describes mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling for example Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 .

As described in detail below the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to raise polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies which are useful in assays for detecting MGD CSF protein expression also as described below or as agonists and or antagonists capable of enhancing or inhibiting MGD CSF protein function. These polypeptides can also be used in a yeast two hybrid system to capture MGD CSF protein binding proteins which are also candidate agonists and antagonists according to the present invention. The yeast two hybrid system is described in Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 .

In another aspect the invention provides a polypeptide comprising one or more epitope bearing portion of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides polyclonal antibodies specific to MGD CSF and provides that MGD CSF has at minimum two antigenic epitopes. The epitope of this polypeptide portion is an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide of the invention. Immunogenic epitopes are those parts of a protein that elicit an antibody response when the whole protein is provided as the immunogen. On the other hand a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is an antigenic epitope. The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See for instance Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1983 .

As to the selection of polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope that is those which contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See for instance Sutcliffe et al. 219 660 666 1983 . Peptides capable of eliciting protein reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins that is to immunogenic epitopes nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are therefore useful for raising antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to a polypeptide of the invention. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 . The epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention may be produced by any conventional means. See for example Houghten 82 5131 5135 1985 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 1986 .

Epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention can be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. See for instance Bittle et al 66 2347 2354 1985 . Immunogenic epitope bearing peptides of the invention those parts of a protein that elicit an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen are identified according to methods known in the art. See for instance U.S. Pat. No. 5 194 392 1990 which describes a general method of detecting or determining the sequence of monomers amino acids or other compounds which is a topological equivalent of the epitope mimotope which is complementary to a particular antigen binding site paratope of an antibody of interest. More generally U.S. Pat. No. 4 433 092 1989 describes a method of detecting or determining a sequence of monomers which is a topographical equivalent of a ligand which is complementary to the ligand binding site of a particular receptor of interest. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 5 480 971 1996 discloses linear C1 C7 alkyl peralkylated oligopeptides and sets and libraries of such peptides as well as methods for using such oligopeptide sets and libraries for determining the sequence of a peralkylated oligopeptide that for example binds to an acceptor molecule of interest. Thus non peptide analogs of the epitope bearing peptides of the invention also can be made routinely by these methods.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate MGD CSF polypeptides of the present invention and the epitope bearing fragments thereof described above can be combined with heterologous polypeptides resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. This has been reported for example in chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins for example EP 0 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric MGD CSF protein or protein fragment alone for example as described by Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Suitable chemical moieties for derivatization of a heterologous polypeptide include for example polymers such as water soluble polymers the constant domain of immunoglobulins all or part of human serum albumin fetuin A fetuin B a leucine zipper domain a tetranectin trimerization domain mannose binding protein also known as mannose binding lectin for example mannose binding protein 1 and an Fc region as described herein and further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 686 179 and U.S. Application Nos. 60 589 788 and 60 654 229. Methods of making fusion proteins are well known to the skilled artisan.

For example the short plasma half life of unmodified interferon alpha makes frequent dosing necessary over an extended period of time in order to treat viral and proliferative disorders. Interferon alpha fused with HSA has a longer half life and requires less frequent dosing than unmodified interferon alpha the half life was 18 fold longer and the clearance rate was approximately 140 times slower Osborn et al. 303 540 548 2002 . Interferon beta fused with HSA also has favorable pharmacokinetic properties its half life was reported to be 36 40 hours compared to 8 hours for unmodified interferon beta Sung et al. 23 25 36 2003 . A HSA interleukin 2 fusion protein has been reported to have both a longer half life and favorable biodistribution compared to unmodified interleukin 2. This fusion protein was observed to target tissues where lymphocytes reside to a greater extent than unmodified interleukin 2 suggesting that it exerts greater efficacy Yao et al. 53 404 410 2004 .

The Fc receptor of human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 has also been used as a fusion partner for a therapeutic molecule. It has been recombinantly linked to two soluble p75 tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor molecules. This fusion protein has been reported to have a longer circulating half life than monomeric soluble receptors and to inhibit TNF induced proinflammatory activity in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis Goldenberg 21 75 87 1999 . This fusion protein has been used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis juvenile rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis Nanda and Bathon 5 1175 1186 2004 .

Polymers for example water soluble polymers are useful in the present invention as the polypeptide to which each polymer is attached will not precipitate in an aqueous environment such as typically found in a physiological environment. Polymers employed in the invention will be pharmaceutically acceptable for the preparation of a therapeutic product or composition. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer based on such considerations as whether the polymer protein conjugate will be used therapeutically and if so the desired dosage circulation time and resistance to proteolysis.

Suitable clinically acceptable water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol monomethoxy polyethylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol PVA polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer poly amino acids either homopolymers or random copolymers poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol homopolymers PPG and other polyakylene oxides polypropylene oxide ethylene oxide copolymers polyoxyethylated polyols POG e.g. glycerol and other polyoxyethylated polyols polyoxyethylated sorbitol or polyoxyethylated glucose colonic acids or other carbohydrate polymers Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof.

As used herein polyethylene glycol PEG is meant to encompass any of the forms that have been used to derivatize other proteins such as mono C1 C10 alkoxy or aryloxy polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water.

Specifically a modified heterologous polypeptide of the invention may be prepared by attaching polyaminoacids or branch point amino acids to the polypeptide. For example the polyaminoacid may be a carrier protein that serves to increase the circulation half life of the polypeptide in addition to the advantages achieved via a fusion molecule . For the therapeutic purpose of the present invention such polyaminoacids should ideally be those that have or do not create neutralizing antigenic response or other adverse responses. Such polyaminoacids may be chosen from serum album such as human serum albumin an additional antibody or portion thereof for example the Fc region fetuin A fetuin B leucine zipper nuclear factor erythroid derivative 2 NFE2 neuroretinal leucine zipper tetranectin or other polyaminoacids for example lysines. As described herein the location of attachment of the polyaminoacid may be at the N terminus or C terminus or other places in between and also may be connected by a chemical linker moiety to the selected molecule.

Polymers used herein for example water soluble polymers may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The polymers each typically have an average molecular weight of between about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of a polymer some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight . The average molecular weight of each polymer may be between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa or between about 12 kDa and about 25 kDa. Generally the higher the molecular weight or the more branches the higher the polymer protein ratio. Other sizes may also be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile for example the duration of sustained release the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of a polymer on a modified molecule of the invention.

Polymers employed in the present invention are typically attached to a heterologous polypeptide with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the polypeptide. In general chemical derivatization may be performed under any suitable condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Activating groups which can be used to link the polymer to the active moieties include sulfone maleimide sulfhydryl thiol triflate tresylate azidirine oxirane and 5 pyridyl.

Polymers of the invention are typically attached to a heterologous polypeptide at the alpha or epsilon amino groups of amino acids or a reactive thiol group but it is also contemplated that a polymer group could be attached to any reactive group of the protein that is sufficiently reactive to become attached to a polymer group under suitable reaction conditions. Thus a polymer may be covalently bound to a heterologous polypeptide via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residue. Those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Those having a reactive thiol group include cysteine residues.

Methods for preparing fusion molecules conjugated with polymers such as water soluble polymers will each generally involve a reacting a heterologous polypeptide with a polymer under conditions whereby the polypeptide becomes attached to one or more polymers and b obtaining the reaction product. Reaction conditions for each conjugation may be selected from any of those known in the art or those subsequently developed but should be selected to avoid or limit exposure to reaction conditions such as temperatures solvents and pH levels that would inactivate the protein to be modified. In general the optimal reaction conditions for the reactions will be determined case by case based on known parameters and the desired result. For example the larger the ratio of polymer polypeptide conjugate the greater the percentage of conjugated product. The optimum ratio in terms of efficiency of reaction in that there is no excess unreacted polypeptide or polymer may be determined by factors such as the desired degree of derivatization e.g. mono di tri etc. the molecular weight of the polymer selected whether the polymer is branched or unbranched and the reaction conditions used. The ratio of polymer for example PEG to a polypeptide will generally range from 1 1 to 100 1. One or more purified conjugates may be prepared from each mixture by standard purification techniques including among others dialysis salting out ultrafiltration ion exchange chromatography gel filtration chromatography and electrophoresis.

One may specifically desire an N terminal chemically modified protein. One may select a polymer by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polymers to protein polypeptide or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminal chemically modified protein. The method of obtaining the N terminal chemically modified protein preparation separating this moiety from other monoderivatized moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminal chemically modified protein material from a population of chemically modified protein molecules.

Selective N terminal chemical modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved. For example one may selectively attach a polymer to the N terminus of the protein by performing the reaction at a pH which allows one to take advantage of the pKa differences between the amino group of the lysine residues and that of the amino group of the N terminal residue of the protein. By such selective derivatization attachment of a polymer to a protein is controlled the conjugation with the polymer takes place predominantly at the N terminus of the protein and no significant modification of other reactive groups such as the lysine side chain amino groups occurs. Using reductive alkylation the polymer may be of the type described above and should have a single reactive aldehyde for coupling to the protein. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde containing a single reactive aldehyde may also be used.

In one embodiment the present invention contemplates the chemically derivatized polypeptide to include mono or poly e.g. 2 4 PEG moieties. Pegylation may be carried out by any of the pegylation reactions known in the art. Methods for preparing a pegylated protein product will generally include a reacting a polypeptide with polyethylene glycol such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG under conditions whereby the protein becomes attached to one or more PEG groups and b obtaining the reaction product s . In general the optimal reaction conditions for the reactions will be determined case by case based on known parameters and the desired result.

There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art. See for example EP 0 401 384 Malik et al. 20 1028 1035 1992 Francis 3 2 4 10 1992 EP 0 154 316 EP 0 401 384 WO 92 16221 WO 95 34326 and the other publications cited herein that relate to pegylation.

The step of pegylation as described herein may be carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule. Thus protein products according to the present invention include pegylated proteins wherein the PEG group s is are attached via acyl or alkyl groups. Such products may be mono pegylated or poly pegylated for example those containing 2 6 or 2 5 PEG groups . The PEG groups are generally attached to the protein at the or amino groups of amino acids but it is also contemplated that the PEG groups could be attached to any amino group attached to the protein that is sufficiently reactive to become attached to a PEG group under suitable reaction conditions.

Pegylation by acylation generally involves reacting an active ester derivative of polyethylene glycol PEG with a polypeptide of the invention. For acylation reactions the polymer s selected typically have a single reactive ester group. Any known or subsequently discovered reactive PEG molecule may be used to carry out the pegylation reaction. An example of a suitable activated PEG ester is PEG esterified to N hydroxysuccinimide NHS . As used herein acylation is contemplated to include without limitation the following types of linkages between the therapeutic protein and a polymer such as PEG amide carbamate urethane and the like see for example Chamow 5 133 140 1994 . Reaction conditions may be selected from any of those known in the pegylation art or those subsequently developed but should avoid conditions such as temperature solvent and pH that would inactivate the polypeptide to be modified.

Pegylation by acylation will generally result in a poly pegylated protein. The connecting linkage may be an amide. The resulting product may be substantially only e.g. 95 mono di or tri pegylated. However some species with higher degrees of pegylation may be formed in amounts depending on the specific reaction conditions used. If desired more purified pegylated species may be separated from the mixture particularly unreacted species by standard purification techniques including among others dialysis salting out ultrafiltration ion exchange chromatography gel filtration chromatography and electrophoresis.

Pegylation by alkylation generally involves reacting a terminal aldehyde derivative of PEG with a polypeptide in the presence of a reducing agent. For the reductive alkylation reaction the polymer s selected should have a single reactive aldehyde group. An exemplary reactive PEG aldehyde is polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde which is water stable or mono C1 C10 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 252 714.

Additionally heterologous polypeptides of the present invention and the epitope bearing fragments thereof described herein can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgG resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These particular fusion molecules facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. This has been shown for example in chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins such as EP 0 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . Fusion molecules that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than for example a monomeric polypeptide or polypeptide fragment alone see for example Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 .

In another described embodiment a human serum albumin fusion molecule may also be prepared as described herein and as further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 686 179.

Moreover the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. The marker amino acid sequence may be a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector Qiagen Mississauga Ontario Canada among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification the hemagglutinin HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 . Any of these above fusions can be engineered using the polynucleotides or the polypeptides of the present invention.

As demonstrated herein and in U.S. 60 647 013 in order for some secreted proteins to express and secrete in larger quantities a secretory leader sequence from another different secreted protein is desirable. Employing heterologous secretory leader sequences is advantageous in that a resulting mature amino acid sequence of the secreted polypeptide is not altered as the secretory leader sequence is removed in the ER during the secretion process. Moreover the addition of a heterologous secretory leader is required to express and secrete some proteins.

Thus to identify potential robust secretory leader sequence s that could universally be used to secrete proteins and to express MGD CSF Applicants have cloned and expressed a number of different secreted proteins and measured their expression and secretion levels in the supernatant of cells of the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 which are transformed by adenovirus 5 Graham et al. 36 59 1977 . Several high expressers and high level secretory proteins were observed.

In one embodiment secretory leader sequences belonging to the secreted protein collagen type IX alpha I chain long form was selected to further examine its ability to promote expression and secretion when used as a heterologous secretory leader sequence. As described herein the amino acid sequence of the secreted protein collagen type IX alpha I chain long form is predicted to be MKTCWKIPVFFFVCSFLEPWASA SEQ ID NO. 14 . As further described herein vectors were constructed containing this particular secretory leader several proteins were cloned removing the secretory leader from the full length encoding sequence and by cloning them into vectors containing SEQ ID NO. 14 resulting in secreted proteins with a heterologous secretory leader sequence. High expression and secretion of several other selected proteins were also observed.

Identified secretory leader sequences described herein include for example interleukin 9 precursor T cell growth factor P40 P40 cytokine triacylglycerol lipase pancreatic precursor somatoliberin precursor vasopressin neurophysin 2 copeptin precursor beta enoendorphin dynorphin precursor complement C2 precursor small inducible cytokine A14 precursor elastase 2A precursor plasma serine protease inhibitor precursor granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor precursor interleukin 2 precursor interleukin 3 precursor alpha fetoprotein precursor alpha 2 HS glycoprotein precursor serum albumin precursor inter alpha trypsin inhibitor light chain serum amyloid P component precursor apolipoprotein A II precursor apolipoprotein D precursor colipase precursor carboxypeptidase A1 precursor alpha s1 casein precursor beta casein precursor cystatin SA precursor follitropin beta chain precursor glucagon precursor complement factor H precursor histidine rich glycoprotein precursor interleukin 5 precursor alpha lactalbumin precursor Von Ebner s gland protein precursor matrix Gla protein precursor alpha 1 acid glycoprotein 2 precursor phospholipase A2 precursor dendritic cell chemokine 1 statherin precursor transthyretin precursor apolipoprotein A 1 precursor apolipoprotein C III precursor apolipoprotein E precursor complement component C8 gamma chain precursor serotransferrin precursor beta 2 microglobulin precursor neutrophils defensins 1 precursor triacylglycerol lipase gastric precursor haptoglobin precursor neutrophils defensins 3 precursor neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 precursor small inducible cytokine A13 precursor CD5 antigen like precursor phospholipids transfer protein precursor dickkopf related protein 4 precursor elastase 2B precursor alpha 1 acid glycoprotein 1 precursor beta 2 glycoprotein 1 precursor neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin precursor C reactive protein precursor interferon gamma precursor kappa casein precursor plasma retinol binding protein precursor interleukin 13 precursor and any of the secreted proteins set forth in the Tables or Sequence Listing.

The secretory leader sequences vectors and methods described herein are useful in the expression of a wide variety of polypeptides including for example secreted polypeptides extracellular proteins transmembrane proteins and receptors such as soluble receptors. Examples of such polypeptides include but are not limited to cytokines and growth factors such as interleukins 1 18 interferons lymphokines hormones Regulated on Activation Normal T Expressed and Secreted RANTES lymphotoxin Fas ligand flt 3 ligand ligand for receptor activator of NF kappa B RANKL soluble receptors TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL CD40 ligand Ox40 ligand 4 1BB ligand and other members of the TNF family thymic stroma derived lymphopoietin stimulatory factors for example granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF inhibitory factors mast cell growth factor stem cell growth factor epidermal growth factor growth hormone tumor necrosis factor TNF leukemia inhibitory factor LIF oncostatin M hematopoietic factors such as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and splice variants of any of these.

Descriptions of some proteins that can be expressed according to the invention may be found in for example Aggarwal and Gutterman eds. Blackwell Sciences Cambridge Mass. 1998 McKay and Leigh eds. Oxford University Press Inc. New York 1993 and A. W. Thompson ed. Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1991 .

Receptors for any of the aforementioned proteins may also be expressed using secretory leader sequences vectors and methods described herein including for example both forms of tumor necrosis factor receptor referred to as p55 and p 75 interleukin 1 receptors type 1 and 2 interleukin 4 receptor interleukin 15 receptor interleukin 17 receptor interleukin 18 receptor granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor receptors for oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor activator of NF kappa B RANK receptors for TRAIL and receptors that comprise death domains such as Fas or apoptosis inducing receptor AIR .

Other proteins that can be expressed using the secretory leader sequences vectors and methods described herein include for example cluster of differentiation antigens referred to as CD proteins for example those disclosed in Kishimoto Kikutani et al. eds. Kobe Japan 1996 or CD molecules disclosed in subsequent workshops. Examples of such molecules include CD27 CD30 CD39 CD40 and ligands thereto CD27 ligand CD30 ligand and CD40 ligand . Several of these are members of the TNF receptor family which also includes 41BB and OX40 the ligands are often members of the TNF family as are 4 1BB ligand and OX40 ligand accordingly members of the TNF and TNFR families can also be expressed using the present invention.

Proteins that are enzymatically active may also be expressed employing the herein described secretory leader sequences vectors and methods and include for example metalloproteinase disintegrin family members various kinases including streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator as well as death associated kinase containing ankyrin repeats and IKR 1 and 2 TNF alpha converting enzyme and numerous other enzymes. Ligands for enzymatically active proteins can also be expressed by applying the instant invention.

The secretory leader sequences vectors and methods described herein are also useful for the expression of other types of recombinant proteins including for example immunoglobulin molecules or portions thereof and chimeric antibodies antibodies having a human constant region couples to a murine antigen binding region or fragments thereof. Numerous techniques are known by which DNA encoding immunoglobulin molecules can be manipulated to yield DNAs capable of encoding recombinant proteins such as single chain antibodies antibodies with enhanced affinity or other antibody based polypeptides see for example Larrick et al. 7 934 938 1989 Reichmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Roberts et al. 328 731 734 1987 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 and Chaudhary et al. 339 394 397 1989 .

The invention encompasses polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation for example by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage or linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NABH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction and or metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin.

Additional post translational modifications encompassed by the invention include for example for example N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivitization may be chosen from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

A polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol a suitable molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog .

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art such as EP 0 401 384 coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Suitable for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein polypeptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

In certain embodiments relating to chromosomal mapping a cDNA herein disclosed is used to clone the genomic nucleic acid of MGD CSF. This can be accomplished using a variety of well known techniques and libraries which generally are commercially available. The genomic DNA then is used for in situ chromosome mapping using techniques well known for this purpose. Therefore the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are also valuable for chromosome identification. The sequence is specifically targeted to and can hybridize with a particular location on an individual human chromosome. Moreover there is a current need for identifying particular sites on the chromosome. Few chromosome marking reagents based on actual sequence data repeat polymorphisms are presently available for marking chromosomal location. The mapping of DNAs to chromosomes according to the present invention is an important first step in correlating those sequences with genes associated with disease.

Briefly sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the 3 untranslated region is used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA thus complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the primer will yield an amplified fragment.

PCR mapping of somatic cell hybrids is a rapid procedure for assigning a particular DNA to a particular chromosome. Using the present invention with the same oligonucleotide primers sublocalization can be achieved with panels of fragments from specific chromosomes or pools of large genomic clones in an analogous manner. Other mapping strategies that can similarly be used to map to its chromosome include in situ hybridization prescreening with labeled flow sorted chromosomes and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific cDNA libraries.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH of a cDNA clone to a metaphase Chromosomal spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be used with a cDNA as short as approximately 50 60 bases. For a review of this technique see Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 .

Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found for example in V. McKusick available on line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library . The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis coinheritance of physically adjacent genes .

Next differences can be determined in the cDNA or genomic sequences of affected and unaffected individuals. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any normal individuals then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the disease. With current resolution of physical mapping and genetic mapping techniques a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of between 50 and 500 potential causative genes assuming 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb .

The gene encoding MGD CSF is located at chromosome 16q22.1. Linkage analysis studies suggest that a gene on 16q22 is involved in the causation of familial myelogenous leukemia Horwitz et al. 61 873 881 1997 . In this study of a family with 11 relevant meioses transmitting autosomal dominant acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia linkages to the well known leukemia translocation breakpoint regions 21q22.1 q22.2 and 9p22 p21 were excluded. Horwitz et al. linked these diseases using the microsatellite marker D16S522 with a maximum 2 point lod score of 2.82 at recombination fraction theta 0.0 thus providing evidence for linkage to 16q22. Haplotype analysis showed a 23.5 cM region of 16q22 that was inherited in common by all affected family members and extended from D16S451 to D16S289. Nonparametric linkage analysis gave a P value of 0.00098 for the conditional probability of linkage. Mutational analysis excluded expansion of the AT rich minisatellite repeat FRA16B fragile site and the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the E2F 4 transcription factor which is present in many growth responsive and growth promoting genes. The repeat expansion detection method capable of detecting dynamic mutation associated with anticipation more generally excluded large CAG repeat expansion as a cause of leukemia in this family. MGD CSF is located at chromosome 16q22.1. Thus it may potentially play a role in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia and may be used to treat these diseases.

In general they are administered in an amount of at least about 10 micrograms kg body weight and in most cases they will be administered in an amount not in excess of about 8 milligrams kg body weight per day.

The polypeptides of the invention and agonist and antagonist compounds which are polypeptides may also be employed in accordance with the present invention by expression of such polypeptides in vivo i.e. gene therapy. Thus for example cells may be engineered with a polynucleotide DNA or RNA encoding for the polypeptide ex vivo the engineered cells are then provided to a patient. Such methods are well known in the art. For example cells may be engineered by procedures known in the art by use of a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding for the polypeptide of the present invention.

Similarly cells may be engineered in vivo for expressing the polypeptide in vivo for example by procedures known in the art. As known in the art a cell producing a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention may be administered to a patient for the purpose of engineering cells in vivo and expressing the polypeptide in vivo. These and other methods for administering a polypeptide of the present invention by similar methods should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention.

In one alternative the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome or coupled to a lipid and then administered to a host.

The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include the nucleic acid sequence s encoding the polypeptides. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed to transduce eukaryotic cells either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express the nucleic acid sequence s encoding the polypeptide. Eukaryotic cells which may be transduced include but are not limited to embryonic stem cells embryonic carcinoma cells as well as hematopoietic stem cells hepatocytes fibroblasts myoblasts keratinocytes endothelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells.

In some embodiments MGD CSF compositions are provided in formulation with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients a wide variety of which are known in the art Gennaro 20th ed. 2003 Ansel et al. 7ed. Lippencott Williams and Wilkins 2004 Kibbe et al. 3ed. Pharmaceutical Press 2000 . Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as vehicles adjuvants carriers or diluents are available to the public. Moreover pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances such as pH adjusting and buffering agents tonicity adjusting agents stabilizers wetting agents and the like are available to the public.

In pharmaceutical dosage forms the compositions of the invention can be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or they can also be used alone or in appropriate association as well as in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The subject compositions are formulated in accordance to the mode of potential administration. Administration of the agents can be achieved in various ways including oral buccal nasal rectal parenteral intraperitoneal intradermal transdermal subcutaneous intravenous intra arterial intracardiac intraventricular intracranial intratracheal and intrathecal administration etc. or otherwise by implantation or inhalation. Thus the subject compositions can be formulated into preparations in solid semi solid liquid or gaseous forms such as tablets capsules powders granules ointments solutions suppositories enemas injections inhalants and aerosols. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.

Compositions for oral administration can form solutions suspensions tablets pills granules capsules sustained release formulations oral rinses or powders. For oral preparations the agents polynucleotides and polypeptides can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives for example with conventional additives such as lactose mannitol corn starch or potato starch with binders such as crystalline cellulose cellulose derivatives acacia corn starch or gelatins with disintegrators such as corn starch potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and if desired with diluents buffering agents moistening agents preservatives and flavoring agents.

Suitable excipient vehicles are for example water saline dextrose glycerol ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition if desired the vehicle can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in the art Gennaro supra . The composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of the agent adequate to achieve the desired state in the subject being treated.

The agents polynucleotides and polypeptides can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent such as vegetable or other similar oils synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol and if desired with conventional additives such as solubilizers isotonic agents suspending agents emulsifying agents stabilizers and preservatives. Other formulations for oral or parenteral delivery can also be used as conventional in the art.

The antibodies agents polynucleotides and polypeptides can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane propane nitrogen and the like. Further the agent polynucleotides or polypeptide composition may be converted to powder form for administration intranasally or by inhalation as conventional in the art.

Furthermore the agents can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water soluble bases. The compounds of the present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols which melt at body temperature yet are solidified at room temperature.

A polynucleotide polypeptide or other modulator can also be introduced into tissues or host cells by other routes such as viral infection microinjection or vesicle fusion. For example expression vectors can be used to introduce nucleic acid compositions into a cell as described above. Further jet injection can be used for intramuscular administration Furth et al. 205 365 368 1992 . The DNA can be coated onto gold microparticles and delivered intradermally by a particle bombardment device or gene gun as described in the literature Tang et al. 356 152 154 1992 where gold microprojectiles are coated with the DNA then bombarded into skin cells.

Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups elixirs and suspensions can be provided wherein each dosage unit for example teaspoonful tablespoonful tablet or suppository contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more agents. Similarly unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration can comprise the agent s in a composition as a solution in sterile water normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The invention provides modulators including polypeptides polynucleotides and other agents that increase or decrease the activity of their target. Modulators of the invention may act as an agonist or antagonist and may interfere with the binding or activity of polypeptides or polynucleotides. Such modulators or agents include for example polypeptide variants whether agonist or antagonist antibodies whether agonist or antagonist soluble receptors usually antagonists small molecule drugs whether agonist or antagonist RNAi usually an antagonist antisense molecules usually an antagonist and ribozymes usually an antagonist. In some embodiments an agent is a subject polypeptide where the subject polypeptide itself is administered to an individual. In some embodiments an agent is an antibody specific for a subject target polypeptide. In some embodiments an agent is a chemical compound such as a small molecule that may be useful as an orally available drug. Such modulation includes the recruitment of other molecules that directly effect the modulation. For example an antibody that modulates the activity of a subject polypeptide that is a receptor on a cell surface may bind to the receptor and fix complement activating the complement cascade and resulting in lysis of the cell. An agent which modulates a biological activity of a subject polypeptide or polynucleotide increases or decreases the activity or binding at least about 10 at least about 15 at least about 20 at least about 25 at least about 50 at least about 80 or at least about 2 fold at least about 5 fold or at least about 10 fold or more when compared to a suitable control.

The invention also provides a method of screening compounds to identify those which modulate the biological activity of a polypeptide of the present invention. Examples of the biological activities of the polypeptides of the invention are described in greater detail herein for example in the Examples and the Figures.

The invention further provides a method wherein a mammalian cell or membrane preparation expressing a receptor for a polypeptide of the present invention as described above is incubated with a labeled polypeptide of the present invention in the presence of the compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction is then measured. Alternatively the response of a known second messenger system following interaction of a compound to be screened and a MGD CSF receptor is measured and the ability of the compound to bind to the receptor and elicit a second messenger response is measured to determine if the compound is a potential agonist or antagonist. Such second messenger systems include but are not limited to those mediated by cAMP guanylate cyclase ion channels and phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

Examples of antagonistic compounds include antibodies or in some cases oligonucleotides which bind to a receptor of a polypeptide of the present invention but elicit no second messenger response or which bind to the MGD CSF polypeptide itself. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a mutant form of the polypeptide which binds to the receptors but elicits no second messenger response thus effectively blocking the action of the polypeptide.

Another compound antagonistic to MGD CSF genes and gene products is an antisense construct prepared using antisense technology. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both methods are based on the binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example a 5 coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence which encodes mature polypeptides of the present invention can be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to about 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription for example a triple helix see Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 thereby preventing transcription and the production of the polypeptides of the present invention. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the polypeptide as described by Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA is expressed in vivo to inhibit polypeptide production.

Potential antagonist compounds also include small molecules which bind to and occupy the binding site of the receptors thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its polypeptide such that normal biological activity is prevented. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules. Antagonist compounds may be employed to inhibit the effects of the polypeptides of the invention described in further detail in the Examples and Figures. The antagonists may be employed to diagnose determine a prognosis for prevent and treat immune related diseases as described in further detail below.

The present invention also provides methods for identifying agents such as antibodies which enhance or block the actions of MGD CSF molecules on cells. For example these agents may enhance or block interaction of MGD CSF binding molecules such as receptors. Agents of interest include both agonists and antagonists. The invention provides agonists which increase the natural biological functions of MGD CSF or which function in a manner similar to MGD CSF. The invention also provides antagonists which decrease or eliminate the functions of MGD CSF.

One method of identifying MGD CSF agonists and antagonists involves biochemical assays following subcellular fractionation. For example a cellular compartment such as a membrane or cytosolic preparation may be prepared from a cell that expresses a molecule that binds MGD CSF molecules such as a molecule of a signaling or regulatory pathway modulated by MGD CSF molecules. Subcellular fractionation methods are known in the art of cell biology and can be tailored to produce crude fractions with discrete and defined components for example organelles or organellar membranes. The preparation is incubated with labeled MGD CSF molecules in the absence or the presence of a candidate molecule which may be an MGD CSF agonist or antagonist. The ability of the candidate molecule to interact with the binding molecule or an MGD CSF molecules is reflected in decreased binding of the labeled ligand. Molecules which bind gratuitously that is without inducing the effects of MGD CSF molecules are most likely antagonists. Molecules that bind well and elicit effects that are the same as or closely related to MGD CSF molecules may potentially prove to be agonists.

The effects of potential agonists and antagonists may by measured for instance by determining an activity of one or more components of a second messenger system following interaction of the candidate molecule with a cell or appropriate cell preparation and comparing the effect with that of MGD CSF molecules or with that of molecules that elicit the same effects as MGD CSF. Second messenger systems which may be useful in this regard include but are not limited to cAMP cGMP ion channels and phosphoinositide hydrolysis second messenger systems.

Another example of an assay for the identification of MGD CSF antagonists is a competitive assay that combines a mixture of MGD CSF molecules and a potential antagonist with membrane bound MGD CSF receptor molecules. Under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay this assay can also be performed with recombinant MGD CSF receptor molecules. MGD CSF molecules can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of MGD CSF molecules bound to a receptor molecule can be determined accurately to assess the effectiveness of the potential antagonist.

Potential antagonists include small organic molecules polypeptides and antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention and thereby inhibit or extinguish its activity. Potential antagonists also may be small organic molecules polypeptides such as closely related proteins or antibodies that bind the same sites on a binding molecule such as a receptor molecule without inducing MGD CSF induced activities thereby preventing the action of MGD CSF molecules by excluding MGD CSF molecules from binding. Antagonists of the invention include fragments of the MGD CSF molecules having the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences shown in the Sequence Listing.

Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through for example antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 . The methods are based on the binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to about 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the subsequent production of MGD CSF molecules. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into a MGD CSF polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of MGD CSF molecules.

This invention is also related to the use of the genes and gene products of the present invention as part of a diagnostic assay for detecting diseases or susceptibility to diseases related to the presence of mutations in the nucleic acid sequences encoding the polypeptide of the present invention. Individuals carrying mutations in a gene of the present invention may be detected at the DNA level by a variety of techniques. Nucleic acids for diagnosis may be obtained from a patient s cells such as for example from blood urine saliva tissue biopsy and autopsy material. The genomic DNA may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR for example as described by Saiki et al. 324 163 166 1986 prior to analysis. RNA or cDNA may also be used for the same purpose. As an example PCR primers complementary to the nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be used to identify and analyze mutations. For example deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to the normal genotype. Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to radiolabeled RNA or alternatively radiolabeled antisense DNA sequences. Perfectly matched sequences can be distinguished from mismatched duplexes by RNase A digestion or by differences in melting temperatures.

Genetic testing based on DNA sequence differences may be achieved by detecting alterations in electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments in gels run with or without denaturing agents. Small sequence deletions and insertions can be visualized by high resolution gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments of different sequences may be distinguished on denaturing formamide gradient gels in which the mobilities of different DNA fragments are retarded in the gel at different positions according to their specific melting or partial melting temperatures for example as described by Myers et al. 230 1242 1985 .

Sequence changes at specific locations may also be revealed by nuclease protection assays such as RNase and S1 protection or the chemical cleavage method as shown in Cotton et al. 85 4397 4401 1985 . Thus the detection of a specific DNA sequence may be achieved by methods such as hybridization RNase protection chemical cleavage direct DNA sequencing or the use of restriction enzymes for example Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms RFLP and Southern blotting of genomic DNA. In addition to more conventional gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing mutations can also be detected by in situ analysis.

The present invention also relates to a diagnostic assay for detecting altered levels of MGD CSF proteins in various tissues. An over expression of these proteins compared to normal control tissue samples may detect the presence of abnormal cellular proliferation for example a tumor. Assays used to detect protein levels in a host derived sample are well known to those of skill in the art and include radioimmunoassays competitive binding assays Western Blot analysis ELISA assays sandwich assays and other assays for the expression levels of the genes encoding the MGD CSF proteins known in the art. Expression can be assayed by qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of MGD CSF protein or the level of mRNA encoding MGD CSF protein in a biological sample. Assays may be performed directly for example by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level or relatively by comparing the MGD CSF protein or mRNA to a second biological sample. In performing these assays the MGD CSF protein or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard MGD CSF protein level or mRNA level suitable standards include second biological samples obtained from an individual not having the disorder of interest. Standards may be obtained by averaging levels of MGD CSF in a population of individuals not having a disorder related to MGD CSF expression. As will be appreciated in the art once a standard MGD CSF protein level or mRNA level is known it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.

An ELISA assay for example as described by Coligan et al. 1 2 Chap. 6 1991 utilizes an antibody prepared with specificity to a polypeptide antigen of the present invention. In addition a reporter antibody is prepared against the monoclonal antibody. To the reporter antibody is attached a detectable reagent such as a radioactive tag a fluorescent tag or an enzymatic tag e.g. a horseradish peroxidase. A sample is removed from a host and incubated on a solid support e.g. a polystyrene dish that binds the proteins in the sample. Any free protein binding sites on the dish are then covered by incubating with a non specific protein e.g. bovine serum albumin. Next the specific antibody e.g. a monoclonal antibody is incubated in the dish during which time the antibody attaches to any polypeptides of the present invention attached to the polystyrene dish. All unbound monoclonal antibody is washed out with buffer. The reporter antibody for example one linked to horseradish peroxidase is placed in the dish resulting in the binding of the reporter antibody to any antibody bound to the protein of interest unattached reporter antibody is then removed. Substrate e.g. peroxidase is then added to the dish and the amount of signal produced color e.g. developed in a given time period provides a measurement of the amount of a polypeptide of the present invention present in a given volume of patient sample when compared against a standard.

A competition assay may be employed wherein antibodies specific to a polypeptide of the present invention are attached to a solid support and labeled MGD CSF along with a sample derived from the host are passed over the solid support. The label can be detected and quantified for example by liquid scintillation chromatography and the measurement can be correlated to the quantity of the polypeptide of interest present in the sample. A sandwich assay similar to an ELISA assay may be employed wherein a polypeptide of the present invention is passed over a solid support and binds to antibody modules attached to the solid support. A second antibody is then bound to the polypeptide of interest. A third antibody which is labeled and specific to the second antibody is then passed over the solid support and binds to the second antibody. The amount of antibody binding can be quantified it correlates with the amount of the polypeptide of interest. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 376 110.

Biological samples of the invention can include any biological sample obtained from a subject body fluid cell line tissue culture or other source which contains MGD CSF protein or mRNA. As indicated biological samples include body fluids such as sera plasma urine synovial fluid and spinal fluid which contain free MGD CSF protein ovarian or renal system tissue and other tissue sources found to express complete or mature MGD CSF polypeptide or an MGD CSF receptor. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA a tissue biopsy may provide the source.

Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single step guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi 162 156 159 1987 . Levels of mRNA encoding the MGD CSF protein are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis S1 nuclease mapping the polymerase chain reaction PCR reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction RT PCR and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction RT LCR .

Assaying MGD CSF protein levels in a biological sample can be performed using antibody based techniques. For example MGD CSF protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods for example Jalkanen M. et al. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen M. et al. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting MGD CSF protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase radioisotopes and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

In addition to assaying MGD CSF protein levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual MGD CSF protein can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of MGD CSF protein include those detectable by X radiography NMR or ESR. For X radiography suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to a subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin such as deuterium which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.

A MGD CSF protein specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety such as a radioisotope a radio opaque substance or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance is introduced for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into the subject to be examined for an immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then accumulate at the location of cells which contain MGD CSF protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in Burchiel et al. ed. Chapter 13 Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of MGD CSF polynucleotides polypeptides or antagonists to reduce MGD CSF or NP689669 mediated death of T cells in HIV infected patients. The role of T cell apoptosis in the development of AIDS has been the subject of a number of studies see for example Meyaard et al. 257 217 219 1992 Groux et al. 175 331 1992 and Oyaizu et al. in Andrieu and Lu eds. Plenum Press New York pp. 101 114 1995 .

It is likely that T cell apoptosis occurs through multiple mechanisms. Fas mediated apoptosis has been implicated in the loss of T cells in HIV individuals Katsikis et al. 181 2029 2036 1995 . Activated human T cells are induced to undergo programmed cell death apoptosis upon triggering through the CD3 T cell receptor complex a process termed activated induced cell death AICD . AICD of CD4 T cells isolated from HIV infected asymptomatic individuals has been reported Groux et al. supra . Thus AICD may play a role in the depletion of CD4 T cells and the progression to AIDS in HIV infected individuals. Accordingly the invention provides a method of inhibiting MGD CSF mediated T cell death in HIV patients comprising administering molecules of the invention to the patients. In an embodiment the patient is asymptomatic when treatment with MGD CSF polynucleotides polypeptides or antagonists commences. If desired prior to treatment peripheral blood T cells may be extracted from an HIV patient and tested for susceptibility to MGD CSF mediated cell death by procedures known in the art. In one embodiment a patient s blood or plasma is contacted with molecules of the invention for example anti MGD CSF or NP 689669 antibodies ex vivo. The antibodies or other antagonists may be bound to a suitable chromatography matrix by procedures known in the art. The patient s blood or plasma flows through a chromatography column containing the antagonist bound to the matrix before being returned to the patient. The immobilized antagonist binds MGD CSF or NP689699 thus removing it from the patient s blood.

In additional embodiments a molecule of the invention is administered in combination with other inhibitors of T cell apoptosis. For example as discussed above Fas mediated apoptosis also has been implicated in loss of T cells in HIV positive individuals Katsikis et al. 181 2029 2036 1995 . Thus a patient susceptible to both Fas ligand mediated and MGD CSF mediated T cell death may be treated with both an agent that blocks MGD CSF or NP689699 interactions with their receptors and an agent that blocks Fas ligand Fas interactions. Suitable agents for blocking binding of Fas ligand to Fas include but are not limited to soluble Fas polypeptides multimeric forms of soluble Fas polypeptides for example dimers of sFas Fc anti Fas antibodies that bind Fas without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis anti Fas ligand antibodies that block binding of Fas ligand to Fas and muteins of Fas ligand that bind Fas but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Monoclonal antibodies may be employed according to this method. Examples of suitable agents for blocking Fas ligand Fas interactions including blocking anti Fas monoclonal antibodies are described in WO 95 10540.

In another example agents which block binding of MGD CSF or NP689669 to a receptor are administered with the molecules of the invention. Such agents include but are not limited to soluble MGD CSF receptor polypeptides multimeric forms of soluble receptor polypeptides and MGD CSF receptor antibodies that bind the MGD CSF or NP689669 receptor without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis antibodies that block binding of MGD CSF or NP689669 to one or more receptors and muteins that bind to receptors but do not transduce a biological signal that results in apoptosis.

Molecules of the invention may also be employed to regulate hematopoeisis including erythropoiesis. Hematopoeisis is a multi step cell proliferation and differentiation process which begins with a pool of multipotent stem cells.

In an embodiment the molecules of the invention are used to treat or prevent bone diseases.

MGD CSF and related molecules may be used as therapeutics for example protein therapeutics or in gene therapy to treat these diseases.

In an embodiment the molecules of the invention are used to treat or prevent neural diseases. Molecules of the invention promote the differentiation of hematopoeitic stem cells into microglial precursor cells. Accordingly molecules of the invention can be used to treat neural diseases such as those characterized by defects in microglial differentiation and function for example Alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis acute disseminated encephalomyelopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy stroke and Parkinson s disease. MGD CSF and related molecules may be used as therapeutics for example protein therapeutics or in gene therapy to treat these diseases.

Antibodies specific to MGD CSF or NP689669 are suitable for use in the present invention and can be raised against the intact MGD CSF protein or an antigenic polypeptide fragment thereof. The protein or fragment may be presented with or without a carrier protein such as an albumin to an animal such as a rabbit or mouse . In general polypeptide fragments are sufficiently immunogenic to produce a satisfactory immune response without a carrier if they are at least about 25 amino acids in length.

Antibodies of the invention include polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies altered antibodies chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies as well as hybrid chimeric antibody molecules see for example Winter et al. 349 293 299 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 F ab and F ab fragments Fv molecules noncovalent heterodimers see for example Inbar et al. 69 2659 2662 1972 and Ehrlich et al. 1980 19 4091 4096 single chain Fv molecules sFv see e.g. Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1980 dimeric and trimeric antibody fragment constructs minibodies see e.g. Pack et al. 31 1579 1584 1992 Cumber et al. 149B 120 126 1992 humanized antibody molecules see e.g. Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyan et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 heteroconjugate and bispecific antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 010 902 and U.S. Patent Appln. 2002 0155604 and any functional fragments obtained from such molecules wherein such fragments retain specific binding.

Methods of making monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies are generally antibodies having a homogeneous antibody population. The term is not limited regarding the species or source of the antibody nor is it intended to be limited by the manner in which it is made. The term encompasses whole immunoglobulins. Polyclonal antibodies are generated by immunizing a suitable animal such as a mouse rat rabbit sheep or goat with an antigen of interest such as a stem cell transformed with a gene encoding an antigen. In order to enhance immunogenicity the antigen can be linked to a carrier prior to immunization. Suitable carriers are typically large slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins polysaccharides polylactic acids polyglycolic acids polymeric amino acids amino acid copolymers lipid aggregates such as oil droplets or liposomes and inactive virus particles. Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore the antigen may be conjugated to a bacterial toxoid such as a toxoid from diphtheria tetanus cholera etc. in order to enhance the immunogenicity thereof.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 81 851 855 1984 Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. 314 452 454 1985 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. Chimeric antibodies which are antibodies in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region for example humanized antibodies and insertion deletions relating to cdr and framework regions are suitable for use in the invention.

The invention also includes humanized antibodies i.e. those with mostly human immunoglobulin sequences. Humanized antibodies of the invention generally refer to non human immunoglobulins that have been modified to incorporate portions of human sequences. A humanized antibody may include a human antibody that contains entirely human immunoglobulin sequences.

The antibodies of the invention may be prepared by any of a variety of methods. For example cells expressing an MGD CSF or NP 689669 protein or an antigenic fragment thereof can be administered to an animal in order to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. A preparation of MGD CSF or NP689669 protein can be prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants and the preparation introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera with specific binding activity.

Antibodies of the invention specifically bind to their respective antigen s they may display high avidity and or high affinity to a specific polypeptide or more accurately to an epitope of an antigen. Antibodies of the invention may bind to one epitope or to more than one epitope. They may display different affinities and or avidities to different epitopes on one or more molecules. When an antibody binds more strongly to one epitope than to another adjusting the binding conditions can in some instances result in antibody binding almost exclusively to the specific epitope and not to any other epitopes on the same polypeptide and not to a polypeptide that does not comprise the epitope.

The invention also provides monoclonal antibodies and MGD CSF or NP689669 protein binding fragments thereof. Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be prepared using hybridoma technology for example Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 Kohler et al. 6 511 1976 Kohler et. al. 6 292 1976 Hammerling et al. in Elsevier N.Y. 1981 pp. 563 681. In general such procedures involve immunizing an animal for example a mouse with an MGD CSF protein antigen or with an MGD CSF protein expressing cell. Suitable cells can be recognized by their capacity to bind anti MGD CSF protein antibody. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium for example in Earle s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum inactivated at about 56 C. and supplemented with about 10 grams liter of nonessential amino acids about 1 000 U ml of penicillin and about 100 g ml of streptomycin. The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention e.g. the parent myeloma cell line SP20 available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. After fusion the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium and then cloned by limiting dilution for example as described by Wands et al. 80 225 232 1981 .

Alternatively antibodies capable of binding to the MGD CSF or NP689669 protein antigen may be produced in a two step procedure through the use of anti idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens and that therefore it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal such as a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the specific antibody can be blocked by the antigen. Such antibodies comprise anti idiotypic antibodies to the MGD CSF or NP689669 protein specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further specific antibodies.

It will be appreciated that Fab and F ab and other fragments of the antibodies of the present invention may be used according to the methods disclosed herein. Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab fragments . Alternatively MGD CSF protein binding fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry. Humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies are suitable for in vivo use of anti MGD CSF in humans. Such humanized antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See for review Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Taniguchi et al. EP 0 171 496 Morrison et al. EP 0 173 494 Neuberger et al. WO 8601533 Robinson et al. WO 8702671 Boulianne et al. 312 643 1984 Neuberger et al. 314 268 1985 .

The invention provides a method for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of a subject needing or desiring such treatment by providing a vaccine that can be administered to the subject. It also provides a method for enhancing immune response to a subject by providing a substantially purified polypeptide from SEQ. ID. NOS. 7 12 or an active fragment providing a vaccine composition and administering the polypeptide and vaccine compositions to the subject. The vaccine may comprise one or more of a polynucleotide polypeptide or modulator of the invention for example an antibody vaccine composition a polypeptide vaccine composition or a polynucleotide vaccine composition useful for treating cancer proliferative inflammatory immune metabolic bacterial or viral disorders.

For example the vaccine can be a cancer vaccine and the polypeptide can concomitantly be a cancer antigen. The vaccine may be an anti inflammatory vaccine and the polypeptide can concomitantly be an inflammation related antigen. The vaccine may be a viral vaccine and the polypeptide can concomitantly be a viral antigen. In some embodiments the vaccine comprises a polypeptide fragment comprising at least one extracellular fragment of a polypeptide of the invention and or at least one extracellular fragment of a polypeptide of the invention minus the signal peptide for the treatment for example of proliferative disorders such as cancer. In certain embodiments the vaccine comprises a polynucleotide encoding one or more such fragments administered for the treatment for example of proliferative disorders such as cancer. Further the vaccine can be administered with or without an adjuvant. The vaccine can be administered with polypeptides shown in the Tables and Sequence Listing it may be administered prior to substantially contemporaneously with or after administering the polypeptides.

Vaccine therapy involves the use of polynucleotides polypeptides or agents of the invention as immunogens for tumor antigens Machiels et al. 29 494 502 2002 . For example peptide based vaccines of the invention include unmodified subject polypeptides fragments thereof and MHC class I and class II restricted peptide Knutson et al. 07 477 484 2001 comprising for example the disclosed sequences with universal nonspecific MHC class II restricted epitopes. Peptide based vaccines comprising a tumor antigen can be given directly either alone or in conjunction with other molecules. The vaccines can also be delivered orally by producing the antigens in transgenic plants that can be subsequently ingested U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 964 .

In some embodiments antibodies themselves can be used as antigens in anti idiotype vaccines. That is administering an antibody to a tumor antigen stimulates B cells to make antibodies to that antibody which in turn recognize the tumor cells

Nucleic acid based vaccines can deliver tumor antigens as polynucleotide constructs encoding the antigen. Vaccines comprising genetic material such as DNA or RNA can be given directly either alone or in conjunction with other molecules. Administration of a vaccine expressing a molecule of the invention e.g. as plasmid DNA leads to persistent expression and release of the therapeutic immunogen over a period of time helping to control unwanted tumor growth.

In some embodiments nucleic acid based vaccines encode subject antibodies. In such embodiments the vaccines e.g. DNA vaccines can include post transcriptional regulatory elements such as the post transcriptional regulatory acting RNA element WPRE derived from Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus. These post transcriptional regulatory elements can be used to target the antibody or a fusion protein comprising the antibody and a co stimulatory molecule to the tumor microenvironment Pertl et al. 101 649 654 2003 .

Besides stimulating anti tumor immune responses by inducing humoral responses vaccines of the invention can also induce cellular responses including stimulating T cells that recognize and kill tumor cells directly. For example nucleotide based vaccines of the invention encoding tumor antigens can be used to activate the CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte arm of the immune system.

In some embodiments the vaccines activate T cells directly and in others they enlist antigen presenting cells to activate T cells. Killer T cells are primed in part by interacting with antigen presenting cells for example dendritic cells. In some embodiments plasmids comprising the nucleic acid molecules of the invention enter antigen presenting cells which in turn display the encoded tumor antigens that contribute to killer T cell activation. Again the tumor antigens can be delivered as plasmid DNA constructs either alone or with other molecules.

Since MGD CSF and NP689669 can promote dendritic cell differentiation in vitro from either human bone marrow CD34 stem cells or peripheral blood monocytes molecules of the invention can be used to expand dendritic cells ex vivo. The expanded cell population can then be returned to the patient for example as a dendritic cell vaccine. Furthermore molecules of the invention may promote dendritic cell differentiation from autologous hematopoietic stem cells and or monocytes in vivo in the patient which will enhance the patient s antigen presenting capability and contribute to the ability to combat certain diseases such as cancer.

In further embodiments RNA can be used in vaccine production. For example dendritic cells can be transfected with RNA encoding tumor antigens Heiser et al. J. Clin. Invest. 109 409 417 2002 Mitchell and Nair 106 1065 1069 2000 . This approach overcomes the limitations of obtaining sufficient quantities of tumor material extending therapy to patients otherwise excluded from clinical trials. For example a subject RNA molecule isolated from tumors can be amplified using RT PCR. In some embodiments the RNA molecule of the invention is directly isolated from tumors and transfected into dendritic cells with no intervening cloning steps.

In some embodiments the molecules of the invention are altered such that the peptide antigens are more highly antigenic than in their native state. These embodiments address the need in the art to overcome the poor in vivo immunogenicity of most tumor antigens by enhancing tumor antigen immunogenicity via modification of epitope sequences Yu and Restifo 110 289 294 2002 .

Another recognized problem of cancer vaccines is the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies. Some embodiments of the present invention overcome this problem by using viral vectors from non mammalian natural hosts for example avian pox viruses. Alternative embodiments that also circumvent preexisting neutralizing antibodies include genetically engineered influenza viruses and the use of naked plasmid DNA vaccines that contain DNA with no associated protein Yu and Restifo 110 289 294 2002 .

All of the immunogenic methods of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other conventional or unconventional therapies. For example immunogenic molecules can be combined with other molecules that have a variety of antiproliferative effects or with additional substances that help stimulate the immune response i.e. adjuvants or cytokines.

For example in some embodiments nucleic acid vaccines encode an alphaviral replicase enzyme in addition to tumor antigens. This approach to vaccine therapy successfully combines therapeutic antigen production with the induction of the apoptotic death of the tumor cell Yu and Restifo 110 289 294 2002 .

In some embodiments a molecule of the invention is involved in the control of cell proliferation and an agent of the invention inhibits undesirable cell proliferation. Such agents are useful for treating disorders that involve abnormal cell proliferation including but not limited to cancer psoriasis and scleroderma. Whether a particular agent and or therapeutic regimen of the invention is effective in reducing unwanted cellular proliferation e.g. in the context of treating cancer can be determined using standard methods. For example the number of cancer cells in a biological sample e.g. blood a biopsy sample and the like can be determined. The tumor mass can be determined using standard radiological or biochemical methods.

The molecules of the invention find use in immunotherapy of hyperproliferative disorders including cancer neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders. That is the subject molecules can correspond to tumor antigens of which over 1770 have been identified to date Yu and Restifo 110 289 294 2002 . Immunotherapeutic approaches include passive immunotherapy and vaccine therapy and can accomplish both generic and antigen specific cancer immunotherapy.

Passive immunity approaches involve antibodies of the invention that are directed toward specific tumor associated antigens. Such antibodies can eradicate systemic tumors at multiple sites without eradicating normal cells. In some embodiments the antibodies are combined with radioactive components as provided above for example combining the antibody s ability to specifically target tumors with the added lethality of the radioisotope to the tumor DNA.

Useful antibodies comprise a discrete epitope or a combination of nested epitopes i.e. a 10 mer epitope and associated peptide multimers incorporating all potential 8 mers and 9 mers or overlapping epitopes Dutoit et al. 110 1813 1822 2002 . Thus a single antibody can interact with one or more epitopes. Further the antibody can be used alone or in combination with different antibodies that all recognize either a single or multiple epitopes.

Neutralizing antibodies can provide therapy for cancer and proliferative disorders. Neutralizing antibodies that specifically recognize a protein or peptide of the invention can bind to the protein or peptide e.g. in a bodily fluid or the extracellular space thereby modulating the biological activity of the protein or peptide. For example neutralizing antibodies specific for proteins or peptides that play a role in stimulating the growth of cancer cells can be useful in modulating the growth of cancer cells. Similarly neutralizing antibodies specific for proteins or peptides that play a role in the differentiation of cancer cells can be useful in modulating the differentiation of cancer cells.

Endogenous gene expression can be reduced by inactivating or knocking out a gene of interest and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination for example Smithies et al. 317 230 234 1985 Thomas et al. 51 503 512 1987 and Thompson et al. 5 313 321 1989 . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene for example Thomas et al. 51 503 512 1987 Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention such as knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient including humans and non human animals or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells for example lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and or vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and secretion of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally. Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g. genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See for example Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

The polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic non human animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits hamsters guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats sheep cows and non human primates for example baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans as part of a gene therapy protocol.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene embodied in polynucleotides shown in the Sequence Listing into animals to produce a founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Paterson et al. 40 691 698 1994 Carver et al. 11 1263 1270 1993 Wright et al. 9 830 834 1991 and Hoppe et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 1989 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. 82 6148 6152 1985 blastocysts or embryos gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. Cell 56 313 321 1989 electroporation of cells or embryos Lo 3 1803 1814 1983 introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun see for example Ulmer et al. 259 1745 1993 introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pluripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon 115 171 229 1989 . See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 464 764 Capecchi et al. Positive Negative Selection Methods and Vectors U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 153 Capecchi et al. Cells and Non Human Organisms Containing Predetermined Genomic Modifications and Positive Negative Selection Methods and Vectors for Making Same U.S. Pat. No. 4 736 866 Leder et al. Transgenic Non Human Animals and U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 Wagner et al. Genetic Transformation of Zygotes . Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention for example nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic fetal or adult cells induced to quiescence Campbell et al. 380 64 66 1996 Wilmut et al. 385 810 813 1997 .

The invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgene in some but not all their cells such as mosaic or chimeric animals. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers for example head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al. 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. It may be desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene gene targeting is then suitable. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed using standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR RT PCR . Samples of transgenic gene expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.

Once the founder animals are produced they may be bred inbred outbred or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include but are not limited to outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.

Transgenic and knock out animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of molecules of the invention studying conditions and or disorders associated with aberrant expression of molecules of the invention and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and or disorders.

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises an antibody of the invention for example a purified antibody in one or more containers. In an embodiment the kits of the invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. The kits of the invention may also comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest.

In an embodiment the kits of the present invention comprise a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest. For example the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound an enzymatic substrate a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate .

In an embodiment the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against MGD CSF related molecules. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti polypeptide antigen antibody. Further such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of the antibody to the antigen. The antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry. In an embodiment the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.

In a further embodiment the detecting means of the above described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non attached reporter labeled anti human antibody. In this embodiment binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter labeled antibody.

In an additional embodiment the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In an embodiment the antibody is attached to a solid support. In an embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively or in addition the detecting means may include a labeled competing antigen.

In a diagnostic configuration test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing the reagent is reacted with reporter labeled anti human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric luminescent or colorimetric substrate.

The solid surface reagent may be prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material such as polymeric beads dip sticks 96 well plates and or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein typically through a free amine group to a chemically reactive group on the solid support such as an activated carboxyl hydroxyl or aldehyde group. Alternatively streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with a biotinylated antigen.

MGD CSF and NP689669 were compared by aligning their amino acids using the program clustal format for T COFFEE Version 1.37 cpu 0.00 sec. score 72 Nseq 3 len 242. As shown in the amino acid sequence of MGD CSF differs from the amino acid sequence of NP689669 MCG34647 . The latter sequence has a glutamine Q residue at amino acid 81. The five flanking amino acid residues adjacent to and on either side of amino acid 81 in the NCBI sequence of MCG34647 are NVTRLQRAQVS SEQ ID NO. 279 . In contrast to this published sequence of MCG34647 MGD CSF contains the amino acid sequence NVTRLRAQVS SEQ ID NO. 280 . The difference between these sequences results from alternative splicing of the MCG34647 gene between exons 3 and 4. The genome sequences at the exon 3 4 boundary are the codons aac gtc acc agg ctg gtg SEQ ID NO. 281 and cag cag agg gcc cag gtg agc SEQ ID NO. 282 wherein the gtg codon shown in italics represents the 5 splice donor site at the end of exon 3 and the two cag codons shown in italics represent two alternative splice acceptor sites at the beginning of exon 4. Thus the published MCG34647 sequence represents a transcript resulting from the use of the first cag splice acceptor site while the MGD CSF sequence represents a transcript resulting from the use of the second cag splice acceptor site.

The MCG34647 glutamine 81 residue is encoded by the second cag codon which is not spliced out when the first cag splice acceptor site is used. In contrast the use of the second cag as the splice acceptor site results in the first cag sequence being spliced out of the resulting RNA transcript which in turn results in the lack of a corresponding glutamine in the MGD CSF splice variant. Hence MGD CSF is a splice variant and represents RNA and protein species that are distinct from MCG34647.

The MGD CSF gene was cloned into pTT 5 and pTT 2 mammalian expression vectors modified as shown in and using standard cloning procedures. The MGD CSF gene was also cloned into the pIB V5His DEST insect cell expression vector Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. using standard cloning procedures.

To monitor the expression and secretion of MGD CSF and to aid in its purification the construct CLN00821867 was generated with a Tobacco Etch Virus TEV protease recognition site engineered between the protein and a C terminal cleavable tag. The seven amino acid recognition site for TEV protease is Glu Asn Leu Tyr Phe Gln Gly SEQ ID NO. 283 with cleavage occurring between Gln and Gly. Construct CLN00821867 was designated MGD CSF 1 to 241aa  TEV V5 Streptag II H8 and C tagged in vector pTT5 I.

To improve the secretion of MGD CSF its secretory signal peptide which is encoded by the first 20 amino acids was replaced by the 23 amino acids that encode the signal peptide of collagen GenBank protein accession number NP001842 . This construct CLN00848149 was designated MGD CSF collagen SP 1 23aa  MGD CSF 21 to 241aa and is untagged in vector pTT5 G. Another such construct also has a TEV protease recognition site engineered between the protein and the C terminal cleavable tag. CLN00816424 was designated MGD CSF collagen SP 1 23aa  MGD CSF 21 to 241aa  TEV V5 Streptag II H8 and is C tagged in vector pTT5 G.

CLN00816425 was designated MGD CSF collagenSP 1 23aa  H8 Streptag II V5 TEV MGD CSF 21 to 241aa and is N tagged in vector pTT5 H.

Deletion constructs were generated in which amino acids were deleted from the N terminal C terminal or both ends of mature proteins. The MGD CSF signal peptide of these deletion constructs was replaced with the collagen signal peptide. CLN00848160 has 25 N terminal amino acids deleted it was designated MGD CSF collagenSP 1 23aa  MGD CSF 26 to 241aa and is untagged in vector pTT5.

CLN00848220 has 25 N terminal amino acids and 10 C terminal amino acids deleted it was designated MGD CSF collagenSP 1 23aa  MGD CSF 26 to 231aa and is untagged in vector pTT5.

Two mouse orthologs of MGD CSF were identified and cloned by standard procedures into untagged pTT5 CLN00840257 and CLN00847948 and into pTT5 I tagged with a TEV site between the clone and the tag CLN00840253 and CLN00842712 . These orthologues can be used to perform animal studies relating to the biological activity of MGD CSF in mouse tissues and cells.

The mouse orthologs represented by constructs CLN00840257 and CLN00840235 were derived from adult male small intestine cDNA clone 2010004A03 from the RIKEN full length enriched library hypothetical protein 12842043 at locus AK008082. The construct CLN00840257 represents the open reading frame ORF of the nucleotide sequence of phantom clone 2010004A03 and is a mouse ortholog of human MGD CSF cloned into vector pTT5. The construct CLN00840253 represents the ORF of the nucleotide sequence of phantom clone 2010004A03 and was cloned into vector pTT5 I.

The mouse orthologs represented by constructs CLN00847948 and CLN00842712 were derived from cDNA clone 2010004A03 mRNA cDNA clone MGC 28891 IMAGE 4912097 complete cds 18921436 from the RIKEN full length enriched library at locus BC016254. The construct CLN00847948 18921436 represents the ORF nucleotide sequence of human MGD CSF cloned into vector pTT5. The construct CLN00842712 18921436 represents the ORF nucleotide sequence of human MGD CSF cloned into vector pTT5.

Complementary DNA encoding the MGD CSF polypeptide was cloned into the expression vectors pTT5 and pcDNA pDEST40 and expressed as both a tagged and untagged protein. Protein levels were quantified by measuring the levels of the tag for example a V5His tag by quantitative Western blot analysis. The expression vectors were transfected into adherent 293T cells using the transfection agent Fugene 6 Roche Nutley N.J. in DMEM with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and penicillin streptomycin 100 g ml 100 U ml and incubated at 37 C. in 5 COfor 40 hours after which the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for an additional 48 hours in complete DMEM. Cell supernatant was harvested cleared of cell debris by centrifugation and tested for biological activity untagged cDNA and protein expression V5 tagged cDNA by Western blot assay using an anti V5 antibody.

Expression studies were also performed with 293 6E cells transiently expressing tagged MGD CSF constructs in suspension culture. Cells were diluted to a density of 6 10cells ml in 25 ml FreeStyle medium Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. 18 24 hours before transfection. Transfection complexes were prepared by adding 25 g DNA to 1.25 ml PBS adding 50 l linear 25 kD polyethylenimine PEI Polysciences Warrington Pa. dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 mg ml mixing the solutions and incubating the mixture for 1 hour at room temperature before adding it to the cells to be transfected. Cells and their supernatants were harvested 3 6 days post transfection and protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis.

Cell suspensions 1 ml were pelleted then mixed with four parts XT sample buffer Bio Rad Hercules Calif. . Following denaturation at 99 C. for 3 minutes samples were either loaded onto a Criterion XT SDS PAGE gel Bio Rad Hercules Calif. or stored at 20 C. Cell pellets were lysed by resuspension in 100 l lysis buffer 1 NP 40 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 150 mM NaCl and one tablet complete protease inhibitors Roche Indianapolis Ind. . Lysed cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm and the proteins of the resulting cleared lysate as well as the cell supernatants were separated by SDS PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed by probing the membrane with a HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for the V5 epitope Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. or with a polyclonal rabbit anti MGD CSF antibody Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. South San Francisco Calif. . Bound rabbit anti MGD CSF antibody was detected with polyclonal goat anti rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase Jackson Immuno Research West Grove Pa. . Immunocomplexes were visualized by incubating the membrane in chemiluminescence substrate SuperSignal West Femto Pierce Rockford Ill. and exposing it to light sensitive film.

As shown in 293 6E cells expressed tagged MGD CSF between 3 and 6 days after transfection. shows the expression of MGD CSF tagged with V5H8 CLN00732663 transiently transfected into 293 6E cells. The left panel shows intracellular MGD CSF. Expression was most prominent at day 3 post transfection. The middle panel shows MGD CSF secreted into the supernatant. Expression was most prominent at day 6 post transfection. The right panel shows a quantitative positive control Positope Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. 

In both the protein loads of the cells and supernatants were matched so that the gel loads of the left and middle panels reflect comparable cell numbers. Thus the amount of MGD CSF shown in the middle panels reflects the cells secretory efficiency. Tagged protein detected in the supernatant had a molecular weight of approximately 40 kD whereas the intracellular protein had a molecular weight of approximately 37 kD presumably due to incomplete glycosylation. Yields of the secreted protein differed depending on the construct design. CLN00732663 was expressed intracellularly at a low yield. The 37 kD form and not the 40 kD form was detected in cell culture supernatant six days post transfection also at a low yield approximately 5 10 ng ml possibly due to cell lysis. Replacing the endogenous signal peptide with the exogenous secretion signal and an extended cleavable C terminal tag increased expression and secretion at least 10 fold CLN00816424 . In addition only the higher molecular weight protein band was detectable in the supernatant of cell cultures transfected with CLN00816424 indicating the protein was secreted and did not originate from lysed cells.

As shown in and Table 1 293 6E cells transiently transfected with CLN00816424 continued to proliferate from days 3 through 6 post transfection. The density of the cells in suspension culture was monitored by counting cells that excluded trypan blue using a hemocytometer from day 3 through day 6 following transfection with CLN00542945 black CLN00732663 light grey CLN00821867 diagonal stripe and CLN00816424 cross hatch and compared to a control gene encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase SEAP dark grey . Both the control SEAP cells and the cells transfected with CLN00816424 MGD CSF with a collagen leader increased in number from day 3 through day 6. Cells transfected with CLN00542945 untagged MGD CSF CLN00732663 V5H8 tagged MGD CSF or CLN00821867 streptagged MGD CSF did not proliferate.

As shown in cells transiently transfected with CLN00816424 MGD CSF with a collagen leader remained viable. They maintained greater than 80 viability during 6 days in culture. The viability of the cells in suspension culture was monitored by Trypan Blue exclusion using a hemocytometer from day 3 to day 6 following transfection with CLN00542945 black CLN00732663 light grey CLN00821867 diagonal stripe and CLN00816424 cross hatch and compared to a control gene encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase SEAP dark grey . Cells expressing MGD CSF CLN00732663 and CLN00821867 showed increased cell toxicity evidenced by their decreased viability over time in culture. This toxicity is not specific to MGD CSF cDNA in host 293 cells but rather is observed only under certain culture conditions.

MGD CSF was stably expressed by transfected adherent 293 T cells. Stable transfection was performed in 293 T cells purchased from ATCC Manassas Va. and cultured in complete DMEM medium DMEM medium supplemented with 10 FBS Mediatech Herndon Va. 100 U ml penicillin 100 g ml streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The day before transfection 1.25 10cells were seeded into a T 175 culture flask Corning Acton Mass. and incubated overnight at 37 C. with 5 CO. Cells were transfected by mixing 114 l Fugene6 Roche Nutley N.J. with 1.9 ml RPMI 1640 medium Mediatech Herndon Va. and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Plasmid DNA 19 g full length MGD CSF in pIRESpuro3 BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. was added to the Fugene media mix and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. The lipid DNA mixture was transferred into the T 175 flask and incubated with the cells for 16 hours. The following day the cells were detached with 0.25 trypsin Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and expanded into three T 175 flasks. After approximately 16 hours the cells were attached to the culture vessel and the selection reagent puromycin Invivogen San Diego Calif. was added to a final concentration of 10 g ml. Selection medium was changed once a week and the cell viability monitored for 4 6 weeks. Expression was validated by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal rabbit anti MGD CSF antibody described above.

Adherent 293 T cells stably expressing MGD CSF were adapted to suspension culture in low serum or serum free medium. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 10 ml in FreeStyle medium Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. or in HyQ PF CHO LS medium Hyclone Logan Utah respectively and supplemented with 5 FBS Mediatech Herndon Va. . Suspension cell cultures were maintained at a volume of 50 ml in a 250 ml shake flask and cultured at 37 C. and 5 CO. The medium was changed twice a week and the cells were maintained at a density at or below approximately 10 ml. Cell viability was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion. When viability exceeded 80 the serum concentration was progressively reduced to 3 2 1 then serum free. Transfected cells adapted to conditions of reduced or absent serum. Cell viability and protein yields of 293 T cells transiently expressing untagged MGD CSF was considerably higher after four days in culture in HyQ CHO media with 1 FBS than the viability and yields observed after six days of transient expression in 293 E cells cultured in FreeStyle media with 3 FBS.

Adherent 293 T cells maintained in FreeStyle medium with 3 FBS grew relatively slowly their viability was 67 after three passages. In comparison cells maintained in HyQ PF CHO LS medium with 1 FBS grew more quickly their viability was 85 after four passages. As shown in the protein yields of cultures in HyQ PF CHO LS medium and 1 FBS right panel were increased more than 10 fold compared to the yields from cells cultured in FreeStyle medium supplemented with 3 FBS left panel as determined by quantitative Western blot.

As shown in high protein yields were obtained from stably transfected MGD CSF 293 T cells adapted to grow in suspension culture with low serum or with serum free media as shown by Western blot analysis. Stably transfected MGD CSF 293 T cells adapted to grow in suspension culture with low serum secreted 8 fold more 1.3 g ml panel 1 . Those grown in serum free media secreted 4 fold more 650 ng ml panel 2 MGD CSF into the culture supernatant within 6 days than stably transfected MGD CSF 293 T cells growing adherently as described above for 4 days approximately 160 ng ml panel 3 . MGD CSF expressed in and then purified served as a quantitative standard panel 4 .

As shown in bioreactor fermentation improved MGD CSF productivity to approximately 10 g ml during the course of a 6 7 day fermentation in a 10 liter bioreactor. Cells adapted to grow in low serum were inoculated at a concentration of approximately 5 10 ml into 10 liters of HyQ PF CHO LS medium supplemented with 1 FBS. Fermentation was monitored for 6 days and samples were prepared for gel electrophoresis as described above. The left panel of shows the presence of MGD CSF in a gel loaded with 22.5 l sample per lane and stained with Coomassie Blue on days 1 6 post inoculation. Bovine serum albumin BSA is shown as a quantitative control in the right panel. The arrow indicates the position of MGD CSF.

MGD CSF was isolated from 293T cells grown in suspension cultures stably expressing the protein as described above and shown in . The culture supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 M NaCl pH 5.0 with HCl then concentrated 5 fold with a cellulose membrane having a 10 kD molecular weight cut off Millipore Billerica Mass. . The concentrate was dialyzed against buffer A 10 mM acetic acid pH 5.0 110 mM NaCl and fractionated on a SP Sepharose FF Amersham Piscataway N.J. cation exchange column equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 1.5 M NaCl and the fractions containing MGD CSF were dialyzed against buffer B 10 mM 1 3 diaminopropane pH 8.9 30 mM NaCl .

This dialyzed SP Pool was applied to a heparin Sepharose HP Amersham Piscataway N.J. column equilibrated with buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient to 1.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing MGD CSF were dialyzed against buffer C 10 mM bis trispropane pH 7.4 30 mM NaCl . This dialyzed Hep Pool was fractionated on a QS Sepharose FF Amersham Piscataway N.J. anion exchange column equilibrated in buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient to 1.5 M NaCl. The fractions containing MGD CSF were pooled and this Q Pool was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. This purification procedure recovered a yield of 12 of the expressed protein at 95 purity.

The MGD CSF sequence includes seven cysteine residues located at amino acid positions 35 167 176 178 179 190 and 198. Based on a comparison of denaturing and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis results under non reducing conditions MGD CSF does not form disulfide linked oligomers. Therefore at least one of the cysteine residues in the native protein is expected to be unpaired. Unpaired cysteine residues may lead to improper protein folding and formation of covalent aggregates.

A set of seven muteins of the MGD CSF protein was constructed expressed and characterized in which each of the cysteines was mutated to serine to understand its disulfide bond pattern. This analysis of the disulfide bond pattern can determine whether eliminating one or more free cysteine residues would produce an MGD CSF protein with improved properties for example improved expression and secretion from mammalian cells decreased aggregation of the purified protein and or the potential to produce active recombinant MGD CSF when expressed in

DNA encoding each of the muteins was generated from a construct comprising the collagen signal peptide and the nucleotide sequence encoding mature MGD CSF CLN00848149 . Protein was expressed in 293 T cells as described above. The supernatant was harvested and subjected to reducing and nonreducing gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibody raised to the middle peptide epitope in human MGD CSF.

As shown in the Western blot of the reducing gel was analyzed to determine relative expression levels of wild type human MGD CSF with native or collagen signal peptide and each of the Cys to Ser muteins. The secreted protein yield of wild type human MGD CSF was observed to be higher with the collagen signal peptide than the native signal peptide. All of the muteins were observed to have at least a slightly decreased yield of secreted protein as compared to wild type human MGD CSF with the collagen signal peptide. The yields of C179S and C190S were significantly decreased and C35S was not detectably expressed. Based on these results it is likely that C35 C179 and C190 participate in disulfide bonding in native MGD CSF.

As further shown in the Western blot of the nonreducing gel was analyzed for changes in apparent molecular weight as determined by the relative migration of the MGD CSF species compared with protein standards. When a disulfide bond is disrupted the apparent size of the protein will typically increase under the denaturing conditions of SDS PAGE and the magnitude of this increase will typically be correlated with the distance between the two cysteine residues in the primary sequence of the protein. The disruption of a disulfide bond may lead to the formation of higher molecular weight aggregated species. C167S is observed to have the same migration time as wild type MGD CSF while all of the other muteins have altered migration behavior. This indicates that C167 is likely the only unpaired cysteine in native MGD CSF. C179S and C190S both primarily form higher molecular weight species. These muteins have the same changes in protein yield and migration suggesting that they are paired with one another in native MGD CSF. C176S and C178S show the same slight decrease in migration suggesting that they may be paired with each other in native MGD CSF. Finally C198S has a larger change in migration suggesting that its partner may be C35 which is located further away in the protein sequence. The fact that C167 is likely the only unpaired cysteine in native MGD CSF indicates it may be mutated to a serine or an alanine with a resulting improvement in the yield of the expressed protein and a decrease in the heterogeneity of the recovered protein product.

Mouse NK cells were purified from the spleens of C57BL6 10 week old female mice using the NK cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer s instructions Miltenyi Biotechnology Inc. Auburn Calif. . Approximately 30 000 purified NK cells were incubated with purified MGD CSF at concentrations from 0.01 to 10 ug ml. NK cell numbers were determined using the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit Promega G7571 . As shown in after four days of incubation in RPMI with 5 FBS MGD CSF specifically increased the proliferation and or survival of NK cell numbers in a dose dependent manner.

Human NK cells were isolated and purified from blood enriched in buffy coat cells obtained from the Stanford Blood Center Palo Alto Calif. . The blood was diluted approximately 1 5 with PBS and Ficoll Ficoll Paque Plus Amersham Biosciences Piscataway N.J. added 12.5 ml tube to multiple 50 ml conical tubes each with 25 ml of diluted blood. The Ficoll blood mixture was centrifuged at 450 g for 30 minutes. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell PBMC layers were removed washed with DPBS 1 without calcium and magnesium Mediatech Inc. Prince William Co. VA and pelleted at 1000 RPM for 10 minutes. The PBMCs were washed three times in PBS by centrifugation at 1350 RPM for 10 minutes and resuspended in 40 ml PBS with 0.5 fetal calf serum Gibco Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and 2 mM EDTA Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. PBSFE .

NK cells were enriched from the PBMCs with a human NK Cell Isolation Kit II Miltenyi Biotechnology Inc. Auburn Calif. as recommended by the manufacturer. This enrichment step utilized the deplete program of an autoMACST Separator Miltenyi Biotechnology Inc. Auburn Calif. the negative fraction representing enriched NK cells was collected from outlet port neg1. These cells were centrifuged at 1350 RPM for 10 minutes the cell pellets resuspended in DMEM with 10 fetal calf serum and diluted to a concentration of 1 10cells ml. The cells were incubated with the control and test agents described below for four days at 37 C. in an atmosphere of 7 COin 96 well round bottom plates at a cell concentration of 5 10cells in 50 l DMEM with 10 fetal calf serum per well.

The effect of control and test agents on the proliferation of human NK cells prepared in this manner was determined in a screening assay by measuring the number of viable cells in the culture based on quantitation of ATP by measuring luciferase activity as described in Promega CellTiter Glo Technical Bulletin No. 288 Promega Madison Wis. . Quantitative results were read on an Lmax plate reader Molecular Devices Sunnyvale Calif. at room temperature for 0.6 second well. The ATP content of the wells was measured four days after plating.

As shown in conditioned media from cells transfected with MGD CSF and with cells transfected with plasmid DNA from cluster 190647 the source of the MGD CSF clones stimulated NK cell production. Interferon gamma IFN interleukin 1 IL 1 and GM CSF were used as internal positive controls. External positive controls which include recombinant interleukin 15 and external negative controls which include culture medium are shown on the right and the left of . This screening assay identified MGD CSF as an agent that stimulated the production of and or stabilized the number of NK cells. This result was seen in four independent repetitions of the screening assay. MGD CSF did not consistently induce the production of cytokines from NK cells. It increased or stabilized monocyte cell number but did not induce the production of cytokines from monocytic cells. MGD CSF had no effect on the number of activated T cells or B cells.

MGD CSF also stimulated the proliferation of bone marrow CD34 hematopoietic stem cells HSC cells Cambrex Inc. Baltimore Md. in culture. As shown in MGD CSF increased proliferation in a dose dependent manner. HSC cells were grown in culture under stromal free conditions at a density of 2.4 10cells per well in 12 well tissue culture dishes containing 1 ml well RPMI ATCC supplemented with 5 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ATCC and 10 ng ml recombinant human stem cell factor SCF 10 ng ml Flt3 ligand Flt3L R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. in a 5 COincubator at 37 C. for 1 2 weeks washed with PBS lifted with 0.5 ml Versene Gibco BRL Gaithersburg Md. washed again with PBS resuspended in 1 ml PBS 0.1 BSA Sigma St. Louis Mo. and counted with a hematocytometer. Purified MGD CSF increased their growth in a dose dependent manner from 20 ng ml to 500 ng ml. MGD CSF induced stem cell proliferation to a greater extent than M CSF and to a similar extent as G CSF and GM CSF.

Human primary monocytes were purified from PBMC using a protocol modified from a previously described method de Almeida et al. 95 221 223 2000 . To isolate human PBMC from blood the buffy coat was diluted in a six fold volume of PBS then overlain onto 20 ml Ficoll in a 50 ml tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 2 000 rpm at 22 C. for 20 minutes without the use of the centrifuge brake. The PMBC cells were collected from the interface washed with PBS twice then resuspended in RPMI 5 FBS and filtered through a BD Falcon cell strainer. To purify the primary untouched monocytes from PBMC six ml of the PBMC suspension containing 70 120 10cells was carefully and slowly overlain onto 10 ml hyperosmotic Percoll. The cells were centrifuged at a speed of 580 g for 15 minutes without the use of the centrifuge brake. Cells at the interface were collected and washed with 50 ml of RPMI 5 FBS. This purified monocyte cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml RPMI 5 FBS.

The monocyte assay was performed by incubating approximately 30 000 purified monocytes with MGD CSF purified as described above. After four days of incubation in RPMI with 5 FBS monocyte proliferation was determined using the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit Promega G7571 .

Conditioned medium from MGD CSF transfected 293 T cells MGD CSF CM promoted monocyte proliferation. The screening assay was performed in duplicate plates in a 96 well plate format on monocytes activated by mouse IgG2a. Table 6 shows semiquantitative descriptions of the potency of the activity of each clone to stimulate monocyte proliferation and the degree of expression of each construct. MGD CSF CM stimulated monocyte proliferation to approximately the same extent as GM CSF. Results were considered significant when at least two standard deviations from the median. The observed EDwas 3 5 ng ml. Mutant MGD CSF proteins were also tested in this assay. The mutant clone CLN00848185 demonstrated activity potency comparable to the wild type protein and other mutant clones had slightly lower activities than the wild type protein suggesting that some mutant proteins can be used as therapeutic proteins.

As shown in the stimulatory effect of MGD CSF CM on monocyte proliferation was dose dependent over a 10.000 fold range. The lowest dose of MGD CSF CM tested 0.01 l had no significant effect on monocyte proliferation. Increasing the dose 10 fold to 0.1 l MGD CSF CM induced cell proliferation to a significant level compared to controls. Further increasing the dose to 1 l MGD CSF CM and 10 l MGD CSF CM further increased monocyte proliferation in a dose dependent manner. No dose dependency was observed with the empty vector or the negative controls CLN003732 or FPT026. The effect of a single dose of 10 ng ml GM CSF a stimulatory positive control is shown as well as the effect of the negative control IL 10 and of unconditioned medium.

As shown in both purified GM CSF and conditioned media from cells transfected with MGD CSF stimulated human monycyte proliferation. Thus MGD CSF functions as an agonist of monocyte proliferation in addition to its role in the differentiation and growth of myeloid cells and granulocytes. It may be used as a hematopoietic factor to enhance the recovery of hematopoietic cells following chemotherapy or radiation treatment and bone marrow transplantation in cancer patients.

To understand the role of MGD CSF in vivo C57BL6 mice were injected with MGD CSF plasmid DNA using a method described by Wang et al. 63 9016 9022 2003 . The human cytochrome P450 3A4 promoter was operably linked to a nucleic acid molecule with the nucleotide sequence of MGD CSF and injected into the tail vein of a mouse in order to transfect the mouse s liver with MGD CSF. The human 3A4 promoter was used to drive the expression of MGD CSF in mouse liver. A complete blood count CBC and differential analysis was performed on the control and experimental groups in each of two independent experiments using a Serono Baker 9000 hematology analyzer.

The control group Table 7A animals 1 3 in the first experiment comprised three uninjected mice age matched to the experimental mice. The experimental group Table 7A animals 4 6 in the first experiment comprised three mice injected with naked MGD CSF DNA via the tail vein. Blood samples were collected on day 14 following injection. As shown in Table 7A the injected mice had elevated monocyte counts compared to the controls. Control animals 1 2 and 3 had 94 84 and 52 monocytes l blood respectively. Experimental animals 4 and 6 had 216 and 268 monocytes l blood respectively. No meaningful monocyte count was obtained for animal 3.

The control group Table 7B animals 1 6 in the second experiment comprised six mice age matched to the experimental mice and injected via the tail vein with a LacZ construct. The experimental group Table 7B animals 7 12 in the second experiment comprised six mice injected with naked MGD CSF DNA via the tail vein. Blood samples were collected on day 21 following injection. As shown in Table 7B the injected mice had elevated monocyte counts compared to the controls. None of the control animals had detectable monocyte levels. Four of the six experimental animals had detectable monocyte levels ranging from 50 78 monocytes l. These results demonstrate that MGD CSF increased myeloid cell numbers in vivo.

In vitro granulocyte monocyte and dendritic cell development assays further revealed the function of MGD CSF in hematopoeisis. Human bone marrow CD34 hematopoietic stem cells HSC cells Cambrex Inc. Baltimore Md. were cultured as described above.

Differentiation was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis using fluorescently labeled antibodies to detect the differentiation markers on the granulocyte cell surface Kavathas et al. 80 524 528 1983 . After one week culture in either the presence or absence of MGD CSF G CSF GM CSF or M CSF the BM CD34 cells were washed once with PBS lifted with 0.5 ml Versene Gibco BRL Gaithersburg Md. washed with 1 ml PBS 0.1 BSA Sigma St. Louis Mo. resuspended in 0.2 ml PBS 0.1 BSA Sigma St. Louis Mo. and aliquoted 50 l per well into a 96 well plate for FACS staining Cells were incubated with fluorescent conjugated antibodies for 15 minutes at 4 C. After washing twice with 150 l PBS 0.1 BSA the cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur per manufacturer s instruction Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes N.J. . 10 ng ml G CSF 10 ng ml M CSF or 30 ng ml GM CSF from R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. served for positive controls of the effects of known growth factors. Fluorescent conjugated antibodies specific for granulocyte monocyte or dendritic lineage specific surface markers were purchased from BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. and used to determine the effect of MGD CSF on differentiation of HSC cells to granulocytic monocytic and dendritic lineages.

As shown in MGD CSF stimulated the differentiation of granulocytes from undifferentiated cells to differentiated granulocytes possessing the differentiation markers CD67 and CD24. As a negative control the baseline level of granulocyte differentiation in the presence of empty vector and the absence of cytokine was measured to be 12 . The positive control G CSF stimulated 55 of the granulocytes to differentiate. MGD CSF CM stimulated 41 of the granulocytes to differentiate arrow . The effect of MGD CSF was synergistic with that of G CSF in the presence of both 64 of the granulocytes were stimulated to differentiate.

CD24 and CD15 antibodies were used to monitor granulocyte differentiation. The CD24 antibody reacted with a 35 45 kDa two chain glycoprotein expressed on the surface of B cells and granulocytes. The CD15 antibody reacted with 3 fucosyl N acetyllactosamine 3 FAL a 220 kDa carbohydrate structure also known as X hapten. 3 FAL was expressed on 95 of the granulocytes examined including neutrophils and eosinophils and to a varying degree on monocytes but not on lymphocytes or basophils. CD15 plays a role in mediating phagocytosis bactericidal activity and chemotaxis. Cells positive for both CD24 and CD15 represent granulocytes which have differentiated from the BM CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells.

As shown in 20 ng ml and 100 ng ml MGD CSF induced 3 differentiation to CD15 CD24 granulocytes and 500 ng ml MGD CSF induced 8 differentiation to CD15 CD24 granulocytes. The positive controls G CSF and GM CSF both induced 12 of bone marrow CD34 cells to differentiate into CD15 CD24 positive granulocytes.

As shown in MGD CSF stimulated the differentiation of monocytes from undifferentiated cells to differentiated monocytes possessing the CD14 marker. As a negative control the baseline level of monocyte differentiation in the presence of empty vector and the absence of cytokine was measured to be 24 . GM CSF stimulated 20 of the monocytes to differentiate. MGD CSF stimulated 45 of the monocytes to differentiate arrow . Although GM CSF alone had no effect on these cells when combined with MGD CSF its effect was synergistic in the presence of both 55 of the monocytes were stimulated to differentiate.

As shown in CD14 and CD16 antibodies were used to monitor monocyte differentiation. The CD14 antibody reacted with a 53 55 kD glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPI anchored single chain glycoprotein expressed at high levels on monocytes. Additionally the CD14 antibody reacted with some macrophages. The CD16 antibody reaced with the 50 65 kDa transmembrane form of IgG Fc receptor FcgRIII . CD16 antigen was expressed on monocytes macrophages granulocytes and NK cells. Monocytes can be divided into two subsets according to their CD16 expression resident monocytes are CD14CD16 and inflammatory monocytes are CD14CD16. 20 ng ml MGD CSF induced 30 differentiation 100 ng ml MGD CSF induced 30 differentiation and 500 ng ml induced 53 differentiation to either CD14 CD16 or CF14CD16 monocytes. The positive controls G CSF GM CSF and M CSF promoted 41 38 and 51 CD14 differentiation respectively.

As shown in MGD CSF stimulated the differentiation of dendritic cells from undifferentiated cells to differentiated dendritic cells possessing the CD86 and CD1 markers. As a negative control the baseline level of dendritic cell differentiation in the presence of empty vector was measured to be 4 . MGD CSF stimulated 22 of the undifferentiated cells to differentiate into dendritic cells.

To assess stimulatory effects of MGD CSF on human bone marrow derived myeloid CFU G CFU M and CFU GM progenitor proliferation colony formation assays were performed. The positive controls for stimulation of myeloid progenitors were the addition of G CSF at 0.1 ng ml 1 ng ml and 10 ng ml and GM CSF at 0.01 ng ml 0.1 ng ml and 3 ng ml. MGD CSF protein was diluted into methylcellulose based media for each test concentration to final concentrations of 20 100 and 500 ng ml. Cells were added such that each of three replicate cultures contained 3 10cells. The replicate cultures were incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 14 days then counted photographed classified on the basis of morphology as CFU G CFU M or CFU GM and FACS analysis was performed. Statistical analyses were performed to assess changes in colony number size and morphology. MGD CSF promoted formation of CFU G CFU M CFU GM and total colony formation. In addition as further described below MGD CSF promoted large CFU M colonies distinct from those promoted by G CSF or GM CSF. These results suggest that MGD CSF enhanced early hematopoietic progenitor formation.

As shown in MGD CSF was tested for its biological effects in assays that measure non activated B cell proliferation BPro4 ability to stimulate glucose uptake by adipocytes Gu2Gy3T3 unactivated monocyte proliferation MonPro4 NK cell proliferation and or survival NKGlo T cell proliferation TPro4 activated primary B cell proliferation aBPro4 activated primary monocyte proliferation aMonPro3 and activated primary T cell proliferation aTPro4 . Results were considered significant if they were at least two standard deviations from the median. MGD CSF specifically stimulated the proliferation of NK cells and unactivated monocytes without stimulating the proliferation of activated monocytes or the proliferation of either activated or unactivated B cells or T cells.

As shown in MGD CSF was tested for its biological effect on cytokine secretion from NK cells. Assays were performed as described in Example 11. Conditioned medium was removed at the end of the experiment to determine the type and amount of cytokine secretion using the Luminex cytokine assay kit from Linco Inc. St. Charles Mo. according to the manufacturer s instructions. Results were considered significant if they were at least two standard deviations from the median. MGD CSF stimulated the secretion of GM CSF IL 12 and IL 13.

MGD CSF increased the size as well as the number of myeloid colonies formed from human bone marrow cells in a dose dependent manner. The top left panel of shows a representative photograph of CFU M colonies observed in bone marrow cells cultured the absence of cytokine buffer . Evidence of colony formation is weak or absent. The top middle panel shows a representative photograph of CFU M colonies induced by GM CSF colony formation was apparent. The top right panel shows a representative photograph which demonstrates that G CSF does not stimulate CFU M formation. The bottom three panels of show representative photographs of CFU Ms induced by MGD CSF. Both the number and the size increased in a dose dependent manner between 20 ng ml and 500 ng ml MGD CSF. The cells were examined and photographed with an Axiovert 25 microscope and AxioCam HRc both from Carl Zeiss Gottingen Germany using a 40 lens. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss KS300 3.0 digital imaging system.

The size of the colonies induced by MGD CSF were larger than those induced by GM CSF. Approximately 10 of the colonies induced by MGD CSF were extremely large in the range of 100 2000 microns. MGD CSF induced these large colonies both in the presence and absence of the cytokines SCF and IL 3. These data show that MGD CSF promoted the formation of early myeloid progenitors including progenitors earlier than GM CSF or G CSF. They also suggest that MGD CSF promotes the differentiation of either or both of the M1 or M2 macrophage lineage.

Human bone marrow CD34 cells Cambrex Inc. Baltimore Md. were plated on 24 well cell culture plates in serum free X Vivo 20 medium Cambrex Inc. Baltimore Md. and treated with vector control conditioned medium CM or MGD CSF CM. The cells were examined and photographed with an Axiovert 25 microscope and AxioCam HRc both from Carl Zeiss Gottingen Germany using a 40 lens. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss KS300 3.0 digital imaging system.

As shown in increasing numbers of elongated cells were observed in the MGD CSF treated cultures with increasing MGD CSF concentrations. Anti CD1a antibody was used to determine differentiation into dendritic cells. Treating the cultures with MGD CSF for two weeks induced the differentiation of 20 of the human bone marrow CD34 into CD1a positive dendritic cells. MGD CSF induced the differentiation of dendritic cells from human bone marrow cells in a dose dependent manner . The cells shown in all four panels were examined and photographed with an Axiovert 25 microscope and AxioCam HRc both from Carl Zeiss Gottingen Germany using a 40 lens. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss KS300 3.0 digital imaging system.

The top left panel of shows a representative photograph of bone marrow cells cultured the absence of cytokine medium . The cells are typically small and rounded. The top right panel shows a representative photograph of the bone marrow cells elongating and flattening to more closely resemble dendritic cells in response to 20 ng ml MGD CSF. The bottom left panel shows a representative photograph which demonstrates that a higher dose of MGD CSF 100 ng ml has a more pronounced effect on the morphology of the HSC cells. The cells are larger and more elongated. The bottom right panel shows that a concentration of 500 ng ml MGD CSF resulted in large flat elongated cells with the morphological appearance of dendritic cells.

The differential level of gene expression was compared in individual human cancer tissue specimens by interrogating a proprietary oncology database from GeneLogic using the Affymetrix GeneChip array platform the Human Genome U133 and U133Plus2 Affymetrix Inc Santa Clara Calif. with probe 237046 x at. It was also compared by interrogating microarray chips designed by Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. with probes PRB107386 and PRB107386 at. These probes were used to determine the expression of MGD CSF in the tissues of patients with hyperproliferative hematologic abnormalities. This analysis identified differential gene expression patterns between different tissue types and different disease stages. Table 8 column 3 lists the number of disease specimens that tested positive for the presence of MGC34647 MGC34647 Positive . Table 8 column 4 lists the number of specimens examined Total Gene Logic . MGD CSF was expressed in most patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The percent of patients expressing MGD CSF varied with the observed pathology and was highest in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts or ringed sideroblasts. Half of the patients with acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia expressed MGD CSF. A subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia expressed MGD CSF. The percentage varied from 14 25 depending on the pathological presentation of the disease. MGD CSF was generally not expressed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia.
