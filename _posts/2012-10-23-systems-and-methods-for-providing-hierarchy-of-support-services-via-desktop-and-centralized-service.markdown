B. Systems and Methods for Delivering Technical Support Via a Hybrid of Local and Remote Support Services

The systems and methods of the centralized remote technical support services described herein may also be deployed for local onsite services. In these embodiments the solution uses remote services technology to deliver the most appropriate trained technical resource to resolve the customer needs at the customer s home or location. The innovative application of the centralized technology discussed herein with innovative modification to skills and processes for local onsite service improves and optimizes the amount of cost required to deliver services to the home. Without the use of the technology and processes described herein one or more technicians visits the consumer s home or location for an indeterminate period of time and for additional appointments to be scheduled when the work exceeds either the time or the skill of the one or more technicians.

By using the systems and methods described herein the skills of the technician visiting the home may be redefined or re scoped to be associated with connecting devices and enabling connection of the computers to a network or the Internet. The amount of time to perform these tasks is more deterministic and requires a much more focused set of skills. For example an onsite service home service technician may be dispatched for hour hour or other predetermined time increments to perform a preliminary diagnostics and to setup up the service work to the Intelligent Switch much like the store associate in the consumer outlet scenarios described above. Once the interconnection of the consumer device is complete and the device is hooked up to the Intelligent Switch remote resources from the centralized service may be connected to complete all the necessary installations configurations training and repairs. As such in these embodiments appropriate skilled resources are applied without the need to send additional technicians to the consumer s location. The onsite technician may leave to attend other service calls once the device is hooked up to the Intelligent Switch.

A typical example scenario for a local onsite service is that a consumer may call for help because his or her computer is slow lost connectivity to the Internet experiencing lots of pop ups and or perhaps would like to install some new devices. A technician may be assigned a time frame of 1 3 hours reserved to perform the work. When the technician arrives on site he or she may diagnose the problem and may start with a set of tools to fix the problem and then proceed to hook the computer up to the Internet or verify connectivity to the Internet. Once done the technician may start to install new devices and software onto the computer. Without the use of the centralized remote technical services described herein much of the time spent on site is watching the tools fix the problems as they can take a long time to scan and automatically fix problems. In some cases the technician may run out of time or that there will be aspects of the work that will require another visit by a technician with a different set of skills. With the user of the centralized remote technical services described herein a predetermined amount of time may be set for the technician for an onsite visit such as a 1 hour appointment. In that time period the technician may perform a diagnostics and connect and configure the device to be connected to the Intelligent Switch and pool of remote technical resources. The onsite technician may go to another place to do the same work another home visit for a predetermined amount of time after leaving the computer connected to the centralized remote technical support service. At that point the computer may be assigned from a queue to a remote technician to perform the desired service based on the onsite technician s diagnostics description of the problem or information submitted to the Intelligent Switch. The remote technician for example may clean and update the software and configuration of the computer and install any new devices. In addition the remote technician may deliver training to the consumer at his home such as live one on one training If the remote technician performing the service is not the best or appropriate resource to perform the service the connection to the consumer s computer may be transferred electronically and real time to the next appropriate technician with out the need to reschedule an onsite visit.

Via the connection the remote connectivity tool has access to the desktop of the remote device as such that the user has access to the desktop remotely as if the user was on the device locally. If any user gains control of or use of the remote connectivity tool they will have the same access to the desktop. It may be desired to provide different levels of access for different users via the same connection as well as not allowing certain support agents access via the connection to the desktop of the remote device. The systems and methods described herein provide different levels of access via the same connection to different support agents and may provides such access via a user interface separate from the desktop view provided by the connection to the device. In this manner a single connection may be used but the type and kind of access to the desktop is secured controlled and managed.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for controlling and managing different levels of access via the same connection to a remote device is depicted. In brief overview a centralized service via remote connectivity tool may establish via network a remote connection to a remote device . The remote connection established by remote connectivity tool may provide or give full access to the desktop of the remote device for example such as a user may view and perform actions remotely on the desktop of the remote device as if the user was locally logged in and accessing the desktop. Instead of providing some agents applications or systems full access to the desktop the centralized service such as via the support automation tool may provide different levels of access to different agents different applications and or different systems. For example the support automation tool may provide via a support user interface separate from a desktop view provided by the remote connectivity tool may display only the actions for the level of access granted to the particular support agent. When such a support agent selects or initiation one of these actions on the remote device the support automation tool on behalf of the support agent executes that action via the remote connection without giving the support agent access to the desktop of the remote device.

In further details the remote connectivity tool may establish a remote connection to the remote device that provides a predetermined level of access to the remote device which may generally referred to as full access or desktop access. The level of access via the remote connection provided by the remote connectivity tool may include full access to the desktop of the remote device. The level of access may include unlimited access to the desktop of the remote device. The level of access may include the same access to the desktop of the remote device as any user with credentials to access the desktop. For example the level of access via the remote connection provided by the remote connectivity tool may include the same views and actions that an administrative user has locally on the remote device. With this level of access a remote user via the remote connectivity tool may view the entire desktop of the remote device as if the user was a local user of the remote device. The predetermined level of access provided via the connection by the remote connectivity tool may be considered the highest or fullest or an unlimited level of access in view of the different levels of access that may be granted and or provided.

The centralized service via any of its components described herein may maintain and manage different levels of access for users such as remote technicians A N applications such as support automation tool and or systems such as third party systems for use and access of the connection to the remote device. Each of the different levels of access may comprises access that includes a subset of actions that a user may have via the predetermined level of access provided by the remote connectivity tool via the connection. Each or some of the different levels of access may include access only via a separate user interface such as the support user interface described elsewhere herein. Each or some of the different levels of access may exclude access via the remote connectivity tool to the desktop of the remote device. That is in some embodiments a user assigned a certain level of access may not have access to the desktop of the remote device. The user may not view or control the desktop of the remote device provided by the predetermined level of access . In such cases the user may have indirect access via other means including the support UI the support automation tool or the centralized service acting on behalf of the user. In some cases for a certain level of access a user may only have the support automation tool on behalf of the user transmit and execute executables such as local automation services via the remote connection .

Each level of access in the plurality of different levels of access may correspond to permitted set of actions services or support that a remote technician may perform on a remote device. Each level of access may have a different set of actions services or support that a remote technician may perform on the remote device. In some embodiments one level of access may comprise the permitted actions services or support of another level of access plus additional permitted actions. In some embodiments one or more levels of access may have actions services or support not overlapping with another level of access. In some embodiments one or more levels of access may have actions services or support that overlap with another layer of access.

In some embodiments the remote connectivity tool may provide different levels of access via the remote connection. In view of the predetermined level of access to the desktop the remote connectivity tool may provide various limited levels of access to the desktop via the remote connection. For example the remote connectivity tool may provide different levels of access that limits a user s access to certain menu items functions or other operations via the desktop. So although the user may see all or a portion of the desktop of the remote device the remote connectivity tool prevents or disables a predetermined set of tasks functions or operations on the remote device via the connection and or view of the desktop. In some embodiments for certain levels of access the remote connectivity tool limits the remote view of the user to the desktop via the remote connection to certain portions of the desktop.

The centralized service may identify and or determine a level of access from the plurality of different levels of access to assign and or grant a remote technician based on any one or more of the following issues with the remote device type of service to be performed on the remote device capabilities of the remote technician and the level of service and or services entitled to be provided to the remote device. For identifying and or determining a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician the centralized service may use any of the embodiments of the systems and methods described herein for assigning a task or request for service to a work queue for identifying and or determining a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician. For identifying and or determining a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician the centralized service may use any of the same embodiments of the systems and methods described herein for assigning a task or request for service to a remote technique and or a remote technician to a work for queue. For example when assigning a remote technique to a task request or work queue the centralized service may also assign a level of access based on the same decision. In another example the centralized service may identify and or determine a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician based a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician such as based on the skill sets capabilities and or knowledge that they have and type of work or service they may perform. For example the centralized service may identify and or determine a level of access from the different levels of access to assign and or grant to a remote technician based on profiles for each of the remote technicians which may identify the technical capabilities certifications types of service or work authorized or assigned to perform and or performance information and statistics for past service work.

Based on the level of access assigned to or determined for a remote technician the support automation tool may present and or display via a user interface separate from the view of the desktop such as the support UI a predetermined set of actions permitted granted or allowed for that level of access. For example if a remote technician is assigned to a level of access that limits the actions the remote technician may take via the connection to collecting data such as telemetry data the support automation tool via the support UI may present to the remote technician a limited set of actions corresponding to collecting data. The user such as a remote technician may select or initiate the set of actions corresponding to the level of access. The centralized service may execute on behalf of the remote technician such actions via the remote connection. As such the remote technician in such embodiments may not access the remote device via the desktop provided by the remote connection but only indirectly via the control and management of the centralized service.

The support automation tool and separate UI of the support automation tool provide a level of abstraction and or a layer of security and control from the predetermined level of access such as the full access provided via the remote connectivity tool. This may referred to as a walled garden approach to providing access via the remote connection. A walled garden refers to the centralized service s control over access and use of the remote connection and or access and use of the desktop of the remote device while restricting access to non approved uses. The centralized service determines which remote technicians services and executables gain access via the remote connection to the remote device and in which manner such as via a separate UI and controlled execution by the support automation tool.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for controlling and managing different levels of access via the same connection to a remote device is depicted is depicted. In brief overview at step a support request is initiated on remote device. At step the remote connectivity tool established a remote connection to the remote device. At step the centralized service determines a level of access for remote technician. At step the centralized service provides an enumerated list of actions via user interface separate from the desktop and that correspond to level of access. At step the centralized service receives a request from the remote support agent via the separate user interface to perform of the actions. At step the centralized services performs the action on behalf of the remote support agent such as by transmitting an executable via the remote connection to perform the action on the remote device.

In further detail steps and step may include any embodiments of these steps as described in connection with . Upon establishing the remote connection the remote connectivity tool establishes or provides a predetermined level of access to the desktop of the remote device such as full access to the desktop. The remote connectivity tool may provide a predetermined level of access to the desktop corresponding to the same access as a user of the remote device such as an administrative user. In some cases only a user of the centralized service granted a level of access to the remote connectivity tool can access and view the desktop of the remote device via the remote connection.

At step the centralized service determines from the plurality of different levels of access a level of access for a remote technician to work on the remote device. Based on any combination of the type of service or issue of the remote device and capabilities of the remote technician the centralized service may determine the appropriate level of access to grant the remote technician in using the same connection of the remote connectivity tool. For each of the different remote technicians who may perform service or work on the remote device the centralized service may determine and grant different levels of access.

At step the centralized service provides a list of actions to the remote technician corresponding to or permitted by the level of access assigned or granted to the remote technician. The centralized service enumerates a list of actions permitted by the level of access via a user interface separate from any user interface or view such as the desktop view provided by the remote connectivity tool and a predetermined level of access . The centralized service such as via the support automation tool may display the list of actions for the level of access to the remote technician via the device and display of the device of the remote technician. Instead of seeing or viewing the desktop of the remote device the remote technician sees or views a separate user interface without any direct access to the desktop of the remote device.

At step the centralized service receives a request from the remote technician to perform one of the actions the remote technician is permitted in accordance with the level of access to execute on the remote device. Via the separate user interface displayed on the device of the remote technician the remote technician may select a user interface element corresponding to the action to execute. The centralized service such as via the support automation tool may receive this selection. Via the separate user interface displayed on the device of the remote technician the remote technician may select or request the execution of the selected action. The centralized service such as via the support automation tool may receive this request to execution the selected action.

At step the centralized service performs the action on behalf of the remote technician via the remote connection. The support automation tool may select and transmit an executable such as a local automation service described herein via the remote connection. The support automation tool may transmit the executable to the remote device and have the executable executed on the remote device to perform the desired action.

Instead of the remote technician performing the action on the remote device via the desktop view provided by the remote connectivity tool the centralized service may via the support automation tool may perform the action via the remote connection on behalf of the remote technician. As such in some embodiments only the action requested can be and is performed via the remote connection without the opportunity for the remote technician to perform an unauthorized or inadvertent action not corresponding to the remote technician s level of access.

The systems and methods for providing walled garden access to the remote device via the remote connection may be further illustrated by the embodiments of below for the delivery of automated services via configurable based on entitlement of the user to the services and or capabilities of the support agent.

Referring now to systems and methods of present solution provide for the delivery of automated services via configurable packages that are selectable on a user interface by a support agent based on entitlement of the user to the services and or capabilities of the support agent. For example a centralized service may package a complex set of actions into configurable executable scripts or packages. The centralized service may deliver and execute the packages on the remote device to resolve a customer s issue. The centralized service may provide a user interface for a support agent to select and deliver the package to the remote device. The centralized service may determine whether or not the user is entitled to receive the service represented by the package. If the user is so entitled the centralized service may enable a single button on the user interface selectable by the support agent to deliver the package to the remote device. If the user is not entitled the centralized service may disable or not provide this button on the user interface. The centralized service may determine whether or not the support agent is qualified to deliver or provide the service represented by the package. If the support agent is qualified the centralized service may enable a single button on the user interface selectable by the support agent to deliver the package to the remote device. If the support agent is not entitled the centralized service may disable or not provide this button on the user interface. Based on a combination of user entitled and support agent capabilities the centralized service may display and or enable single user interface elements to deliver a complex set of actions in a single package to a remote device.
