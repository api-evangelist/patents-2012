title: Truncated V underbody protection enhancement
abstract: A mechanism protecting vehicle occupants from floor oscillation during under-vehicle explosions comprises vehicle cab sidewalls, a cab floor, cab mounts having elastomeric bodies between the cab and vehicle frame members, a shield below the cab floor, first elastomeric isolators between the shield and frame, and second elastomeric isolators between the shield and sidewalls. The second isolators collapse by an amount equal to the combined collapse of the first isolators and cab mounts. Explosive loads to the shield follow paths to different floor zones, decreasing floor oscillation. A vehicle payload area is mounted to the frame separately from the cab. The payload area and cab move independently on the frame. The payload area mounts are stiffer and smaller than the cab mounts, so explosions under the vehicle tend to accelerate the payload area before the cab.

The invention is within the area of technology associated with protecting vehicles and their occupants from explosions of mines or improvised explosive devices typically encountered by military vehicles in combat zones. Generally this technology involves adding armor to the underside of vehicles and specially shaping the lower hulls of the vehicles typically armored V shaped hulls or somewhat V shaped hulls are used to protect the vehicles and the vehicle occupants. One problem that has been encountered in some vehicle designs is that the floor of the cab or cabin of the vehicle oscillates violently as a result of an under vehicle explosion. The oscillation is known to injure the occupants of the vehicle the lower limbs of the occupants being particularly vulnerable to the effects of floor oscillation. The invention herein mitigates blast induced floor oscillation by controlling the paths of blast forces passed to the floor and by providing force dampening isolators in each path. The invention also utilizes the inertia of vehicle components such as the drive train and cargo or payload area to absorb force loads originating from an under vehicle explosion.

It is already known to employ a truncated V shaped hull or a shallow V hull on a vehicle to enhance its ability to resist or survive mine blasts or similar explosions occurring under the vehicle. Such employment is shown for example by US Patent application 2008 0066613 A1 to Mills et al. Mills at FIG. 6 also shows an energy absorbing structure between the truncated V hull and the cab area. The energy absorption structure is comprised of a framework of sacrificial struts or beams reinforcing the lower vehicle hull. An underbody blast shield mounted to the vehicle via shock absorbers is shown in U.S. patent Application Publication 2010 0307329 A1 of Kaswen et al. U.S. Patent Application 2012 0174767 A1 for Naroditsky et al shows a shallow V belly armor plate under a vehicle cab and attached to sidewalls of a vehicle the belly armor plate has an upper and lower layer between which is an energy absorbing structure. Drive train components have been used in prior art vehicles to absorb a portion of the blast force from explosions under the vehicle so that the vehicle hull experienced a reduced effect from the blast force as seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4 492 282 to Appelblatt. More specifically Appelblatt s FIG. 6 shows drive train elements beneath a generally shallow V shaped lower hull of a vehicle. Prior technology also shows using a component having high mass and inertia within the lower hull portion of a V hull structure see FIG. 3B and paragraph 0037 of US Patent Application 2007 0234896 A1 to Joynt now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 357 062. Additionally FIG. 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 8 033 208 B2 to Joynt shows components disposed between two lower hull V shaped sections.

The invention is an improvement to vehicle structure it is a mechanism for better protecting occupants of a vehicle from floor oscillation resulting from an explosion under the vehicle. The mechanism utilizes a pair of vehicle frame members and a vehicle cab having side walls and a floor fixed to the side walls the mechanism preferably also utilizes a vehicle payload area such as a load bed. Cab mounts having elastomeric bodies are disposed between the frame members and the cab and payload area mounts having elastomeric bodies are disposed between the frame members and the payload area. The cab and payload area are mounted separately to the frame members and are not directly connected to each other whereby relative motion between the cab and the frame members is independent of relative motion between the payload area and the frame members. The cab mount elastomeric bodies are more compliant and vertically thicker than the elastomeric bodies of the payload area mounts. By this design feature the payload area tends to be accelerated upward before the cab is and the payload area absorbs force load from the blast before blast force load reaches the cab. A rigid shield made of armor material and configured as a truncated V is disposed below the floor of the cab. First elastomeric isolators are disposed between the shield and the frame members. Second elastomeric isolators are disposed between lateral edges of the shield and the cab s side walls. Automotive components such as a vehicle transmission and a transfer case are affixed to the frame members at a position beneath the cab floor. In the event of an under vehicle explosion the distance through which the second isolators collapse is equal to the combined collapsing distance of the first isolators and the cab mounts whereby explosive loads experienced by the shield travel along separate force paths to different zones of the floor so as to decrease oscillation of the floor.

The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.

The singular forms such as a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example reference to a material includes reference to one or more of such materials and an element includes reference to one or more of such elements.

As used herein substantial and about when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material dimension characteristic parameter and the like refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly substantially free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition characteristic or property. Particularly assemblies that are identified as being substantially free of are either completely absent of the characteristic or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.

Concentrations values dimensions amounts and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub range is explicitly recited. For example a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units 3 dimensional units 10 dimensional units and the like and sub ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units and the like.

Oscillation as used in this application can include a single motion such as the rise of a vehicle cab floor and can include the subsequent fall of the floor oscillation as used herein can include as a series of oscillating motions and includes motions in any given direction not just a vertical direction.

For a vehicle and a system mounted on or used in connection with the vehicle forward reverse longitudinal and vertical up down directions are generally relative to the vehicle and system as typically operated e.g. when the vehicle is operated with the respective powertrain in a forward reverse mode . As such lateral left right directions are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal vertical plane and are referenced from a vehicle operator e.g. driver perspective. A first direction e.g. forward and a second direction e.g. rearward or reverse where the second direction substantially but not necessarily wholly opposes the first direction are also generally or used in connection with the vehicle. Likewise elements located mounted positioned placed installed etc. on near or proximate to the vehicle body are generally referred to as inner while elements that are distal or more remote to the vehicle body are generally referred to as outer unless otherwise noted. As such inner elements are generally closer to the vehicle body than outer elements.

In is shown a vehicle having a generic body and frame assembly that is adapted to accommodate my shield comprised of a truncated underbody V structure. The shield enhances vehicle occupant protection from explosions beneath the vehicle. Assembly includes a cab and a cargo carrying unit or payload area which can be a pick up truck bed or an enclosed box like container. Alternatively the payload area can be any other conventional cargo transport structure such as for example a flat bed or a tank for transporting liquids. Assembly has a pair of parallel frame members which are each comprised of a fore frame member section and an aft frame member section . The parallel relation between the frame members can be seen in wherein both fore frame member sections are shown. Cab and unit are not connected directly to each other although they are both attached to frame members respectively by cab mounts and payload area mounts . By this arrangement relative motion between the cab and the frame members is independent of relative motion between the payload area and the frame members.

Normally cab mounts are attached to cab by mount brackets whereas payload area mounts attach directly to cargo unit . In is a detail view of a cab mount and its connections to cab and fore frame member section . Member section has a frame arm affixed to and extending laterally from member section . Cab has brackets affixed thereto. An elastomeric body of cab mount is sandwiched between bracket and frame arm . The respective mounts are conventional in structure and incorporate elastomeric bodies such as disks or toroid shaped components which absorb or dampen shocks. Cab mounts have softer more compliant elastomeric bodies than do payload area mounts . Cab mounts are thicker or of greater vertical dimension than the payload area mounts so that cab is disposed further from frame members than is payload area .

Affixed upon on the upper surface of shield are four brackets or straps by which the shield is attached to frame member sections as perhaps best seen in . Straps are typically made of steel and form openings with shield through which pass elastomeric frame isolators . Isolators have a cross section as seen in and have a base which faces against the upper surface of shield . Isolators define an upper channel seating frame member sections and optionally define a plurality of elongate voids or through holes to allow frame isolators to be compressed relatively easily as the voids or holes collapse. Isolators still deform once the holes or voids collapse albeit at much higher loads.

The compressibility of isolators enhances vehicle performance in one respect. During vehicle operation frame members twist or bend particularly if the vehicle is traversing rough terrain. Shield is a rigid plate of armor and if it is affixed solidly to the frame members the frame members may be stiffened more than is desired for optimum vehicle travel. Isolators prevent shield from inhibiting the normal deformation of the frame members during vehicle travel and allow installation of shield on a vehicle without modifying the vehicle frame.

Fixed along the outer edges of lateral zones and forming part of the shield are elongate triangularly cross sectioned shoulders . The shoulders stiffen and strengthen shield and also support elastomeric wall isolators whose cross section is shown in . The bottom of isolator faces against shoulder and has a top channel . In conjunction with it will be seen that side walls of cab are seated in channels of wall isolators . Fixed to sidewalls and spanning the distance between them is cab floor so that the isolators cushioning of sidewalls affords shock absorption for the floor as well. Isolator defines one or more enclosed voids or else forms a through aperture such that isolator is essentially a tube with a channel along its top as seen in . Aperture allows isolator to be compressed relatively easily as the aperture collapses. Isolator continues to deform after the aperture collapses although isolator does so at much higher loads.

As best seen in various drive train components are disposed between fore frame member sections upon or just above plate . Typically the drive train components will include a transmission a transfer case and a drive shaft connected therebetween. Transmission is affixed to frame member sections in conventional fashion typically by bolts not shown . In addition transmission can be further secured to sections by a stay welded or otherwise fastened to sections and transmission . Transfer case is also fixed to sections typically by means of bolts again not shown although another conventional fastening technique may be used. Depending on the type of vehicle on which shield is installed such automotive components as differentials auxiliary power units bilge pumps drive motors for amphibious operations batteries or other automotive components can be affixed to fore frame member sections . Transmissions transfer cases differentials bilge pumps amphibious drive motors and other automotive components that are not part of vehicle frame or vehicle body are sometimes referred to in blast mitigation parlance simply as automotives or can be called automotive components for convenience.

The pair of frame isolators the pair of wall isolators and a set of cab mounts all work together to cushion cab and floor in a specially coordinated manner. The two isolator pairs are designed such that the distance which the wall isolators collapse is equal to the combined collapsing distance of the frame isolators and the cab mounts. Thus when an on ground or under vehicle blast occurs the loads from the blast shield are divided so as to travel along two separate force paths to floor . The first force path is from the shield through frame isolators fore frame sections cab mounts and thence through brackets to floor . The second force path is from the shield through isolators through side walls and thence to floor . Because of the particular design of the isolators and cab mounts loads from the shield will arrive at different zones of floor . This avoids so called asymmetrical loading wherein the whole load from shield arrives solely through one edge of the floor or from a single zone of the floor. Asymmetrical loading of the floor increases its oscillatory motion which is a key cause of injury to the feet and lower limbs of vehicle occupants whose feet touch the floor.

In addition the blast forces transmitted to frame members accelerate the automotive components engine transmission transfer case differentials and the payload area . By routing the force through the isolators and cab mounts the loading on the floor is reduced by the inertia of the automotive components and payload area being accelerated before the floor. The aforementioned dual path distribution of the floor loading and the load dampening effect of the automotive components minimizes the oscillatory movement of the floor.

Specifically as to the effect of the payload area s inertia it will be noted that payload area is less cushioned that the cab . That is cab mounts are thicker or greater in vertical dimension than cargo area mounts cab mounts are also softer or more compliant than cargo area mounts and under equal force mounts fully compress before mounts . This is one factor causing cargo area to be accelerated by frame members before these frame members accelerate cab in the event of an on ground or under vehicle blast. Another factor causing cargo area to be accelerated first is simply the shock absorption provided by isolators and . Because cargo area is accelerated by the frame members before cab is so accelerated the inertia of cargo area serves to decrease the load on cab when an under vehicle explosion occurs and consequently the inertia of cargo area helps reduce the oscillation of floor .

Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims.
