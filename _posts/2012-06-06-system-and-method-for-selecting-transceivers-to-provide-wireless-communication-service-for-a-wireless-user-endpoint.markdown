The method further comprises analyzing the at least one characteristic of the at least one communication channel. The method additionally comprises selecting at least one transceiver of the first plurality of transceivers to provide wireless communication service for the wireless user endpoint. The selection of the at least one transceiver is based on the at least one characteristic of the at least one communication channel.

For example control units and may communicate over wired connection to coordinate joint communication between wireless user endpoint and transceivers of sub network of sub network and of sub network . Control units may communicate with each other using any suitable wired technologies or protocols e.g. CPRI .

A control unit may be in the same location as a transceiver or may be located remotely from transceivers .

For example control unit may send data destined for wireless user endpoint through wired connections to transceivers and . Transceivers and may then send the data to wireless user endpoint via one or more wireless connections between one or more antenna ports of transceivers and and one or more antenna ports of wireless user endpoint

As another example data from wireless user endpoint may be received by transceivers and through one or more wireless connections between wireless user endpoint and one or more antenna ports of transceivers and . This data may then be relayed to control unit by transceivers and through wired connections which may process the data. Control units and transceivers may communicate with a wireless user endpoint using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA and the long term evolution advanced LTE A protocol as defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Release 10 or beyond.

For example control units may be coupled to one or more LANs WANs MANs PSTNs WiMAX networks global distributed networks such as the Internet or any other form of wireless or wired networking.

A transceiver may include any combination of hardware or software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets with wireless user endpoints via antenna ports of transceivers . For example a transceiver may be a Remote Radio Head RRH . As mentioned above transceivers may communicate with wireless user endpoints using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to OFDMA and the LTE A protocol. Transceivers may be configured to wirelessly send control signals and data traffic to wireless user endpoints via antenna ports using any suitable communications protocol.

Some examples of wireless user endpoints include but are not limited to desktop computers PDAs cell phones laptops and or VoIP phones.

Wireless user endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that may send or receive data and or signals.

Control units and transceivers may utilize any suitable communication scheme to communicate with a wireless user endpoint . For example a multiple input multiple output MIMO scheme may be used that utilizes multiple physical antenna ports to communicate a data stream to a wireless user endpoint . In particular embodiments a control unit may employ a down link coordinated multi processing DL CoMP scheme where multiple antenna ports that are located at one or more transceivers are used to communicate with a wireless user endpoint . The wireless user endpoint may combine multiple signals received from multiple transceivers into a single communication. Similarly in an up link coordinated multi processing scheme UL CoMP a wireless user endpoint may transmit a signal to a plurality of transceivers . The transceivers may forward the signal and or information associated with the signal to a control unit associated with the transceivers . The control unit may interpret and process the information received from the wireless user endpoint via the transceivers .

Various types of information may be sent to or from wireless user endpoints . In some embodiments control units may generate control messages for their respective sub network and may transmit these control messages to the transceivers included in their respective sub networks via connections . These control messages may be jointly transmitted by each antenna port of the transceivers of the sub system . The control messages may include information e.g. scheduling or demodulation information that allows a wireless user endpoint to extract relevant data traffic from transmissions sent from a transceiver . In particular embodiments these control messages conform to the LTE A standard. For example the control messages may include cell specific reference signals CRS such as primary synchronization signal PSS secondary synchronization signal SSS physical broadcast channel PBCH and or physical downlink control channel PDCCH reference signals.

Various other signals may be communicated by control units and transceivers . For example in some embodiments each antenna port of transceivers may transmit a channel reference signal as directed by a control unit such as a channel state information reference signal CSI RS as defined in LTE A. The channel reference signal may include a sequence of values such as a pseudo random sequence. In some embodiments a plurality of transceivers may be organized into a group having an assigned group identifier group ID and may generate and transmit the same reference signal based on the common group ID. In the same or alternative embodiments the transceivers of a sub network may be organized into a group such that all the transceivers of the sub network may have the same group ID and may generate the same reference signal. In alternative embodiments the transceivers of a sub network may be organized into more than one group and or the transceivers of different sub networks may be organized into the same group.

A wireless user endpoint may receive one or more channel reference signals and may estimate one or more associated communication channels between the wireless user endpoint and the one or more antenna ports transmitting the one or more channel reference signals. The wireless user endpoint may estimate a communication channel by determining one or more characteristics of the channel based on a channel reference signal. For example the wireless user endpoint may estimate a channel based on the received signal strength of an associated channel reference signal.

In embodiments where multiple transceivers transmit the same reference signal a composite channel may be estimated as the overall communication between the wireless user endpoint and the group of transceivers transmitting the same reference signal. For example transceivers of sub network may be included in the same group and accordingly have the same group ID and may each transmit the same reference signal. Wireless user endpoint may accordingly receive the same reference signal from each transceiver of sub network . Additionally transceivers of sub network may also be included in the same group but different from the group associated with sub network and each transceiver of sub network may transmit the same reference signal but different from the reference signal associated with sub network such that wireless user endpoint may receive the same reference signal from each transceiver of sub network . Wireless user endpoint may consequently estimate an overall channel for sub network H and may estimate a different overall channel for sub network H .

After estimating the channels a wireless user endpoint may select a channel over which to communicate based on the quality e.g. strength of the channels as indicated by the channel estimations. For example as mentioned above wireless user endpoint may estimate an overall channel for sub network H and may estimate a different overall channel for sub network H . The channel estimations may indicate that channel His stronger than channel Hbecause for example in the illustrated embodiment wireless user endpoint is located within sub group . Accordingly wireless user endpoint may select channel H and consequently sub network for wireless communication.

In accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure a wireless user endpoint may also be configured to generate a reference signal based on the group ID of the selected channel. For example after selecting channel Hfor communication wireless user endpoint may generate a reference signal based on the group ID of sub network . In some embodiments a group ID may be encoded in the reference signal transmitted by transceivers . The reference signal for a wireless user endpoint may be generated based on the group ID such that the reference signal is identified within the group associated with the group ID and ignored outside of the group associated with the group ID. For example the reference signal generated by wireless user endpoint using the group ID of sub network may be such that the reference signal is recognized and processed by control unit and or the transceivers of sub network but the reference signal may not be recognized and processed by control unit and the transceivers of sub network

Any suitable method or scheme may be used to generate a reference signal based on a group ID such that the reference signal is recognized and processed within that group but not another group. For example a group ID may be used to create a sixteen bit sequence within the reference signal that includes a check error sum. The check error sum may be recognized by the transceivers and or control units associated with the group ID and ignored by the transceivers and or control units associated with a different group ID.

In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure one or more transceivers may receive the reference signal generated by a wireless user endpoint and may forward the received reference signal to their associated control unit . Using any suitable system method or device e.g. a check error sum function the control unit may ignore the reference signal if the reference signal does not correspond with a group ID of which the control unit is associated. Alternatively if the reference signal does correspond with a group ID of which the control unit is associated the control unit may perform one or more channel estimations between one or more transceivers and the wireless user endpoint based on the reference signal received from the wireless user endpoint . The control unit may then determine which transceivers of the group of transceivers may provide wireless communication service for the wireless user endpoint based on the channel estimations. Additionally in many instances the channel estimations may indicate the location of the wireless user endpoint such that the control unit may determine the location of the wireless user endpoint based on the estimations. Accordingly the control unit may also or alternatively determine which transceivers may provide wireless communication service for the wireless user endpoint based on the location of the wireless user endpoint . Therefore the control unit may dynamically organize a service cluster of transceivers that may provide wireless coverage for the wireless user endpoint based on the reference signal generated by the wireless user endpoint .

For example one or more transceivers of sub networks and may receive a reference signal generated by wireless user endpoint . The transceivers may forward the reference signal to their respective control unit e.g. control units and . Control unit may ignore the reference signal generated by wireless user endpoint because the reference signal may correspond with the group ID of sub network and not sub network . Conversely control unit may estimate the channels between wireless user endpoint and one or more transceivers of sub network because the reference signal generated by wireless user endpoint may correspond with the group ID of sub network

Based on the channel estimation a control unit may determine which transceivers may provide wireless communication service to a wireless user endpoint . For example the channel estimations performed by control unit may indicate that transceivers and may adequately and efficiently provide wireless communication service to wireless user endpoint . Control unit may consequently select transceivers and to provide wireless communication service for wireless user endpoint based on the estimated channels.

As mentioned above in many instances the channel estimates may be based on the location of the wireless user endpoint with respect to the transceivers such that the stronger channels may be associated with the transceivers closest to wireless user endpoint . Therefore a reference signal generated by a wireless user endpoint may be used by a control unit to determine the location of the wireless user endpoint also.

A wireless user endpoint may configure and generate a reference signal based on a variety of factors in addition to the group ID. For example a wireless user endpoint may generate a reference signal based on a unique identifier associated with the wireless user endpoint such that a control unit processing reference signals may distinguish between reference signals generated by different wireless user endpoints . A wireless user endpoint may in the same or alternative embodiments be configured to generate a unique reference signal pattern e.g. time frequency and or code sequences such that the wireless user endpoint may be identified based on its unique reference signal pattern. A wireless user endpoint may also generate a reference signal based on the antenna configuration of the wireless user endpoint the frequency band of the transceivers within the service cluster and or the available transmission bandwidth.

Also a wireless user endpoint may generate and transmit a reference signal based on traffic data patterns of the wireless user endpoint . For example if a wireless user endpoint is not communicating uplink traffic the wireless user endpoint may generate and transmit the reference signal as a way of providing an update on its location. In some embodiments when sending a location update the wireless user endpoint may transmit only a portion of the reference signal and the serving cluster of transceivers may send an acknowledge ACK signal to the wireless user endpoint upon receiving the location updating reference signal. Such a configuration may allow for location updates without the wireless user endpoint performing a random access procedure for location update.

Further a wireless user endpoint may adjust the repetition rate of a reference signal based on the charge of a battery of the wireless user endpoint . For example if the battery of a wireless user endpoint is running low the wireless user endpoint may reduce how often it generates and transmits a reference signal to reduce power consumption. In contrast if the battery is almost fully charged the wireless user endpoint may generate and transmit a reference signal more often.

Additionally a wireless user endpoint may adjust the repetition rate of a reference signal based on the speed of the wireless user endpoint to allow for appropriate location monitoring of the wireless user endpoint and consequently to allow for changes in the service cluster. For example if a wireless user endpoint is stationary the delay between transmitting reference signals may be increased because the location of the wireless user endpoint is not changing. Accordingly a control unit may not need to make changes in the service cluster of transceivers providing wireless service to the wireless user endpoint . In contrast if a wireless user endpoint is moving the wireless user endpoint may transmit a reference signal more often to provide more frequent channel estimations and accordingly accurate updates on the location of the wireless user endpoint . Consequently a control unit may more accurately determine and change which transceivers may provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint .

Therefore in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure a wireless user endpoint may perform general channel estimation for groups of transceivers based on reference signals associated with the respective groups. Based on the general channel estimation the wireless user endpoint may select a general group of transceivers that may provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint . But a control unit may select which specific transceivers of the general group may provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint based on a reference signal generated by the wireless user endpoint . Accordingly much of the channel estimation and selection of transceivers that may provide wireless communication service for a wireless user endpoint may be on the network side instead of on the wireless user endpoint side. This configuration may allow for reduced power consumption by a wireless user endpoint because the wireless user endpoint may not need to perform as many individual channel estimations associated with different transceivers . Such a configuration may be especially advantageous in distributed antenna networks with densely distributed transceivers .

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to distributed antenna system without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example the number of sub networks and control units and transceivers included in each sub network may vary. Additionally the organization of groups of transceivers and control units having group IDs may vary. Further in some embodiments control units may be located within a transceiver or separate from a transceiver .

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example any of the options or features described herein may be utilized in combination with the illustrated embodiments of FIGURE and and or any number of the other options or features also described herein as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Method may start and at step a wireless user endpoint within range of a distributed antenna network may receive one or more reference signals from one or more transceivers of the distributed antenna network. At step the wireless user endpoint may estimate one or more channels associated with the one or more received reference signals. At step the wireless user endpoint may select a channel for wireless communication based on the channel estimation performed at step . As described above transceivers may be organized into groups where each transceiver of the same group generates and transmits the same reference signal. Therefore from the perspective of the wireless user endpoint the plurality of same reference signals may be associated with the same channel such that a selected channel may include a plurality of transceivers .

The wireless user endpoint may generate a reference signal based on the selected channel at step . For example as described above a channel and its respective transceivers may be associated with a group having a group ID. Therefore the user endpoint may generate a reference signal based on the group ID associated with the selected channel. The wireless user endpoint may also generate the reference signal based on a variety of factors such as those described above with respect to . At step the wireless user endpoint may transmit its reference signal.

At step one or more transceivers may receive the reference signal generated by the wireless user endpoint . At step the transceivers may determine whether the reference signal corresponds to the group ID associated with the respective transceivers . If the reference signal corresponds to the group ID associated with a transceiver the transceiver may forward the reference signal and or data associated with the reference signal to a control unit associated with the transceiver and method may proceed to step . If the reference signal does not correspond to the group ID associated with a transceiver the transceiver may ignore the reference signal and method may end. In alternative embodiments a transceiver may forward data associated with the received reference signal to a control unit associated with the transceiver . The control unit may determine whether the reference signal is associated with the group ID of the respective transceivers .

At step the control unit may determine which transceivers may provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint based on the reference signal received by the transceivers from the wireless user endpoint . For example as described above the control unit may estimate the channels between the wireless user endpoint and the transceivers that receive the reference signal from the wireless user endpoint . Based on the channel estimations the control unit may determine which transceivers may best provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint . At step based on this determination the control unit may select a group or service cluster of transceivers that may provide wireless communication service to the wireless user endpoint . Following step method may end.

Therefore in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure method may be used to generate a reference signal by a wireless user endpoint and a group of transceivers may be selected to provide wireless communication service for the wireless user endpoint based on the reference signal. Accordingly much of the channel estimation and selection of transceivers that may provide wireless communication service for a wireless user endpoint may be on the network side instead of on the wireless user endpoint side. This configuration may allow for reduced power consumption by a wireless user endpoint because the wireless user endpoint may not need to perform as many individual channel estimations associated with different transceivers . Such a configuration may be especially advantageous in distributed antenna networks with densely distributed transceivers .

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to method without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example as mentioned above different components may perform different operations than those explicitly described. Further the order of operations of each step may vary from what is described. Additionally each step may include a plurality of other steps other than those specifically described.

Numerous other changes substitutions variations alterations and modifications may be ascertained by those skilled in the art and it is intended that particular embodiments encompass all such changes substitutions variations alterations and modifications as falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
