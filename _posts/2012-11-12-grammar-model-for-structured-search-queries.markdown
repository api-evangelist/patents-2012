This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments in response to a text query received from a user a social networking system may generate structured queries comprising query tokens that correspond to identified social graph elements. By providing suggested structured queries in response to a user s text query the social networking system may provide a powerful way for users of an online social network to search for elements represented in a social graph based on their social graph attributes and their relation to various social graph elements.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive a substantially unstructured text query from a user. In response the social networking system may access a social graph and then parse the text query to identify social graph elements that corresponded to n grams from the text query. The social networking system may identify these corresponding social graph elements by determining a probability for each n gram that it corresponds to a particular social graph element. The social networking system may then access a grammar model such as a context free grammar model. The identified social graph elements may be used as terminal tokens query tokens in the grammars of the grammar model and each grammar may then be scored. Grammars with a score greater than a threshold score may be used to generate structured queries that include query tokens referencing the identified social graph elements. The structured queries may then be transmitted and displayed to the user where the user can then select an appropriate query to search for the desired content.

As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more client side and or backend server side processes implement and utilize a typeahead feature to automatically attempt to match concepts corresponding to respective existing user nodes or concept nodes to information currently being entered by a user in an input form rendered in conjunction with a requested webpage such as a user profile page which may be hosted or accessible in by the social networking system . In particular embodiments as a user is entering text to make a declaration the typeahead feature attempts to match the string of textual characters being entered in the declaration to strings of characters e.g. names corresponding to existing concepts or users and corresponding concept or user nodes in the social graph . In particular embodiments when a match is found the typeahead feature may automatically populate the form with a reference to the node such as for example the node name node ID or another suitable reference or identifier of the existing node.

In particular embodiments as a user types or otherwise enters text into a form used to add content or make declarations in various sections of the user s profile page or other page the typeahead process may work in conjunction with one or more frontend client side and or backend server side typeahead processes hereinafter referred to simply as typeahead process executing at or within the social networking system e.g. within servers to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user attempt to auto populate the form with a term or terms corresponding to names of existing social graph entities or terms associated with existing social graph entities determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters of text entered by the user as the user enters the characters of text. Utilizing the social graph information in a social graph database or information extracted and indexed from the social graph database including information associated with nodes and edges the typeahead processes in conjunction with the information from the social graph database as well as potentially in conjunction with various others processes applications or databases located within or executing within social networking system are able to predict a user s intended declaration with a high degree of precision. However social networking system also provides user s with the freedom to enter any declaration they wish enabling users to express themselves freely.

In particular embodiments as a user enters text characters into a form box or other field the typeahead processes may attempt to identify existing social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered in the user s declaration as the user is entering the characters. In particular embodiments as the user enters characters into a form box the typeahead process may read the string of entered textual characters. As each keystroke is made the frontend typeahead process may transmit the entered character string as a request or call to the backend typeahead process executing within social networking system . In particular embodiments the typeahead processes may communicate via AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or other suitable techniques and particularly asynchronous techniques. In one particular embodiment the request is or comprises an XMLHTTPRequest XHR enabling quick and dynamic sending and fetching of results. In particular embodiments the typeahead process also transmits before after or with the request a section identifier section ID that identifies the particular section of the particular page in which the user is making the declaration. In particular embodiments a user ID parameter may also be sent but this may be unnecessary in some embodiments as the user is already known based on he or she logging into social networking system .

In particular embodiments the typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching social graph elements. In particular embodiments when a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching social graph elements as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user entering the characters pok into a query field the typeahead process may display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes e.g. a profile page named or devoted to poker which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to declare the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node. As another example and not by way of limitation upon clicking poker the typeahead process may auto populate or causes the web browser to auto populate the query field with the declaration poker . In particular embodiments the typeahead process may simply auto populate the field with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu. The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on his or her keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration.

More information on typeahead processes may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the typeahead processes described herein may be applied to search queries entered by a user. As an example and not by way of limitation as a user enters text characters into a search field a typeahead process may attempt to identify one or more user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered search field as the user is entering the characters. As the typeahead process receives requests or calls including a string or n gram from the text query the typeahead process may perform or causes to be performed a search to identify existing social graph elements i.e. user nodes concept nodes edges having respective names types categories or other identifiers matching the entered text. The typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching nodes or edges. When a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching nodes as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching nodes. The typeahead process may then display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes and displays names of matching edges that may connect to the matching user nodes or concept nodes which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to search for the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node or to search for users or concepts connected to the matched users or concepts by the matching edges. Alternatively the typeahead process may simply auto populate the form with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu . The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on a keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration. Upon user confirmation of the matching nodes and edges the typeahead process may transmit a request that informs the social networking system of the user s confirmation of a query containing the matching social graph elements. In response to the request transmitted the social networking system may automatically or alternately based on an instruction in the request call or otherwise search a social graph database for the matching social graph elements or for social graph elements connected to the matching social graph elements as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes applying the typeahead processes to search queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates applying the typeahead processes to search queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node a substantially unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into query field as illustrated in . As the first user enters this text query into query field the social networking system may provide various suggested structured queries as illustrated in drop down menus . As used herein a substantially unstructured text query refers to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simply text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the substantially unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo also friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine or calculate for each n gram identified in the text query a score that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a probability score also referred to simply as a probability that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element such as a user node a concept node or an edge of social graph . The probability score may indicate the level of similarity or relevance between the n gram and a particular social graph element. There may be many different ways to calculate the probability. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable method to calculate a probability score for an n gram identified in a search query. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. The probability p may be calculated as the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X. In other words the probability may be calculated as p k X . As an example and not by way of limitation a probability that an n gram corresponds to a social graph element may calculated as an probability score denoted as p. The input may be a text query X x x . . . x and a set of classes. For each i j and a class k the social networking system may compute p p class x k X . As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford Calif. 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. As another example and not by way of limitation the n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. In particular embodiments the social networking system may user a forward backward algorithm to determine the probability that a particular n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. For a given n gram within a text query the social networking system may use both the preceding and succeeding n grams to determine which particular social graph elements correspond to the given n gram. Although this disclosure describes determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using a particular type of score this disclosure contemplates determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using any suitable type of score.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more edges having a probability greater than an edge threshold probability. Each of the identified edges may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to an edge k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified edges may be connected to at least one of the identified nodes. In other words the social networking system may only identify edges or edge types that are connected to user nodes or concept nodes that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Edges or edge types that are not connected to any previously identified node are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these edges and edge types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing for a text query containing went to Stanford where an identified concept node is the school Stanford the social networking system may identify the edges corresponding to worked at and the edges corresponding to attended both of which are connected to the concept node for Stanford. Thus the n gram went to may be identified as corresponding to these edges . However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the edges corresponding to like or fan in the social graph because the Stanford node does not have any such edges connected to it. Although this disclosure describes identifying edges that corresponding to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying edges that corresponding to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more user nodes or concept nodes having a probability greater than a node threshold probability. Each of the identified nodes may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to a node k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified user nodes or concept nodes may be connected to at least one of the identified edges . In other words the social networking system may only identify nodes or nodes types that are connected to edges that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Nodes or node types that are not connected to any previously identified edges are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these nodes and node types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation for a text query containing worked at Apple where an identified edge is worked at the social networking system may identify the concept node corresponding to the company APPLE INC. which may have multiple edges of worked at connected to it. However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the concept node corresponding to the fruit type apple which may have multiple like or fan edges connected to it but no worked at edge connections. In particular embodiments the node threshold probability may differ for user nodes and concept nodes The n gram may be identified as corresponding to a user node kif p p while the n gram may be identified as corresponding to a concept node kif p p. In particular embodiments the social networking system may only identify nodes that are within a threshold degree of separation of the user node corresponding to the first user i.e. the querying user . The threshold degree of separation may be for example one two three or all. Although this disclosure describes identifying nodes that corresponding to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying nodes that corresponding to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may access a context free grammar model comprising a plurality of grammars. Each grammar of the grammar model may comprise one or more non terminal symbols that may be replaced by query tokens. A grammar model is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. To generate a string in the language one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then applied in any order until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated non terminal symbols is produced. In a context free grammar the production of each non terminal symbol of the grammar is independent of what is produced by other non terminal symbols of the grammar. The non terminal symbols may be replaced with terminal symbols i.e. terminal tokens or query tokens . Some of the query tokens may correspond to identified nodes or identified edges as described previously. A string generated by the grammar may then be used as a structured query containing references to the identified nodes or identified edges. A context free grammar is a grammar in which the left hand side of each production rule consists of only a single non terminal symbol. A probabilistic context free grammar is a tuple E N S P where the disjoint sets and N specify the terminal and non terminal symbols respectively with S N being the start symbol. P is the set of productions which take the form E p with E N N and p Pr E the probability that E will be expanded into the string . The sum of probabilities p over all expansions of a given non terminal E must be one. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular grammars this disclosure contemplates any suitable grammars.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may identify one or more grammars having query tokens corresponding to the previously identified nodes and edges. In other words if an identified node or identified edge may be used as a query token in a particular grammar that grammar may be identified by the social networking system as a possible grammar to use for generating a structured query. This is effectively a type of bottom up parsing where the possible query tokens are used to determine the applicable grammar to apply to the query. As an example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter school . The non terminal symbols user user filter and school could then be determined based n grams in the received text query. For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . As another example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter location . For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who live in Stanford Calif. . In both the example cases above if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens in the grammars then these grammars may be identified by the social networking system . Similarly if the received text query comprises n grams that could not be used as query tokens in the grammar that grammar may not be identified. Although this disclosure describes identifying particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for each identified grammar. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. The score may be based on the individual scores or probabilities associated with the query tokens of the grammar. A grammar may have a higher relative score if it uses query tokens with relatively higher individual scores. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior examples the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford Calif. 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. The n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. Thus the grammar user user filter school may have a relatively high score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the school Stanford University generating for example the string friends who go to Stanford University both of which have relatively high individual scores. In contrast the grammar user user filter user may have relatively low score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the user Allen Stanford generating for example the string friends of Allen Stanford since the latter query token has a relatively low individual score. Although this disclosure describes determining particular scores for particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable scores for any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for an identified grammar based on the relevance of the social graph elements corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar to the querying user i.e. the first user corresponding to a first user node . User nodes and concept nodes that are connected to the first user node directly by an edge may be considered relevant to the first user. Thus grammars comprising query tokens corresponding to these relevant nodes and edges may be considered more relevant to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept node connected by an edge to a first user node may be considered relevant to the first user node . As used herein when referencing a social graph the term connected means a path exists within the social graph between two nodes wherein the path may comprise one or more edges and zero or more intermediary nodes. In particular embodiments nodes that are connected to the first user node via one or more intervening nodes and therefore two or more edges may also be considered relevant to the first user. Furthermore in particular embodiments the closer the second node is to the first user node the more relevant the second node may be considered to the first user node. That is the fewer edges separating the first user node from a particular user node or concept node i.e. the fewer degrees of separation the more relevant that user node or concept node may be considered to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford is connected to the user node corresponding to User C and thus the concept Stanford may be considered relevant to User C. As another example and not by way of limitation the user node corresponding to User A is connected to the user node corresponding to User C via one intermediate node and two edges i.e. the intermediated user node corresponding to User B and thus User A may be considered relevant to User C but because the user node for User A is a second degree connection with respect to User C that particular concept node may be considered less relevant than a user node that is connected to the user node for User C by a single edge such as for example the user node corresponding to User B. As yet another example and not by way of limitation the concept node for Online Poker which is an online multiplayer game is not connected to the user node for User C by any pathway in social graph and thus the concept Online Poker may not be considered relevant to User C. In particular embodiments a second node may only be considered relevant to the first user if the second node is within a threshold degree of separation of the first user node . As an example and not by way of limitation if the threshold degree of separation is three then the user node corresponding to User D may be considered relevant to the concept node corresponding to the recipe Chicken Parmesan which are within three degrees of each other on social graph illustrated in . However continuing with this example the concept node corresponding to the application All About Recipes would not be considered relevant to the user node corresponding to User D because these nodes are four degrees apart in the social graph . Although this disclosure describes determining whether particular social graph elements and thus their corresponding query tokens are relevant to each other in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether any suitable social graph elements are relevant to each other in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether particular query tokens corresponding to user nodes and concept nodes are relevant to a querying user this disclosure contemplates similarly determining whether any suitable query token and thus any suitable node is relevant to any other suitable user.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for an identified grammar based social graph information corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation when determining a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element the calculation of the probability may also factor in social graph information. Thus the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X and social graph information G may be calculated as p k X G . The individual probabilities for the identified nodes and edges may then be used to determine the score for a grammar using those social graph elements as query tokens. In particular embodiments the score for an identified grammar may be based on the degree of separation between the first user node and the particular social graph element used as a query token in the grammar. Grammars with query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are closer in the social graph to the querying user i.e. fewer degrees of separation between the element and the first user node than a social graph element that is further from the user i.e. more degrees of separation . As an example and not by way of limitation referencing if user B inputs a text query of chicken a grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for the recipe Chicken Parmesan which is connected to user B by an edge may have a relatively higher score than a grammar with a query token corresponding to other nodes associated with the n gram chicken e.g. concept nodes corresponding to chicken nuggets or funky chicken dance that are not connected to user B in the social graph . In particular embodiments the score for an identified grammar may be based on the identified edges corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. If the social networking system has already identified one or more edges that correspond to n grams in a received text query those identified edges may then be considered when determining the score for a particular parsing of the text query by the grammar. If a particular grammar comprises query tokens that correspond to both identified nodes and identified edges if the identified nodes are not actually connected to any of the identified edges that particular grammar may be assigned a zero or null score. In particular embodiments the score for an identified grammar may be based on the number of edges connected to the node corresponding to a query token of the grammar. Grammars comprising query tokens that corresponding to nodes with more connecting edges may be more popular and more likely to be a target of a search query. As an example and not by way of limitation if the concept node for Stanford Calif. is only connected by five edges while the concept node for Stanford University is connected by five thousand edges when determining the score for grammars containing query tokens corresponding to either of these nodes the social networking system may determine that the grammar referencing the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively higher score than a grammar referencing the concept node for Stanford Calif. because of the greater number of edges connected to the former concept node . In particular embodiments the score for an identified grammar may be based on the search history associate with the first user i.e. the querying user . Grammars with query tokens corresponding to nodes that the first user has previously accessed or are relevant to the nodes the first user has previously accessed may be more likely to be the target of the first user s search query. Thus these grammars may be given a higher score. As an example and not by way of limitation if first user has previously visited the Stanford University profile page but has never visited the Stanford Calif. profile page when determining the score for grammars with query tokens corresponding to these concepts the social networking system may determine that the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for the school. As another example and not by way of limitation if the first user has previously visited the concept profile page for the television show Friends when determining the score for the grammar with the query token corresponding to that concept the social networking system may determine that the concept node corresponding to the television show Friends has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for that television show. Although this disclosure describes determining scores for particular grammars based on particular social graph information in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining scores for any suitable grammars based on any suitable social graph information in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may select one or more grammars having a score greater than a grammar threshold score. Each of the selected grammars may contain query tokens that correspond to at least one of the identified nodes or identified edges which correspond to n grams of the received text query . In particular embodiments the grammars may be ranked based on their determined scores and only grammars within a threshold rank may be selected e.g. top seven . Although this disclosure describes selecting grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries corresponding to an identified grammar having a score greater than a grammar threshold score. Each structure query may be based on a string generated by the corresponding identified grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends stanford the grammar user user filter school may generate a string friends who go to Stanford University where the non terminal tokens user user filter school of the grammar have been replaced by the terminal tokens friends who go to and Stanford University respectively to generate the string. Each structured query may comprise query tokens corresponding to the corresponding identified grammar where these query tokens correspond to one or more of the identified edges and one or more of the identified nodes. Generating structured queries is described more below.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries that each comprise the query tokens of the corresponding grammar where the query tokens may correspond to one or more of the identified user nodes or one or more of the identified edges . The generated structured queries may be based on context free grammars as described previously. This type of structured search query may allow the social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by searching for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified user nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query show me friends of my girlfriend the social networking system may generate a structured query Friends of Stephanie where Friends and Stephanie in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements. The reference to Stephanie would correspond to a particular user node while the reference to friends would correspond to friend edges connecting that user node to other user nodes i.e. edges connecting to Stephanie s first degree friends . When executing this structured query the social networking system may identify one or more user nodes connected by friend edges to the user node corresponding to Stephanie. In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a plurality of structured queries where the structured queries may comprise references to different identified user nodes or different identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query photos of cat the social networking system may generate a first structured query Photos of Catey and a second structured query Photos of Catherine where Photos in the structured query is a reference corresponding to a particular social graph element and where Catey and Catherine are references to two different user nodes . When executing either of these structured queries the social networking system may identify one or more concept nodes corresponding to photos that are connected to the identified user nodes by edges . Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries that each comprise query tokens corresponding to the identified concept nodes and one or more of the identified edges . This type of structured search query may allow the social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by search for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified concept nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends who like facebook the social networking system may generate a structured query Friends who like Facebook where Friends like and Facebook in the structured query are query tokens corresponding to particular social graph elements as described previously i.e. a friend edge a like edge and a Facebook concept node . In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a plurality of structured queries where the structured queries may comprise references to different identified concept nodes or different identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the previous example in addition to the structured query Friends who like Facebook the social networking system may also generate a structured query Friends who like Facebook Culinary Team where Facebook Culinary Team in the structured query is a query token corresponding to yet another social graph element. In particular embodiments social networking system may rank the generated structured queries. The structured queries may be ranked based on a variety of factors. Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may transmit one or more of the structured queries to the first user i.e. the querying user . As an example and not by way of limitation after the structured queries are generated the social networking system may transmit one or more of the structured queries as a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the referenced social graph elements other query limitations e.g. Boolean operators etc. as well as potentially other metadata associated with the referenced social graph elements. The web browser on the querying user s client system may display the transmitted structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in . In particular embodiments the transmitted queries may be presented to the querying user in a ranked order such as for example based on a rank previously determined as described above. Structured queries with better rankings may be presented in a more prominent position. Furthermore in particular embodiments only structured queries above a threshold rank may be transmitted or displayed to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the structured queries may be presented to the querying user in a drop down menu where higher ranked structured queries may be presented at the top of the menu with lower ranked structured queries presented in descending order down the menu. In the examples illustrated in only the seven highest ranked queries are transmitted and displayed to the user. In particular embodiments one or more references in a structured query may be highlighted in order to indicate its correspondence to a particular social graph element. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the references to Stanford University and Stanford Calif. may be highlighted in the structured queries to indicate that it corresponds to a particular concept node . Similarly the references to Friends like work at and go to in the structured queries presented in drop down menu could also be highlighted to indicate that they correspond to particular edges . Although this disclosure describes transmitting particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates transmitting any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from the first user i.e. the querying user a selection of one of the structured queries. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser on the querying user s client system may display the transmitted structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in which the user may then click on or otherwise select e.g. by simply keying enter on his keyboard to indicate the particular structured query the user wants the social networking system to execute. Upon selecting the particular structured query the user s client system may call or otherwise instruct to the social networking system to execute the selected structured query. Although this disclosure describes receiving selections of particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving selections of any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.
